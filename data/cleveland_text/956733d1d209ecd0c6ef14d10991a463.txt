Management and Treatment
How do I treat headaches when I’m hungry?

How soon will I feel better?
Once your body starts digesting food, you should start feeling better. Hunger headaches typically go away within 30 minutes of eating.

What if hunger headaches are due to dieting?
Your body is sensitive to changes in eating habits. When you’re dieting, it’s natural to feel hungry. But when hunger pangs come with head pain, try eating a little more. You might not lose weight as fast, but it’ll spare you the discomfort of regular headaches.
What if I can’t eat for a day because I’m fasting for religious purposes?
Fasting headaches are common. You can lower your risk by planning ahead.
A few days before the fast:
Avoid caffeine.
Eat nutritious meals.
Increase the amount of water you’re drinking.
The meal before the fast:
Consume complex carbohydrates, like potatoes and other starchy vegetables, with some protein.
Don’t eat portions that are larger than normal.
