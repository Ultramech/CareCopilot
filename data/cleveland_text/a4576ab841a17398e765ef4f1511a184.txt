Left Anterior Fascicular Block
With a left anterior fascicular block, the left ventricle in your heart contracts later than normal because your heart’s electrical signal can’t get through when it should. Although people with this issue don’t usually have symptoms or need treatment, they are likely to have other heart issues in the future.
