Postictal State
The postictal state is a temporary group of symptoms you feel immediately after a seizure and before you feel well again. Not everyone who experiences a seizure goes through this state, but many people do. Common symptoms include exhaustion, confusion and sore muscles. It goes away within minutes to days.

Overview
What is the postictal state of a seizure?
The postictal state is a temporary
brain
condition that happens when a
seizure
ends and before you feel like yourself again. It’s a group of symptoms that affect your behavior, thoughts, feelings and ability to function as expected.

Imagine an athlete who just finished running in a race. They’re tired after pushing their body to reach the finish line. After the race, they may cool down by stretching, rehydrating and resting. This cool-down period is the postictal state.
During a seizure, your neurons (
nerve
cells) create a burst of electrical activity in your brain. Now, they’re exhausted and trying to recover. During your brain’s recovery, you may feel confused, have a headache or have trouble remembering things. You may need to spend the day in bed resting and avoiding activities requiring a lot of brain power or physical exertion.
The postictal state could last for a few minutes to a few days. Each person’s experience in the postictal state is different.
How common is the postictal state?
The majority of people who experience a seizure notice postictal state symptoms. The condition is temporary.

What are the complications of the postictal state?
Seizures can have a significant impact on your mental health. You may feel nervous and fearful that another seizure will happen. You may isolate yourself from others if you have a seizure in a public place where other people are watching you. These thoughts and feelings may be overwhelming while in the postictal state. You may notice symptoms of depression and anxiety lingering even after you’ve completely recovered.
A mental health professional can help you manage the effects of seizures on your mental health and emotional well-being.
In some cases, you may experience suicidal thoughts (suicidal ideation). If you find yourself feeling this way and need someone to talk to, reach out to the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting
988
. Someone is available 24/7 to help you if you’re in a rough spot.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is the postictal state diagnosed?
Healthcare providers usually don’t make a formal postictal state diagnosis, especially if you have a history of seizures. The signs and symptoms you experience indicate that you’re in the postictal state.
In some cases, the presence of postictal state symptoms may help your provider diagnose a seizure if it happened outside of a healthcare facility for the first time. If this is the case, a healthcare provider may order tests to confirm, like:
Blood tests
.
EEG
.
MRI
.
PET scan
.
Lumbar puncture
.
Management and Treatment
How is the postictal state treated?
There isn’t a specific treatment available for the postictal state. Supportive care, like reassurance that you’re safe, resting and taking an over-the-counter pain reliever (as directed) for a headache, may be all that you need.
Symptoms usually go away on their own within a day after a seizure. However, it’s important to update your provider that a seizure occurred because they may want to make changes to your treatment.
In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend
antiseizure medications
,
triptans
or psychotropic medications (like
antidepressants
) depending on the frequency of seizures and how severe postictal state symptoms are.
Your provider may offer
sedatives
and supportive care in a clinical setting if you experience psychosis symptoms.

How long does the postictal state last?
The postictal state can last anywhere from minutes to days. On average, it lasts between five and 30 minutes. The timeframe varies from person to person and seizure to seizure. When this phase of a seizure is over, you’ll start feeling more like yourself. If symptoms last longer than 24 hours, contact your healthcare provider.
Do all seizures have a postictal state?
No. Not everyone who experiences a seizure will go through the postictal state. Each seizure is different, and so is the way it affects you.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Seizures can take a toll on your body, so it’s common to feel lousy after one. You likely won’t want to go to work or school, answer the telephone or get out of bed until you feel better. Luckily, you should start feeling more like yourself within a day. Let your healthcare provider know if you’re in the postictal state for longer than 24 hours or have different symptoms than what you’re used to. They may make recommendations to help you manage seizures and return to your routine with a shorter recovery time.
