Healthcare providers prescribe them for other conditions, as well.
Is metformin the only biguanide?
Yes,
metformin
is the only biguanide available in most countries. Its brand names include:
Glucophage®.
Glucophage XR®.
Glumetza®.
Fortamet®.
Riomet®.
What conditions do biguanides treat or manage?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved metformin (the only biguanide) in 1994 for the management of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since then, metformin has become the most widely prescribed oral diabetes medication and first-line therapy for T2D.
Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe biguanides for other conditions. This is an off-label, or non-FDA-approved, use of the medication. Non-FDA-approved uses of metformin include:
Management of
gestational diabetes
.
Management of
prediabetes
.
Management of
Type 1 diabetes
.
Management of
antipsychotic medication
-induced weight gain.
Treatment and prevention of
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
.
Researchers are also studying biguanides for their anticancer effects. Studies show that people taking metformin for diabetes have a significant reduction in their risk of cancer.
How common are biguanides?
Biguanides (metformin) are a very common medication. In 2020, there were approximately 92 million prescriptions for metformin in the U.S.
Treatment Details
How do biguanides work?
Biguanides lower
blood glucose (sugar) levels
by decreasing the amount of glucose your
liver
produces and releases into your bloodstream. They also help lower blood glucose levels by making your
skeletal muscle
tissue more sensitive to
insulin
so it can absorb glucose for energy. This increases insulin sensitivity and reduces
insulin resistance
. These bodily changes help manage diabetes.

In PCOS, biguanides decreases insulin levels, which then decrease
luteinizing hormone
and
androgen
levels. This helps regulate your
menstrual cycle
(period).
How long will I need to take biguanides?
Diabetes is typically a chronic condition (except for gestational diabetes), so you’ll likely take metformin long-term. It’s important to remember that diabetes management involves several strategies, including regular exercise and meal planning. While metformin is effective, it alone can’t treat diabetes.
Your healthcare provider will be able to give you more information about how long you’ll take metformin and other strategies to best manage diabetes.

Risks / Benefits
What are the potential benefits of biguanides?
Biguanides are effective. For people with Type 2 diabetes, biguanides (metformin) can decrease their
A1C
levels by about 1%.
Studies show that biguanides are also effective in preventing or delaying the development of Type 2 diabetes in people at high risk. A study demonstrated that intensive lifestyle intervention and metformin therapy reduced progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 58% and 31%, respectively.
Studies also show that metformin may decrease your risk for
cardiovascular disease
.
What are the side effects of biguanides?
Common side effects of biguanides (metformin) include
diarrhea
and
nausea
and
vomiting
. They affect up to 30% of people taking the medication.
Less common side effects include:
Chest discomfort.
Headache.
Excessive sweating (
diaphoresis
).
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
.
Weakness.
What are the risks or complications of biguanides?
Biguanides (metformin) are generally safe, but taking them may result in certain complications, including:
Vitamin B12 deficiency
.
Lactic acidosis
.
Drug interactions.
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Long-term use of metformin may cause your vitamin B12 levels to decrease. Your healthcare provider will likely monitor your levels while you take the medication, especially if you have
anemia
or
peripheral neuropathy
. Your provider may recommend a vitamin B12 supplement.
Lactic acidosis
Metformin has a
black box warning
for lactic acidosis. This is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication. It affects every 1 in 30,000 people taking metformin. Your provider will be monitoring your kidney function levels while you take the medication. They’ll tell you to stop taking it if there’s any noted change in your kidney function.
Lactic acidosis happens when lactic acid builds up in your body, which leads to
metabolic acidosis
. Risk factors for lactic acidosis include:
Liver disease
or
kidney disease
.
Being over the age of 65.
Recently having had surgery.
Low oxygen levels (
hypoxia
).
Alcohol use disorder
.

Symptoms of lactic acidosis and metabolic acidosis include:
Fatigue
.
Weakness.
Nausea and vomiting.
Abdominal pain
.
Rapid breathing or long, deep breathing.
If you have these symptoms, call 911 (or your local emergency services number) or go to the nearest emergency department as soon as possible.
While this complication is rare, if lactic acidosis isn’t treated in time, it can lead to death.
Drug interactions
Taking metformin with other medications can lead to complications. Before starting any new medication, make sure you tell your healthcare provider about all the medications you take, including prescriptions, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and supplements.
Taking certain medications while also taking biguanides may increase your risk of developing lactic acidosis. They include (but aren’t limited to):
Bupropion
.
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
Cephalexin
.
Cimetidine
.
Dolutegravir
.
Glycopyrrolate
.
Lamotrigine
.
Ranolazine
.
Topiramate
.
Taking certain medications in addition to biguanides can increase your risk of experiencing low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). They include:
Androgens.
Alpha-lipoic acid.
Salicylates.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
.
Quinolones.
Prothionamide.
Pegvisomant
.
When To Call the Doctor
