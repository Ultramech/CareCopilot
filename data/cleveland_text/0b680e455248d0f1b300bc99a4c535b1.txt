Phantosmia (Olfactory Hallucinations)
Phantosmia is a condition that causes you to detect smells that aren’t actually in your environment. It can happen in one nostril or both — and the odors may be foul or pleasant. Common causes include colds, allergies, nasal polyps and dental issues. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.

Overview
What is phantosmia?

In most cases, phantosmia isn’t a cause for concern and will go away in time. However, in rare instances, it could indicate a more serious health condition, such as Parkinson’s disease, stroke or a brain tumor.
Another name for phantosmia is olfactory hallucinations.
How common is phantosmia?
Phantosmia isn’t very common. When it comes to disorders that affect your sense of smell, phantosmia makes up 10% to 20% of cases.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of phantosmia?

Rotting food.
Burnt toast.
Tobacco smoke.
Chemicals.
A metallic odor.
A moldy or stale smell.
Some people detect smells they can’t identify or odors they’ve never noticed before.

Colds.
Sinus infections
.
Upper respiratory infections
.
Allergies
.
Nasal polyps
.
Migraines
.
Taking certain medications.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is phantosmia diagnosed?
First, a healthcare provider will need to determine why you’re having phantom smells. Determining the underlying cause will help them choose an appropriate path of treatment.
During this appointment, a provider will examine your
nose
,
ears
, head and neck. They’ll also ask questions about your symptoms, including what kinds of odors you smell, how long they last and whether you smell them in one or both nostrils.
What tests can help diagnose phantosmia?
Your healthcare provider may need to run certain tests to find out what’s causing you to smell phantom odors. These tests may include:
Nasal endoscopy
. During this procedure, a healthcare provider inserts an endoscope into your nose to look at your nasal passages and sinuses. (An endoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera.)
Imaging tests
, including
CT (computed tomography) scans
or
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
.
Electroencephalogram
. This safe and painless test measures your
brain’s
activity. It can let your healthcare provider know if you have any brain-related conditions.
Management and Treatment
How is phantosmia treated?
It depends on the underlying cause. When phantosmia is a result of colds, allergies or infections, the phantom smells should stop once you recover.
Treating neurological (brain-related) cases of phantosmia is more challenging. There are different treatments depending on the exact cause. For example, people who have epilepsy may need medication or surgery. A person with a brain tumor will need
chemotherapy
and/or
radiation therapy
.
Once your healthcare provider determines the root cause of phantosmia, they’ll recommend the appropriate treatment.
Home remedies for phantosmia
People with phantosmia may find relief with these home remedies:
Nasal irrigation
. Rinse your nasal passages using a
neti pot
or over-the-counter saline solution.
Nasal sprays
. Use oxymetazoline spray to reduce nasal congestion. You can purchase this nasal spray over the counter.

Outlook / Prognosis
Does phantosmia ever go away?
Phantosmia is usually temporary and should go away in a few weeks. But your symptoms may linger if a neurological issue is the cause. You should see a healthcare provider if phantom smells last for more than a few weeks.
How long does phantosmia last?
The answer to this question is different for everyone. If phantosmia is a result of a cold or infection, symptoms should go away once your condition improves. But if phantosmia is a result of a neurological issue, then symptoms can linger much longer — sometimes, for years.
Prevention
Can I prevent phantosmia?
You can’t prevent phantosmia because it’s often a symptom of other unpreventable illnesses and conditions. However, once you find out what caused phantosmia, you can take steps to reduce your risk.
How can I lower my risk for phantosmia?
To reduce your risk of phantosmia, avoid potential triggers and make any necessary lifestyle changes:
Stop smoking
.
Ask your healthcare provider about switching medications that could cause phantom smells.
Keep your allergies in check.
Seek immediate care for colds and other infections.
Fix any existing dental issues.
Wash your hands frequently to lower your risk of infections.

Why am I experiencing phantom smells?
How long will this last?
Do I need treatment for an underlying condition?
What are some ways I can ease my symptoms?

otolaryngologist
(ENT) or another healthcare specialist?
