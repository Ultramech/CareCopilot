Eye floaters
.
Farsightedness (
hyperopia

Headache
.

What causes age-related eye conditions?
As you age, you may notice changes in your body. Some of these changes can weaken your vision and eyes. For example:
After age 40, your tear production tends to decrease, causing dry eyes.
Proteins in your lens start to break down as you get older, which can lead to cataracts.
The vitreous, a gel-like fluid in the middle of your eye, starts to shrink as you age, which can cause floaters or retinal detachment.
The lens of the eye becomes less flexible, which can cause presbyopia, or reduced near vision.
What are some complications of age-related eye problems?
Eye conditions can increase your risk of injury due to falls or accidents. Your
eye care specialists
may also find indications of other health problems during your eye exam.
Sometimes, eye problems can indicate:
Aneurysm
.
Cancer
.
Diabetes
.
Heart disease
.
High blood pressure (
hypertension
).
Multiple sclerosis (MS)
.
Sjögren’s syndrome
.
Vitamin A deficiency
.
Stroke
.
Tumors
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are age-related eye problems diagnosed?
Eye care specialists diagnose and treat problems that affect your eyes using several tests. A comprehensive
eye exam
includes eye dilation (
ophthalmoscopy or fundoscopy
). This test gives your specialist a complete view of the back of your eye (your
retina
).
During this procedure, your ophthalmologist:
Puts drops in your eyes.
Waits for 15 to 20 minutes for your pupils to fully widen (dilate).
Shines a light in your eye to look for signs of eye disease or other conditions.
You typically wear sunglasses or disposable shades until your
pupils
return to normal. Your eyes may be light-sensitive for several hours, so arrange for someone to take you home.
Management and Treatment
How are they treated?
Treatment depends on the eye and vision problems you develop as you age. Weak eyesight may mean using brighter lights or motion lights around your house or a magnifying device to read. Your specialist may recommend more frequent eye exams to monitor your condition.
Eyeglasses
,
contacts
, other vision aids or
vision correction surgery
can allow you to see better, improving your quality of life and independence. Eye drops, including
artificial tears
, or tear duct plugs may also help ease less serious symptoms.
What medications or procedures can treat severe eye problems?
For more severe age-related eye problems, your specialist may recommend:
Low-vision aids or rehabilitation therapy.
Medication (oral or injection).
Nutritional supplements, including AREDS2, a special dietary supplement designed to slow vision loss for people with intermediate or late age-related macular degeneration.
Eye surgery
for conditions like glaucoma, cataracts or retinal detachment.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have an age-related eye problem?
In many cases, your specialist can help you maintain or correct your vision. But some conditions, including glaucoma, cause damage that can’t be reversed. Talk to your provider about ways you can slow symptoms and adapt to the challenges of reduced vision. They can connect you with resources and other supports to help you continue living as well and independently as possible.
Prevention
How can I prevent age-related eye problems?
Comprehensive eye exams are the most important way to prevent eye problems and care for your eyes and vision, especially if you have underlying conditions like diabetes. Make regular appointments with your eye care specialist even if you don’t notice vision changes or have symptoms.
The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a complete eye exam with your ophthalmologist every year or so after age 50.
Ask your specialist how often you should have eye checkups.
An optician, who works with optometrists and ophthalmologists, can fit you with prescription glasses, dispense contacts or help you with other corrective vision aids. They can also adjust or replace existing glasses, lenses or frames. Consult your eye care specialist as your vision needs change.
