Addictive Substances
Substances are any type of medication or chemical that has addiction potential. Common examples include alcohol, cocaine, heroin and opioids. Substances target the reward center of your brain and can lead to substance use disorder and life-threatening outcomes if misused. Treatment is available if you need help with substance use or misuse.

addiction
potential. A substance addiction is a chronic condition that causes you to seek out and use substances despite harmful consequences.

Common substances include:
Alcohol
.
Caffeine
.
Cannabis (marijuana)
.
Hallucinogens
, like phencyclidine (PCP) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).
Hypnotics,
sedatives
and
anxiolytics
(anti-anxiety drugs), like
sleeping pills
,
benzodiazepines
and
barbiturates
.
Inhalants
, like paint thinners, aerosol sprays, gases and nitrites (poppers).
Prescription and nonprescription
opioids
, like

,

Prescription and nonprescription stimulants, like Adderall® (
amphetamine
/
dextroamphetamine
),
cocaine
and methamphetamine (meth).
Tobacco/nicotine, like smoking cigarettes and
electronic cigarettes
(e-cigarettes or vaping).
The term “substances” helps clarify that this group contains more than “street drugs” or prescription medications. There is a wide variety of substances available in different forms that could be habit-forming and pose a threat to your health if misused.
What are the most addictive substances?
Research
shows that some of the most addictive substances include:
Alcohol.
Cocaine.
Heroin.
Methamphetamine.
Nicotine.
Substances vary in how likely they are to lead to substance use disorder (SUD). The likelihood is called “addiction liability,” and it depends on multiple factors, including:

How you take the substance (for example, you might take them by mouth, by injection or by inhaling).
The rate at which the substance crosses the
blood-brain barrier
and triggers the reward pathway in your brain.
The time it takes to feel the effect of the substance.
The substance’s ability to create tolerance and/or withdrawal symptoms.
What are controlled substances?
Controlled substances are drugs or medications that have the potential to be misused and have a high risk of leading to substance use disorder.
In the United States, prescription medication controlled substances are strictly regulated under state and federal laws for their manufacturing and distribution. Examples of controlled prescription medications include
morphine
(severe pain reliever) and
methylphenidate
(stimulant).
Nonprescription controlled substances have state and federal laws regarding their possession and distribution. Examples of nonprescription controlled substances include methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and heroin.
Drug Schedules
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) put together five Schedules (categories or classifications) of controlled substances.
Schedule I
: These have the highest potential for misuse or risk of substance use disorder (SUD). Examples include heroin, LSD, MDMA and marijuana. Even though marijuana is legal in some states, it’s still considered a Schedule I drug at the federal level.
Schedule II
: These have a high risk for misuse and SUD. Examples include
fentanyl
, morphine, methamphetamine and oxycodone. Providers must follow strict regulations for prescription medication distribution (like no refills, for example).
Schedule III
: These substances have a lower risk of misuse but have some risk of SUD. Examples include
benzphetamine
,
ketamine
and
anabolic steroids
. Providers follow strict timeframe refill requirements for these prescription medications (five refills within six months, for example).
Schedule IV
: These have a lower risk of misuse and SUD than the first three Schedules. Examples include
clonazepam
,
diazepam
,
lorazepam
,
tramadol
and
triazolam
. Prescription refills are allowed but monitored closely.
Schedule V
: These are the least likely to cause misuse or SUD, but there’s still a risk. Examples include medicines with codeine, antidiarrheal medications that contain
atropine/diphenoxylate
and
pregabalin
. Providers will carefully watch and manage your treatment with these medications.
What are the effects of addictive substances?
When using a substance, the immediate effects are known as
intoxication
. Some common examples of substance intoxication effects include:
Mood changes (relaxed, sleepy, intensely happy, energetic, paranoid, etc.).
Hallucinations
.
Changes to your thinking and judgment.
Difficulty with coordination.
Increased or
decreased appetite
.
The exact thing you feel varies based on what substance you took, how much of the substance is in your body and if the substance is interacting with any other drugs or substances at the same time.
Substance withdrawal
After using a substance frequently, your body gets used to having it around all the time. Withdrawal happens when it leaves your body and the intoxication effects wear off.
Common withdrawal symptoms may include:
Agitation
.
Chills
.
Diarrhea
.
Difficulty sleeping.
Muscle aches.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Stomach cramps.
Sweating.
Withdrawal symptoms range in severity based on the type of substance and tolerance. For some substances, like opioids, the withdrawal symptoms are so severe that they create significant motivation to continue using them. This can make treating substance use disorder very difficult.
Substance effects on the brain
Substances affect the reward center of your
brain
. Humans are biologically motivated to seek rewards. Often, these rewards come from healthy behaviors. When you spend time with a loved one or eat a delicious meal, your body releases a chemical called
dopamine
, which makes you feel pleasure. It becomes a cycle — you seek out these experiences because they reward you with good feelings.

When you take a substance, a surge of dopamine happens in your brain. Because dopamine causes you to feel good, your brain and body want more of it. Such massive dopamine levels can lead to damaging changes that affect your thoughts, feelings and behavior. This can create an unhealthy drive to seek more pleasure from the substance and less from more healthy experiences.
Over time, the substances change your brain chemistry, and you become desensitized to their effects. You then need more of a substance to produce the same effect. This is known as tolerance. As you seek out more of a substance, it may lead to taking dangerously harmful doses or mixing substances that can be life-threatening complications like
overdose
.
What is the difference between substance use and substance use disorder?
Substance use and substance misuse refer to occasional episodes of substance use rather than a chronic, habitual or patterned use that is
substance use disorder
.
You may use substances occasionally without developing a SUD. But not everyone has the same opportunity. Even a few episodes of substance misuse can lead to tolerance and dependence (addiction).
Substance use disorder is treatable. Therapy and medications are available to help you manage this chronic condition when you’re ready.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Certain medications can help you relax after surgery if you’re in a lot of pain or manage an underlying chronic health condition. Some substances can even dust off your keyboard or keep a bouquet blooming.
However, substance misuse is common. It’s important to know more about the substances your provider prescribes or the products within your household. Keep them in a safe place and only use them only as directed.
If you think you or a loved one are at risk of a substance use disorder, have an honest conversation with a healthcare provider. They’re available to help when you’re ready.
