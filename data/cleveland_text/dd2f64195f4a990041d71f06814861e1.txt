nutritionist
.

How could a dietitian help me?
If you ever need hospital care, a registered dietitian might be an important part of your healthcare team. Whether you’re recovering from surgery or critical illness, you’ll need specific nutrition to support you. An RD determines your needs and figures out how you need to get nutrients, either by mouth,
by tube
or
through an IV
.
You might choose to visit a dietitian on your own to help you develop a nutrition plan. Maybe you have a health condition that requires you to change your eating habits, and you’re not sure where to start. Or you might want professional advice on how best to lose weight or gain weight or enhance your physical performance.

Additional Common Questions
How do you become a registered dietitian?
You must earn a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree from an accredited program. After that, you’ll need to complete at least 1,000 hours of supervised practice before you can take the national exam to earn your RD or RDN credentials. Some states also require a license to practice in that state.
What is a registered dietetic technician?
Nutrition and dietetics technician, registered (NDTR) is an alternative credential you can earn from the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR). NDTRs support registered dietitians. They help evaluate people’s nutrition needs, educate people about food choices and monitor their progress.
What is a certified nutrition specialist?
A certified nutrition specialist (CNS) has an advanced degree (a master’s or doctorate) in nutrition. Like dietitians, CNSs earn their credentials through a combination of coursework, supervised practice and passing a certifying exam.
While a CNS has similar knowledge and skills as a registered dietitian (RD), the CNS title isn’t as widely recognized. Some states allow CNSs to provide medical nutrition therapy, but others don’t.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Nutrition is important for everyone, everywhere. Dietitians use their training to help people eat healthy. They sometimes work directly with you, but other times, they’re behind the scenes. Either way, they play a critical role in helping people get the nutrients they need to lead a healthy lifestyle.
