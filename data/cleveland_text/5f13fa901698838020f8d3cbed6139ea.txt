Esophageal Web
Esophageal webs are thin membranes that grow across the upper part of your esophagus. They often occur alongside conditions like GERD and iron-deficiency anemia. Esophageal webs cause narrowing, making it difficult to swallow. The standard treatment is esophageal dilation. But if the webbing doesn’t cause symptoms, you don’t need treatment.

Overview
What is an esophageal web?
An esophageal web is a thin membrane that grows across the inside of your upper
esophagus
. Most people don’t know they have esophageal webs because they don’t usually cause symptoms. But in severe cases, this web of tissue may partially or completely block your esophagus, making it
difficult to swallow
.

Most people with this condition only have one “web,” but it’s possible to have more. There’s also a chance the webbing could come back (recur) after treatment, though it’s rare.
Esophageal webs occur most often in people with severe, untreated
iron-deficiency anemia
. It also happens in people with
Plummer-Vinson syndrome
— a condition with three hallmark symptoms, including iron-deficiency anemia, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and webbing.
How common are esophageal webs?
It’s hard to say exactly how many people have esophageal webs because they typically don’t cause symptoms. Healthcare providers usually detect esophageal webbing during tests for unrelated reasons.
About
5% to 15%
of people who see their healthcare provider for dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) have esophageal webs.
Esophageal web vs. ring
Esophageal webs are similar to esophageal rings (
Schatzki rings
). Both conditions cause your esophagus to narrow and may interfere with swallowing. The difference is where they occur: Webs form in your upper esophagus, and rings form in your lower esophagus. Webs and rings are types of
esophageal strictures
(narrowed areas in your esophagus).
Some people are born with esophageal webs and rings. But most of the time, they develop later alongside other conditions. Esophageal webs and rings don’t cause issues most of the time. But if they make swallowing painful, treatment can help.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of esophageal webs?
Most people with esophageal webs don’t have symptoms. If you don’t have symptoms, you probably don’t need treatment.
Difficulty swallowing foods and liquids is the most common symptom of esophageal webs. Sometimes, food can even get caught. When this happens, it may feel
painful
or like there’s something
stuck in your throat
.
If you have webbing associated with Plummer-Vinson syndrome, symptoms may include a
sore tongue
and
cracks in the corners of your mouth
.
What causes esophageal webs?
Experts don’t know exactly what causes esophageal webs. If you were born with the condition, it might be due to how your esophagus formed during
fetal development
. If you acquired it later in life, it could be a byproduct of another condition.
Esophageal web risk factors
Esophageal webs tend to occur most often in people with:
Autoimmune thyroid diseases (like
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
and
Graves’ disease
)
Blistering skin diseases (like
pemphigus
)
Celiac disease
Chronic acid reflux/GERD
Graft vs. host disease
Iron-deficiency anemia
Psoriasis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Diagnosis and Tests
How are esophageal webs diagnosed?
Healthcare providers use these tests to diagnose esophageal webs:
Esophagram (barium swallow test)
. This imaging test captures video of what happens when you swallow. It can tell your provider if you have an esophageal web or another type of stricture.
Upper endoscopy
. A provider uses a scope to look at the inside lining of your esophagus. If you have an esophageal web, your provider will be able to see it during this test.
Management and Treatment
How are esophageal webs treated?
Treating underlying conditions may get rid of esophageal webbing. Healthcare providers use medications, in-office treatments and surgery. They’ll tailor a care plan to your specific needs.
Medications
For example, if you have iron-deficiency anemia, you’ll need
iron supplements
or
infusions
. If you have GERD, you’ll need reflux medication like
H2 blockers
or
proton pump inhibitors
.
These treatments might be enough to change your esophageal structure and ease your symptoms.
In-office treatments
If medications don’t work, your healthcare provider might recommend
esophageal dilation
. Healthcare providers do this during an upper endoscopy. They’ll use a surgical balloon or a series of surgical dilators to stretch the narrowed section of your esophagus.
Surgery
Most people with webbing won’t need surgery. But if you have severe esophageal webbing, you might need
electrocauterization
to remove the affected tissue. This process uses heat to cut away the webbing.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for people with esophageal webs?
The outlook is excellent with treatment. For most people, symptoms go away after esophageal dilation. But some people might need repeat dilations in severe cases because there’s a small chance the webbing could come back.
Prevention
Can esophageal webs be prevented?
You can’t prevent esophageal webs. But you might be able to reduce your risk by managing related conditions like iron-deficiency anemia and acid reflux.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Tell your healthcare provider any time you have symptoms of esophageal webs, like trouble swallowing. They’ll need to find a cause so they can recommend appropriate treatment.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you have an esophageal web, here are some questions you might want to ask your healthcare provider:
Do I need treatment?
What kind of treatment do you recommend?
Do I have any underlying conditions associated with esophageal webs?
Will I need to take medication?
Are there things I can do to reduce my symptoms?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Swallowing shouldn’t be painful or difficult. If it is, it could mean something is going on. Esophageal webs aren’t dangerous. But if they cause symptoms, it’s time to talk with a healthcare provider. They’ll diagnose any underlying conditions and recommend a treatment plan that’s right for you.
