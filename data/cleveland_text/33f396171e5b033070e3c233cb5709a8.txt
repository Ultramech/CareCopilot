Additional Common Questions
Athletic trainers vs. personal trainers
People sometimes confuse athletic trainers with personal trainers. A
personal trainer
is mainly a fitness consultant. They offer personalized exercise plans and advice. But they don’t diagnose or treat injuries.
A personal trainer isn’t a healthcare provider. Some earn certifications. But they aren’t licensed or regulated by states.
Athletic trainers vs. sports medicine physicians
Athletic trainers and a
sports medicine physicians
are different kinds of healthcare providers. Athletic trainers aren’t doctors. They don’t go to medical school. But they’re required to have college degrees and board certification. Athletic trainers work with sports medicine doctors as part of your care team.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
You don’t need to be a professional all-star athlete to work with an athletic trainer. Some do work on the sidelines for pro teams. But a trainer can help any type of athlete stay safe before, during and after physical activities. A trainer can help you prevent injuries before they happen. They might also work with you after an injury to get you back on the court, field or ice.
