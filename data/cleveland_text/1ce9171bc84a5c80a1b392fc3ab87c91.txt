Vacuum Extraction Delivery
Vacuum extraction is one kind of assisted delivery procedure that can help get your baby through the birth canal when labor is stalled in the second stage. The vacuum extractor applies suction and traction to the baby’s head to help pull it out while you push. Vacuum extraction is only recommended under certain conditions.

Overview
A vacuum extraction helps deliver your baby. It uses a suction cup to apply traction to your baby’s head.
What is vacuum extraction delivery?
Vacuum extraction (or vacuum-assisted delivery) is one way
obstetricians
can assist with the delivery of your baby while you’re pushing. During the pushing stage of
labor
, sometimes things slow down. You’re pushing, but your baby isn’t coming out. This can last for hours without much progress. While you’re in labor, your healthcare team will monitor your
vital signs
and your
baby’s heart rate
for signs of
fetal distress
. If you or your baby’s health is in danger or labor isn’t progressing, your healthcare team may look for other
ways to deliver your baby
.

Policy
Vacuum extraction is one such option. The vacuum extractor consists of a suction cup attached to a pump. The cup is applied to your baby’s head while the pump provides traction to pull while you push.
In the United States, vacuum extraction accounts for about
3%
of
vaginal births
.
Treatment Details
What are the indications for vacuum extraction delivery?
Your healthcare team may suggest vacuum extraction if:
You’ve been pushing for a long time, but the baby isn’t coming out
Your baby’s
heart rate
isn’t within the normal range (110 to 160 beats per minute)
You’re too tired or have a health problem that keeps you from pushing
What can we try first?
Before using a vacuum, your healthcare team may try to:
Help you change positions
Give you
oxygen
through a mask
Give you fluids through an IV
If these steps don’t help, your healthcare team may recommend an assisted delivery method like vacuum extraction or
forceps delivery
.
What are the contraindications?
Sometimes, you might need assistance, but vacuum extraction isn’t the right choice. This might be true if your baby:
Is
premature
Is
breech
Hasn’t moved down low enough in the birth canal
Might be too big to fit through the birth canal
Has a
bleeding disorder
How does a vacuum extraction work?
Your pregnancy care provider will explain the risks and benefits and ask for your
consent
before starting. If needed, they’ll give you
pain relief
. Sometimes, they may also need to cut the area between your vagina and anus (called an
episiotomy
) or break your water.

Your provider will place the suction cup on your baby’s head. When your next contraction starts, they’ll gently pull while you push. The suction adds extra help to get your baby out. Once your baby’s head is out, they remove the cup. Then, your provider helps guide the rest of your baby’s body out with their hands.
When should attempted vacuum extraction be abandoned?
Your providers will stop using the vacuum extractor if any of the following are true:
It’s been attempted and was unsuccessful
The cup has unintentionally detached from your baby’s head three times
There’s any sign of trauma to your baby’s scalp
What happens after this procedure?
Once your baby has been completely delivered, your healthcare team will check you and your baby for any signs of wounding from the procedure. If you had a
tear
or an episiotomy, they’ll repair it for you. They’ll continue to monitor your baby for any signs of complications that might arise.
If vacuum extraction is unsuccessful, your healthcare team may recommend a
C-section
next.
What are the potential benefits and risks of vacuum extraction?
Vacuum extraction can help deliver your baby without putting you through surgery. It’s also faster than surgery, which is sometimes very important.
Risks to the mother from vacuum-assisted delivery are similar to the risks of childbirth, in general. They include:
Vaginal tears
Postpartum bleeding
Difficulty peeing or
incontinence
Short-term side effects of vacuum extraction for the baby can include:
Caput succedaneum
.
This is when your baby’s scalp swells into a cone-like shape. It gets better in a few days.
Bruising / jaundice
.
The vacuum extractor can cause bruising of the scalp, which increases your baby’s risk of
jaundice
. This condition produces a temporary yellowing of your baby’s skin. It usually goes away in a few weeks.
Cephalohematoma
.
This is a collection of blood between your baby’s scalp and skull, caused by damaged blood vessels. It doesn’t affect their brain and typically heals in one or two weeks.
Serious complications for your baby are rare. They can include:
Skull fracture
.
Newborn skulls are soft and can easily get injured. Most fractures are small, heal on their own and cause no long-term damage. More severe fractures can cause brain bleeding.
Intracranial hemorrhage
.
This is bleeding either in or around the brain. Brain bleeds are rare but can be serious. Less commonly, the bleeding can put pressure on the brain, causing brain damage.
Subgaleal hemorrhage
. This occurs when the emissary
veins
in your baby’s head are ruptured, and blood accumulates within the connective tissue between their skull and scalp. Typically, it gradually develops during the days after delivery.

Recovery and Outlook
How long does it take to recover from a vacuum-assisted delivery?
If there are no complications, you’ll recover in about six weeks (typical recovery time for a vaginal delivery).
If your baby has any of the common short-term side effects of vacuum delivery, such as bruising, jaundice or scalp swelling, these will improve over the next few weeks. Take extra care to protect your baby’s head while it heals, and make sure to bring them in for follow-up checkups with their
pediatrician
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Many parents hope and plan for a simple vaginal birth, but childbirth can have its twists and turns. When difficulties arise, it’s good to know the options available to you. Vacuum extraction is one tool that you and your healthcare provider might choose to help deliver your baby.
As you plan for delivery, you can discuss interventions like vacuum extraction with your healthcare provider in advance. They’ll help you understand the risks and benefits, and make a plan for how to proceed if you need help delivering your baby.
