Many common endocrine conditions are lifelong (chronic). So, you may see an endocrinologist throughout your life. They’re experts in their field and can help you manage the condition to lead a healthy life.
What is endocrinology?
Endocrinology is the study of hormones and endocrine glands and organs. This is your endocrine system.
Hormones help parts of your body communicate with other parts. Your body makes over 50 different hormones. They have a large role in many bodily functions, like:
Metabolism
Growth
Sexual function and reproduction
Sleep
Endocrine glands release hormones, like your
thyroid
and
pituitary gland
. Certain
organs
in your body also release hormones, like your
pancreas
and
ovaries
.
What do endocrinologists do?
Endocrinologists diagnose and provide treatment plans for endocrine conditions. Some of the roles of an endocrinologist include:
Recommending and interpreting lab tests, like
blood tests
, to diagnose or monitor conditions
Recommending imaging tests to check endocrine glands and organs
Doing and interpreting
bone mineral density tests
Doing
fine-needle aspiration biopsies
of your thyroid
Recommending treatment plans, which may include medication and/or surgery
Prescribing medications
Monitoring your management plan over time if you have a chronic condition

cancers
and
tumors

When should I see an endocrinologist?
Primary care physicians
(PCPs) can diagnose and help manage many endocrine conditions. But you may benefit from seeing an endocrinologist. They’re likely more knowledgeable on the condition and more current on the medications and technology that can help treat it.
You can think of it like taking your vehicle to get fixed. You may want to take it to a repair shop that specializes in your vehicle’s brand instead of a general repair shop.
If your PCP thinks you have
hormonal imbalances
, they may refer you to an endocrinologist for a proper diagnosis. An endocrinologist could also be part of a healthcare team to treat certain conditions, like cancers and fertility issues.
What should I expect when seeing an endocrinologist?
You’ll most likely see an endocrinologist during an outpatient visit to their office. They’ll ask thorough questions about your medical history, current medications and symptoms. They may also do a
physical exam
.
What do endocrinologists specialize in?
An endocrinologist may specialize in certain areas of endocrinology called subspecialties, including:
Diabetes and metabolism
Endocrinology nuclear medicine (using
nuclear medicine
to diagnose and treat certain endocrine conditions)
Endocrine
oncology
(cancers that affect your endocrine system)
Metabolic bone disease and calcium disorders
Neuroendocrinology (the interaction between your
nervous system
and endocrine system)
Pediatric endocrinology
Thyroid disease
You may also hear about reproductive endocrinologists. This is a subspecialty of
obstetrics
and
gynecology
. These providers specialize in
female infertility
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Getting a new diagnosis can be overwhelming. If you have a condition that affects your hormones, like diabetes or thyroid disease, an endocrinologist can help you manage it. They’re experts in their field and have up-to-date knowledge on treatment strategies. If you have a chronic condition, it’s important to find an endocrinologist you trust. You’ll rely on them for the long haul.
