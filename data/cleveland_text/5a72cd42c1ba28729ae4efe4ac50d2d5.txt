Amenorrhea
Amenorrhea is missing one or more periods. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re older than 15 and haven’t gotten your first period (primary amenorrhea) or you’ve missed a period for three or more months (secondary amenorrhea). Amenorrhea is often a sign of a treatable condition. With treatment, your regular menstrual cycle will usually resume.

How does menstruation work?
A complex system of hormones controls your menstrual cycle. Every cycle, these hormones prepare your uterus for a possible pregnancy. If there’s no pregnancy that cycle, you shed your uterine lining. That shedding is your period. There are many factors that can affect your period including issues with the following organs and structures:
Hypothalamus
: Controls your pituitary gland, which affects
ovulation
(releasing an egg).
Ovaries
: Store and produce the egg for ovulation and the hormones
estrogen
and
progesterone
.
Uterus
: Responds to the hormones by thickening your uterine lining. This lining sheds as your menstrual period if there’s no pregnancy.
What are the types of amenorrhea?
Primary amenorrhea
Primary amenorrhea is when you haven’t gotten your first period by age 15 or within five years of the first signs of
puberty
(such as developing breasts). It’s usually due to
genetic conditions
(conditions you’re born with) or acquired abnormalities (conditions that develop after birth).
Secondary amenorrhea
Secondary amenorrhea is when you’ve been getting regular periods, but you stop getting your period for at least three months, or your period stops for six months when they were previously irregular. Common reasons for this type of amenorrhea include:

pelvic exam
.

Ultrasound
, if your provider suspects an issue with your ovaries or uterus.
Should I keep track of my periods?
Diagnosing amenorrhea can be challenging. If the cause of amenorrhea isn’t obvious, such as pregnancy or menopause, your provider may ask you to keep a record of changes in your menstrual cycle. This history of your periods can help your provider figure out a diagnosis.

Following a diet and exercise plan that help you maintain a weight that’s healthy for you.
Stress management techniques.
Changing exercise levels.
Hormonal treatment (medication), as prescribed by your healthcare provider.

to relieve hot flashes and
vaginal dryness
.
Calcium and vitamin D supplements
to keep bones strong.
Strength training (lifting weights or doing movements to strengthen your muscles).
Will I need surgery for amenorrhea?
Surgery for amenorrhea is rare. Your healthcare provider may recommend it if you have:
A physical difference that prevents vaginal bleeding like a
vaginal septum
or
imperforate hymen
.
Pituitary tumor.
Uterine scar tissue.
How long does amenorrhea last?
Most cases of amenorrhea are treatable. With treatment, your periods should start to happen regularly. It can take a few months for your periods to come back, but in most cases, they will. Talk to your healthcare provider about what you can expect with treatment.

Outlook / Prognosis
Will my period return?
Typically, your period will return once you treat the underlying cause. However, it may take time to become regular again.

Follow a diet and exercise plan that’s healthy for you.
Be aware of your menstrual cycle (so you’ll know if you miss a period).

Pap test
.
Get regular and adequate sleep.

When should I see my healthcare provider about amenorrhea?

vision
(these symptoms might indicate a more serious condition).
Produce breast milk when you haven’t given birth.

What are my treatment options, and what are the risks and benefits to each?
Do I need to see an endocrinologist for hormonal treatments?

Once my period returns, can I get amenorrhea again?
Additional Common Questions
Is it normal to have amenorrhea after stopping the pill?
Yes, some people notice they don’t get their period after stopping birth control pills (post-pill amenorrhea). This is because your body is trying to remember how to produce the hormones necessary for ovulation and menstruation. It can take up to three months for your body to resume menstruation. Talk to your healthcare provider if you go longer than four to six months without a period after stopping the pill.
Is amenorrhea a type of infertility?
No, amenorrhea isn’t a form of infertility. However, not getting a menstrual period can lead to not being able to get pregnant. If having a child is your goal and your menstrual cycle is irregular or absent, contact your healthcare provider for an appointment.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re older than 15 and haven’t gotten your period or you’ve had a normal menstrual cycle but now you’re missing periods. Amenorrhea is usually the sign of a treatable condition. Once your provider figures out what’s causing missed periods, you can get care to regulate your cycle. You may need lifestyle changes or hormonal treatment to help resume normal menstrual cycles.
