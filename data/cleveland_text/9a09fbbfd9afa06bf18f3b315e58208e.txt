Intoxication
Intoxication happens after you consume alcohol or other substances that affect how your brain works. It affects elements like your mental capabilities, mood and coordination. By definition, intoxication is temporary and doesn’t necessarily harm your health. It’s different from poisonings or overdoses, which are life-threatening.

. It results in changes in your:

Level of consciousness.
Mental abilities (cognition).
Perception.
Mood.
Behavior.
Coordination.
Intoxication is generally a short-term phenomenon. But how long it lasts can vary based on several factors, like:
How much of the substance you take or consume.
If you take or consume more than one substance.
Your body composition.
Your age.
Your overall health.
The intensity and effects of intoxication wear off with time. They go away completely when you stop using the substance.
Mild to moderate intoxication itself typically doesn’t require medical attention. But it can lead to certain issues (like violent behavior) or injuries (like falls), which may need medical treatment. Healthcare providers consider severe intoxication of a substance to be
poisoning
or overdose (like
alcohol poisoning
or
opioid overdose
). Poisonings and overdoses are life-threatening.
What substances cause intoxication?
Any substance that causes mind-altering effects can lead to intoxication. This includes things like:
Schedule I drugs (like heroin and LSD).
Prescription medications, especially schedule II, III, IV and V drugs.
Certain over-the-counter medications, like cough syrups.
Certain cleaning products, like bleach fumes.
Certain household products, like paint thinners and glues.

Specific examples of substances that can cause intoxication include:
Alcohol.
Benzodiazepines (benzos)
.
Cannabis (marijuana)
.
Dextromethorphan
(a cough suppressant).
Opioids
.
Hallucinogens
.
Inhalants
.
Nicotine
.
Stimulants, like
cocaine
and
methylphenidate
(Ritalin®).
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of intoxication?
The symptoms of intoxication vary based on the substance(s) and how much of it/them you take or consume. Intoxication affects how your
nervous system
functions. So, it can cause both physical symptoms and mental/behavioral symptoms.
Mental and behavioral symptoms of intoxication may include:
Aggression.
Agitation.
Anxiety.
Decreased levels of consciousness, like drowsiness or
lethargy
.
Euphoria.
Hallucinations
.
Impaired judgment.
Inattention or difficulty focusing.
Increased energy or hyperactivity.
Memory issues
.
Mood swings
(mood lability).
Paranoia
.
Risk-taking behaviors.
Physical symptoms of intoxication may include:
Balance
and coordination issues.
Blurred vision
.
Body temperature changes (
hyperthermia
or
hypothermia
).
Constricted
or
dilated pupils
.
Flushed face.
Heart rate changes, like
tachycardia
.
High
or
low blood pressure
.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Slurred speech (
dysarthria
).
These symptoms can range from mild to severe. Being intoxicated from more than one substance creates more unpredictable symptoms. It’s usually more dangerous. If someone near you who’s intoxicated loses consciousness, has breathing problems or otherwise can’t function, get medical help immediately.
What causes intoxication?
In general, intoxication happens because substances interfere with how your
brain
works. More specifically, substances affect how
nerve
cells (neurons) send, receive and process signals via
neurotransmitters
(chemical messengers).
Humans have at least 100 types of neurotransmitters. They play a lot of different roles in your nervous system, especially in your brain. For example, monoamine neurotransmitters (like
serotonin
and
dopamine
) regulate consciousness, cognition, attention and emotion.
Each substance affects how your brain uses specific neurotransmitters in different ways. That’s why each substance has characteristic intoxication symptoms.
Intoxication can be intentional or accidental. For example, many people drink alcohol to experience its intoxicating effects. And children may accidentally consume a substance and experience intoxication.
What are the complications of intoxication?
Mild to moderate intoxication itself typically isn’t harmful to your health. But the effects of intoxication (like coordination issues and impaired judgment) can lead to issues, like:
Injuries
: People experiencing intoxication are more likely to accidentally injure themselves or someone else. Intoxication that causes extreme aggression can lead to acts of violence.
Worsening underlying health conditions
: Intoxication from certain substances can worsen underlying health conditions, like
heart issues
or
mental health conditions
.
Risk of
addiction
and
substance use disorder
: Use or misuse of any substance can lead to addiction or substance use disorder. The intoxicating effect of euphoria is one key factor that contributes to addiction.
Work and relationship issues
: The cognitive and behavior changes involved with intoxication can affect your ability to do your job and negatively affect your relationships with others.
Legal issues
: Intoxication has legal consequences in certain situations, like driving under the influence (DUI). And certain states in the U.S. have public intoxication laws. Intoxication can also make you uninhibited and have impaired judgment, which may make it more likely that you’ll break a law.

It’s important to get professional help if intoxication is affecting your life or you’re concerned about developing a substance use disorder. Talk to a healthcare provider or call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) at 1.800.662.4357. Someone will be available to help.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is intoxication diagnosed?
There typically isn’t a need to diagnose intoxication. But if you go to the emergency room for another issue while intoxicated or are experiencing accidental intoxication, a healthcare provider will want to know what’s in your system.
Providers can order various tests, like
blood
and
urine (pee) tests
, to check for substances in your system. For example, they may order
blood alcohol level (BAL)
tests or
drug tests
.
It’s important to be honest about your substance use if you’re in the hospital while intoxicated. The symptoms of intoxication overlap with several other medical conditions. So, being honest will help your provider rule out other issues and give you the best care.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for intoxication?
By definition, the combination of time and stopping the use of the substance is the main way to “treat” intoxication. How long this takes can vary. Intoxication usually doesn’t require medical attention unless it leads to injuries or medical complications.

When should I see my healthcare provider about intoxication?
If you’re concerned about developing a substance use disorder, talk to your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can connect you with resources to get treatment that’s right for you.

Have a serious injury, like a head injury or
broken bone

suicidal behavior
or thoughts of harming others.

Prevention
How can I prevent accidental intoxication?
Some steps you can take to avoid accidental intoxication include:
Take your medications as prescribed
: Your healthcare provider carefully considers your dose so that it’s medically helpful and not intoxicating. Don’t ever take more than instructed. If you have issues remembering if you’ve taken your medication, keep notes or use a smartphone app to track it.
Keep medications and substances away from children
: Safely store medications, cleaning supplies and substances away from children (and pets). Even a small amount can lead to intoxication in children.
Socialize safely
: If you plan to drink socially, take certain safety precautions. For example,
never leave your drink unattended
and don’t accept drinks or food from other people. If you feel “off” or unsafe, tell a trusted loved one immediately and get help.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
The state of intoxication is the blurry in-between of your normal functioning and substance poisoning or overdose. Some people choose to experience intoxication. But it can also happen accidentally. Always practice safety precautions when using substances and know your limits. If you’re concerned about addiction or think you may have overdone it, get medical help as soon as possible.
