Tooth Scaling and Root Planing
Scaling and root planing is a deep dental cleaning. It removes tartar and bacteria that build up around the roots of your teeth. Dentists and periodontists may deep clean your teeth if you have mild or moderate gum disease. This treatment can help sore, bleeding gums, prevent tooth loss and give you the best chance for long-lasting oral health.

gums

You might need a deep dental cleaning if you have
periodontitis
. Symptoms of periodontitis include swollen or
bleeding gums
. Tooth scaling removes plaque and tartar above the gumline. Root planing smooths your teeth roots and removes plaque and tartar below your gumline. Together, tooth scaling and root planing can get rid of disease-causing bacteria and improve your overall oral health.

Dental hygienists
Dentists
Periodontists

gum disease

Treatment Details
What happens during a deep dental cleaning?
When you go in for tooth scaling and root planing, your dentist or hygienist will:
Give you local
anesthesia
to numb your gums
Remove (scale)
plaque
and
tartar
from your
teeth
(both above and below your gums)
Smooth (plane) your teeth roots
Your provider will use hand scalers or ultrasonic instruments to deep clean your teeth. They may also inject
antibiotics
around your teeth roots or prescribe oral antibiotics for you to take after the procedure.
A deep dental cleaning takes one to two hours to complete. Your dentist might do everything in one visit. Or they might clean half your teeth during one appointment and the other half during a second one. It all depends on your situation and preferences and your dental insurance plan.

How often will I need scaling and root planing done?
Ideally, you’ll need scaling and root planing only once. After your dentist removes the tartar and bacteria, regular
dental cleanings
and good
oral hygiene
should help keep you on track. The goal is to improve the health of your gums so you won’t need another deep cleaning.

Risks / Benefits
What are the potential benefits of this treatment?
A dental deep cleaning can:
Get rid of bad breath
. Scaling and root planing gets rid of the oral bacteria that cause
halitosis
.
Improve your oral and overall health
. Bacteria in your
mouth
can travel through your bloodstream to other parts of your body. A deep dental cleaning reduces harmful bacteria, improving whole-body health.
Prevent
tooth loss
and
gum recession
. You can avoid these gum disease symptoms by getting treatment early.
Reduce your risk for advanced gum disease
. The longer you wait to get treatment, the more bacteria may grow.
What are the risks or complications of a deep dental cleaning?
Complications are rare, but they can happen. Potential risks include:
Bleeding
. It’s normal to have some bleeding after a deep dental cleaning. But let your dentist know if you have
excessive bleeding that doesn’t stop
.
Gum recession
. If your gums were swollen before your deep cleaning, they’ll shrink back once the infection is gone. As a result, you might see a little bit more of your teeth roots.
Infection
. Your dentist may prescribe antibiotics to reduce this risk.
Loose teeth
. Your teeth might feel a little wiggly right after your deep cleaning. This should go away once your gums tighten back up.
Teeth sensitivity
. Removing the plaque and tartar from your teeth can make them more sensitive to heat and cold. If you notice this side effect, it should go away in a month or two.
Tenderness
. Your gums might feel a bit sore for a couple of days. You can take over-the-counter
pain relievers
to manage any discomfort.
Recovery and Outlook
How long does it take to recover from scaling and root planing?
It can vary, but most people can return to their normal routines the same day. Scaling and root planing is much less invasive than other
gum disease treatments
. You won’t need incisions or stitches, and you can eat and drink whatever you like as long as it doesn’t hurt.
Your dentist will give you a list of instructions specific to your situation. Following their guidelines will help you recover quickly. Be sure to ask questions beforehand if something isn’t clear.
When To Call the Doctor

Additional Common Questions
Is a deep dental cleaning ever really necessary?
Yes, a deep dental cleaning is the only way to remove plaque and bacteria deep under your gums. While brushing and flossing is always a good thing, your toothbrush can’t reach all the way down to your teeth roots. You need both professional cleanings and good habits at home to maintain healthy teeth and gums.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
As an adult, you only have one set of teeth. No one wants to risk losing them to advanced gum disease. Thankfully, tooth scaling and root planing can save your smile if you develop periodontitis.
Only a dental professional has the necessary tools and expertise to remove the tartar that causes periodontal disease. But daily brushing and flossing can keep your teeth and gums healthy. To lower your chances of another bout of gum disease, ask your provider to show you how to properly brush, floss and take care of your teeth.
