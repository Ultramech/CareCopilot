Neurotypical
There’s no such thing as “normal” when it comes to the human brain. That’s because brains are infinitely complex, and no two brains can ever develop and work exactly the same. Instead, experts looked for patterns in how brains work. Being neurotypical means your brain developed and works like the brains of most people.

What is Neurotypical?
“Neurotypical” is a nonmedical term that describes people whose
brains
develop and work like most people’s brains do. Neurotypical people make up most of the world’s population — about 80% to 85%.

Neurotypical people generally have brains that operate at about the same level across different types of skills. Some of the skill areas include things like memory, math, and written or spoken language.
There’s nothing right or wrong about being neurotypical or
neurodivergent
. Neither one is good, bad or better than the other. Being one or the other is just a trait, like your hair color or complexion.
Why ‘normal’ doesn’t fit
No two brains are exactly alike. The average human brain consists of around 86 billion neurons. Those are cells that communicate with electrical and chemical signals. When a connection forms between neurons, that’s called a synapse (pronounced “SIN-aps” or “sin-APS”). Your brain has trillions of synapses. The network of synapses your brain creates is 100% unique. The layout of that network is what makes you who you are.
Because each brain is unique, that means there’s no such thing as “normal.” Instead, the approach becomes about looking for patterns in how brains work. Neurotypical is just the term for having a brain that develops and works like most humans’ brains.
Being neurotypical means you’re less likely to face issues that neurodivergent people face. Examples include:
Fitting in
. You fit in without needing to pretend to be like everyone else (a technique called
masking
). You don’t have to worry about being shunned or questioned by others just for being the way you are.
School and education
. Classes and school activities are mainly designed for neurotypical people. Staying focused, on task and following instructions isn’t difficult for you.
Sensory processing
. You don’t have trouble with what your senses are telling you. You can ignore or tune out unpleasant textures, smells or sounds. You don’t get overwhelmed or overstimulated in hectic environments.
Social interactions
. Social encounters usually involve a lot of unspoken rules or expectations. You tend to find socializing easier and don’t have trouble with those rules and expectations.

Is being neurotypical a lifelong trait?
Not necessarily. There are many ways someone born neurotypical might develop neurodivergence. When this happens, it’s called “acquired neurodivergence.”
Acquired neurodivergence means that at some point, something changed in your brain and now it works differently. That’s not automatically a bad thing. It’s simply a difference.
Many instances of acquired neurodivergence happen after some kind of injury or traumatic event. These types of acquired neurodivergence are sometimes — but not always — temporary. Some examples of conditions or events that can cause acquired neurodivergence include:
Age-related brain disorders
.
Degenerative brain diseases
like
Alzheimer’s disease
permanently change the way your brain works.
Concussions
and
traumatic brain injuries (TBIs)
. An example would be having trouble with your memory — either temporarily or permanently — after a
head injury
.
Mental health conditions or events
.
Mood disorders
like
depression
and
anxiety
can shift the way your brain works. The same is true of conditions that your brain develops as a survival response to extreme events. An example would be
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
.
But acquired neurodivergence can also happen in other ways. In fact,
one study
found multiple instances of neurotypical people developing neurodivergent traits. Several of those instances happened spontaneously or from seemingly ordinary events. But acquired neurodivergence that happens this way is very rare.
Can neurotypical people have neurodivergent children?
Yes, neurotypical people can have neurodivergent children. And conversely, neurodivergent people can have neurotypical children.
Genetics do affect a person’s odds of being neurodivergent. Conditions like
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
and
autism
can run in families. But experts still don’t fully understand how and why these conditions affect some people. And there are other factors that can contribute, so inheriting these conditions isn’t a guarantee.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
When it comes to neurotypical and neurodivergent, it’s not a question of normal and abnormal or good and bad. It’s just a difference. Being one way or the other is part of who you are, but it doesn’t define you.
If you're neurotypical, your brain works differently from a neurodivergent person’s. But you still share some common ground. You’re both people, and you both mainly want the same things: healthy and happy lives. And expanding support to neurodivergent people benefits everyone, neurotypical and neurodivergent alike.
