Estriol
When you’re pregnant, you make high levels of estriol, an estrogen hormone. This hormone helps your uterus grow and stay healthy. It also prepares your body for childbirth and breastfeeding. Estriol levels that are too high or low may indicate a problem with the fetus or pregnancy. Providers may also use estriol as a hormone therapy to ease menopause symptoms.

Overview
What is estriol?
Estriol is one of three
estrogen
hormones. Estriol levels rise throughout
pregnancy
, helping to keep the fetus and your
uterus
healthy. The levels are at their highest right before childbirth.

Everyone makes estriol. But in people who aren’t pregnant, the levels are almost undetectable. Other names for estriol include oestriol and E3.

Function
What does estriol do?
Unlike other estrogen hormones, estriol only has a significant role in pregnancy. During pregnancy, estriol:
Helps your uterus grow as the fetus gets bigger
Makes your body more sensitive to other pregnancy
hormones
Prepares your body for
labor and delivery
and
breastfeeding
Estriol levels start to rise around the eighth week of pregnancy. They continue to increase throughout pregnancy. Estriol levels are at their highest about three weeks before you give birth. Some researchers believe that rising estriol levels may play a role in preparing your body for labor. But they don’t fully understand this connection.
Estriol as medication
There’s also a laboratory-made form of estriol (a
bioidentical hormone
). Healthcare providers may prescribe it as part of
hormone therapy for menopause
.
The use of this medication for the treatment of menopausal symptoms isn’t FDA-approved in the United States. It’s usually only available at compounding pharmacies. Please consult your healthcare provider before using compounded estriol.
Researchers are exploring the many possible functions of estriol. Lab-made estriol may also:

Improve brain (cognitive) function
Relieve
menstrual migraines
Smooth
wrinkles
Treat
nervous system
disorders that cause
inflammation
, like
multiple sclerosis
(MS)
Treat
postpartum depression
These uses are considered off-label and are still being researched. Please talk to your provider before using estriol for any of these purposes.
Anatomy
Where does estriol come from?
The
placenta
is mainly in charge of making estriol. But there are a few steps to the process:
The fetus’s
adrenal glands
make a hormone called
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS)
.
The fetus’s
liver
changes DHEAS into another chemical called 16a-hydroxy-DHEAS.
This chemical travels to the placenta, where it changes into estriol.
Estriol then enters your bloodstream.
Conditions and Disorders
When do healthcare providers measure estriol levels?
Providers typically test estriol levels between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy (during the
second trimester
). This prenatal test is part of a triple marker or
quad marker screening
that helps detect congenital conditions (
birth defects
).
A quad marker screening test measures the hormones estriol and
human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
. It also measures
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
and inhibin-A proteins.
Your provider may order an estriol blood test or a quad screen if you have risk factors for congenital conditions, like:
Being age 35 or older (
advanced maternal age
)
Diabetes
Biological family history of congenital conditions
Viral infections
like
hepatitis A
or
Zika virus
during pregnancy
How do healthcare providers measure levels?
A
blood test
or
urinalysis
measures estrogen levels, including estriol levels during pregnancy. A blood test is a simple blood draw in your healthcare provider’s office or a lab.
A
24-hour urine test
is the most accurate way to measure estriol levels. You collect pee (urine) in a container over 24 hours. Then, you return the filled container to your provider’s office or lab for testing.
At-home test kits can measure estrogen in saliva (spit). But if you’re pregnant, your provider will want to use a more reliable method.
What do abnormal estriol levels mean?
During pregnancy, low levels of estriol may show a problem with the placenta. This result can also signal differences in the fetus, like
Down syndrome
.
A sudden increase of estriol before the 37th week of pregnancy may mean you’re at risk for
premature labor
.
People who have low levels of estriol right before childbirth may not go into labor on their own. Healthcare providers will use
labor induction
methods to kickstart labor.
Your healthcare provider will go over the results with you in detail and explain what they could mean. Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Depending on the results, they may recommend follow-up testing (like an
ultrasound
) or refer you to a
genetic counselor
.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Estriol has an important job during pregnancy. Your healthcare provider may want to check your estriol levels during pregnancy along with other tests. It can be stressful to see an abnormal result. Know that your provider will explain the result and support you.
