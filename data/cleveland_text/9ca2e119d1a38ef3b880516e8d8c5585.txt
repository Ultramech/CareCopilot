Thrombosed Hemorrhoid
Thrombosed hemorrhoids are when a blood clot forms inside a hemorrhoid. It can cause pain and itching. You’ll often see a blueish purple lump around your butthole. At-home treatment with sitz bath and over-the-counter creams and ointments can help treat thrombosed hemorrhoids. In severe cases, medical treatment is necessary.

Overview
Thrombosed hemorrhoids are when a blood clot forms inside a hemorrhoid. They cause pain, itching and a lump that you can see or feel around your anus.
What is a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
A thrombosed hemorrhoid is when a
blood clot
forms inside a
hemorrhoid
. A hemorrhoid is a swollen
vein
in your
rectum
or
anus
. Sometimes, the swelling makes blood inside of the vein clot. This causes symptoms like pain, itching and
rectal bleeding
. Thrombosed hemorrhoids appear as a purple-blue lump, usually around your anus (butthole).

Thrombosed hemorrhoids can be external or internal:
An external thrombosed hemorrhoid forms around your anus (or butthole). You may see a dark blue or purple lump. It can cause severe pain when sitting or walking. This type is more common.
An internal thrombosed hemorrhoid forms inside your rectum. You usually can’t see an internal thrombosed hemorrhoid unless it bulges outside of your anus.
Most thrombosed hemorrhoids get better with at-home treatments. If these don’t help, your healthcare provider may need to remove the clot in the office.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
The biggest sign is a blueish-purple lump on or around your butthole. You can often see it or feel it. It can be extremely painful and tender.
Other symptoms include:
Pain, especially when sitting, walking or pooping
Bleeding from your anus (especially if it ruptures or bursts)
Itching
What causes a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
They occur when a blood clot develops inside a hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoids occur due to increased pressure in your rectum. This can happen when you perform activities that involve straining. (The clot is just in your anus and doesn’t travel to other parts of your body.)
Hemorrhoids are also more common as you age because the tissues and veins in your rectum weaken. This makes them even more likely to swell under pressure.

Any hemorrhoid has the possibility of becoming thrombosed. Activities or conditions that put you at risk for hemorrhoids are:
Frequent
constipation
Straining to poop
Sitting on the toilet for long periods of time
Weightlifting or lifting heavy objects
Obesity
Pregnancy
or
vaginal delivery
(from pushing)
Not using the bathroom as soon as you get the urge to poop
Anal intercourse
Being inactive or spending most of your day sitting
What are the complications of a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
Thrombosed hemorrhoids aren’t life-threatening, but they can be very painful. Other than severe pain, other possible complications include:
Infection, which can cause a
perianal abscess
Bleeding that can be alarming if the hemorrhoid bursts
You should contact your healthcare provider if you notice signs of infection, like a
fever
or
chills
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a thrombosed hemorrhoid diagnosed?
A healthcare provider diagnoses thrombosed hemorrhoids based on your symptoms and a
rectal exam
. Often, you’ll have intense and sudden pain and a visible lump at your anus. This is usually all a provider needs to diagnose a thrombosed hemorrhoid. They may also ask you if you have frequent constipation.
Management and Treatment
How is a thrombosed hemorrhoid treated?
Treatment often depends on the severity of the hemorrhoid. Most people feel the pain is most intense in the first 48 hours. You’ll usually find relief from at-home treatments like:
Taking
sitz baths
Eating a lot of
fiber-rich foods
and drinking lots of water to soften your stool
Using topical pain relievers or hemorrhoid creams containing
hydrocortisone
,
witch hazel
or
lidocaine
Taking pain relievers like
ibuprofen
Using
stool softeners
or
laxatives
to make pooping less painful
Often, at-home and over-the-counter treatments are enough to make a thrombosed hemorrhoid go away. Your body will eventually reabsorb the blood clot, and the pain will improve a little each day.
Draining the clot is an option if your pain is severe or you still feel a lot of pain after a few days of at-home treatment. Your healthcare provider may suggest a
hemorrhoidectomy
to remove the hemorrhoid.
Do thrombosed hemorrhoids go away on their own?
Yes, most of them will go away within a few weeks.
How do they drain a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
You should never attempt to drain a hemorrhoid on your own. Only healthcare providers should remove or drain a thrombosed hemorrhoid.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
No one wants to have hemorrhoids. They can be disruptive and uncomfortable. If a hemorrhoid causes intense pain and you notice a lump around your anus, it’s likely thrombosed. Most thrombosed hemorrhoids go away with at-home treatments like sitz baths and softening your stool. If you’re still in a lot of pain after a few days, contact a healthcare provider. They can take a look and recommend another way to treat a thrombosed hemorrhoid.

Prevention
How do I prevent a thrombosed hemorrhoid?
Any hemorrhoid can become thrombosed. So, the best prevention strategy is to reduce the risk of hemorrhoids altogether. Avoiding constipation is key.
Other tips are:
Make sure you eat enough fiber. You can also take
fiber supplements
.
Drink plenty of water.
Don’t strain to have a bowel movement.
Avoid sitting on the toilet too long.
Get regular exercise.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your provider if you have a thrombosed hemorrhoid that causes you pain. While most get better in a few days on their own, you may need your healthcare provider’s help. A thrombosed hemorrhoid can become infected or rupture.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A thrombosed hemorrhoid can make everyday tasks like walking or sitting extremely painful. Fortunately, sitting in a sitz bath or using topical ointments can help you feel better. If they don’t, contact your healthcare provider to see what they recommend doing next. While it can be awkward to discuss your butthole, it may be necessary to find the relief you need.
