Metatarsus Adductus
Metatarsus adductus is a condition some babies are born with. The bones and tissue of the front part of the foot and toes curve inward. Many babies grow out of metatarsus adductus on their own, or healthcare providers can treat the condition with stretching exercises, casts and corrective shoes. Rarely, surgery is needed to correct the condition.

Who does metatarsus adductus affect?
Metatarsus adductus usually affects infants. It can affect one or both feet. If you have metatarsus adductus in adulthood, the condition has likely been present since you were born.
How common is metatarsus adductus?
Metatarsus adductus is the most common foot deformity that healthcare providers see in babies. About 1 in 1,000 babies are born with this
birth defect
. But some studies say it’s more common than that, and up to 12% of babies are born with metatarsus adductus.
How will metatarsus adductus affect my child?
Most babies grow out of metatarsus adductus on their own or with stretching or other treatment. Some babies born with this condition may also have developmental
hip dysplasia
.
What is the difference between metatarsus adductus versus clubfoot?
Like metatarsus adductus,
clubfoot
is a congenital foot condition. Babies with clubfoot have changes in the tendons that connect the muscles and bones of their leg and foot. Tight, short tendons cause the baby’s foot to turn in so severely that the bottom (sole) of the foot faces up or sideways.
Skew foot is another congenital condition that can affect a baby’s feet. In skew foot, the bones of the toes and heels form a Z shape. This condition can cause trouble with walking (
gait disorders
).
Symptoms and Causes
What causes metatarsus adductus?
Healthcare providers aren’t sure why some children develop metatarsus adductus. The condition may run in families (
genetic disorder
). Other causes may include:

Compression in the uterus during
fetal development
.
Not enough amniotic fluid (
oligohydramnios
).
What are the symptoms of metatarsus adductus?
Metatarsus adductus causes the outer edge of the foot and the toes to turn in. This curved shape may be mild or severe. In some children, the feet become rigid.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is metatarsus adductus diagnosed?
Your child’s healthcare provider may notice a curve in your child’s foot during a
well-baby care visit
. Or, as your child begins to walk, you may notice signs of metatarsus adductus, like their feet turning in (
pigeon toes or intoeing
).
What tests do healthcare providers use to diagnose metatarsus adductus?
Healthcare providers diagnose metatarsus adductus with a physical examination. Your provider may recommend an
X-ray
if your child’s foot is rigid.
Management and Treatment
How is metatarsus adductus treated?
Many babies grow out of metatarsus adductus by their first birthday without any treatment. If your child’s feet are rigid or the foot curve is severe, your healthcare provider may recommend consulting a pediatric orthopaedist. An
orthopaedist
specializes in treating problems of your
skeletal system
, which includes bones,
ligaments
and
tendons
.
What if my child doesn’t grow out of metatarsus adductus?
Your healthcare provider may recommend metatarsus adductus treatment if your child’s feet remain curved by their first birthday. They may also recommend treatment if the feet are rigid.
Your child’s healthcare provider may straighten your child’s feet with:
Casts or splints
that providers change weekly.
Shoes that help reshape the foot’s tissues and bones.
Your provider may recommend that you do stretching exercises with your child’s feet. If metatarsus adductus doesn’t resolve by about age 10, your healthcare provider may recommend surgery.
Is metatarsus adductus in adults treatable?
If your feet curve inward or you have trouble walking, see a doctor specializing in foot problems (podiatrist). While the condition is rare in adults, your provider may recommend special shoes to help correct metatarsus adductus.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has metatarsus adductus?
Your child may have many appointments with their healthcare provider. The provider may want to check their feet or, if your child is wearing a cast, the provider may need to change the cast weekly.
Make sure to bring your child to all their scheduled checkups and follow-up appointments. Your provider will check your child’s feet to see if metatarsus adductus is resolving or if your child needs further treatment.
How long does metatarsus adductus last?
Most babies grow out of metatarsus adductus in early childhood.
Prevention
How can I prevent metatarsus adductus in my child?
There’s no way to prevent the condition. If you notice curving in your child’s feet or that your child is walking in a way that’s not typical, tell your healthcare provider.
Are there other conditions that put my child at higher risk for metatarsus adductus?
If your baby has developmental hip dysplasia or a twisted neck (torticollis), they may be at higher risk for metatarsus adductus. Talk to your healthcare provider about any preventive steps they recommend.

How should I take care of my child with metatarsus adductus?
Follow all instructions from your child’s healthcare provider. There’s no need to limit your child’s physical activity or do any treatments unless your provider tells you to.
