What can I expect when getting my blood drawn by a phlebotomist?
If you have to get your blood drawn for a medical test or are donating blood, you can expect the following:
The phlebotomist will introduce themselves to you and confirm your identity.
The phlebotomist will put on gloves and apply a tourniquet (a stretchy band) to your upper arm to slow blood flow.
They’ll disinfect the area with an alcohol swab and identify which vein they’re going to draw from.
The phlebotomist will then insert a needle into your vein and attach a vial to the needle to collect a blood sample. They may collect just one vial or multiple depending on which tests your healthcare provider ordered.
After they’ve collected enough blood, they’ll release the tourniquet and then remove the needle.
They’ll dispose of the needle and apply pressure with a cotton ball to the affected area to stop the bleeding.
They’ll apply a bandage to the area, and you’ll be ready to go home.
Where do phlebotomists work?
Phlebotomists work in a variety of places, including:
Clinical laboratories.
