Femoral Hernia
A femoral hernia is a rare hernia in your upper thigh, just above the crease in your groin. This hernia type happens when tissue or intestine pokes through muscles and into your femoral canal. It may not cause symptoms. When it does, symptoms are abdominal pain and a bulge in your groin or upper thigh. Treatment is surgery to repair the hernia.

This hernia type may not cause symptoms. You may learn you have a femoral hernia after a routine physical examination. But femoral hernias can lead to more serious hernia issues. Your healthcare provider may recommend surgery to repair it.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a femoral hernia?
You may not have symptoms. If you do, they may include:
A bulge or lump in your groin or inner upper thigh
Lower abdominal pain
Nausea
and
vomiting
Pain in your groin or upper thigh that may feel like an ache or be sudden and sharp
You may notice your symptoms get worse when you stand for a long time, lift heavy objects or strain to poop or pee.
What causes a femoral hernia?
You can have a femoral hernia if tissue or a piece of intestine pushes through muscles in your lower abdomen. The hernia moves into the femoral canal that contains your
femoral artery
.
You may be born with a femoral hernia. The hernia may form during
fetal development
. But most femoral hernias happen when something puts pressure on your lower
abdominal muscles
. That can happen if you lift or push heavy objects. It may also happen if you:
Give birth
Have a
chronic cough
Have
obesity
Receive
peritoneal dialysis
for kidney disease or kidney failure
Strain to poop (
constipation
)
What are the complications of a femoral hernia?
A femoral hernia may get stuck in your femoral canal (
incarcerated hernia
). Pressure on it can affect blood flow to tissue inside the hernia (
strangulated hernia
). A strangulated hernia is a medical emergency.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is a femoral hernia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical exam
. They’ll ask if the bulge in your groin or upper thigh comes and goes. They may ask if the bulge appears when you do things like straining to poop or lifting heavy objects.
They may do tests to rule out other conditions that cause femoral hernia symptoms. Those tests may include
MRI
, CT scan or
ultrasound
. Conditions that may be mistaken for a femoral hernia include:
Femoral artery aneurysm
. This may cause a lump in your groin.
Hydrocele
. Males may have swollen scrotums from fluid filling a sac in their scrotums.
Inguinal hernia
.
Nuk cyst
. This rare condition affects females. It causes a painful swelling in your groin.
Psoas abscess
. This is an
abscess
in your
psoas muscle
.
Swollen lymph nodes
in your groin
.
Swollen veins in your scrotum (
varicocele
)
.
Management and Treatment
What are treatments for a femoral hernia?
Treatment is
hernia repair surgery
. Surgery reduces your risk of complications like an incarcerated or strangulated hernia.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a femoral hernia?
Hernia repair surgery cures a femoral hernia. But you can develop another one. Ask your surgeon if there’s a chance you’ll have another femoral hernia. They may recommend routine follow-up exams. That way, you and your provider can make sure you don’t have another femoral hernia and need more treatment.
Prevention
Can femoral hernias be prevented?
Weak lower abdominal muscles increase the risk you’ll have a femoral hernia. Protecting and strengthening those muscles may prevent one. Here are some suggestions:
Eat well to maintain a weight that’s right for you.
Get treatment for chronic coughing and sneezing.
Lift heavy objects with your legs instead of tightening your stomach muscles.
Manage chronic constipation. Straining to poop puts pressure on your abdominal muscles.
Strengthen your core.

When should I seek care?
Talk to your provider if you have a femoral hernia and develop symptoms of an incarcerated hernia. Symptoms may include:
Nausea or vomiting
Severe pain in your inner upper thigh or groin
Swelling at the site of the incarcerated hernia that’s tender to the touch
An incarcerated femoral hernia may become strangulated. That means blood can’t get to the tissue or intestine inside a femoral hernia. A strangulated hernia is a medical emergency. Call 911 (or your local emergency service number) or go to the emergency room if the skin around a femoral hernia turns reddish or darker than usual.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your routine physical exam and follow-up test shows you have a femoral hernia. You don’t have symptoms. So, it may be surprising when your healthcare provider recommends surgery. But this rare type of hernia often leads to serious complications. Surgery to fix the hernia is the only way to cure it and avoid these complications.
