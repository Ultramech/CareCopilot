P-Shot
The P-Shot uses platelet-rich plasma to possibly treat penile-related conditions. There isn’t enough research on the P-Shot to verify its benefits or determine how or why it works. Risks include bruising, swelling and discoloration.

Overview
What is a P-Shot?
A Priapus Shot® (P-Shot®) is an experimental type of
platelet-rich plasma
(PRP) injection for treating conditions that affect your penis and increasing sexual performance. In other parts of the body, healthcare providers typically use PRP injections to help treat injured:

Muscles
.
Joints
.
Tendons
.
Ligaments
.
In those instances, providers use a needle to remove blood from a
vein
(usually an arm) and separate the
platelets
from the rest of your blood. Platelets help your blood clot and heal wounds. They then inject your own platelets into the damaged area of your body to promote healing. During a P-Shot, providers inject the platelet-rich plasma directly into your penis.
There are many claims about the benefits of P-Shots for penile-related conditions, including
erections
.
However, these reports aren’t from healthcare providers or medical researchers. Clinical trials don’t show that the P-Shot improves erections, and it’s expensive. But there aren’t many side effects to the P-Shot.
What does the P-Shot do?
So far, there isn’t any good evidence that the P-Shot helps treat penile-related conditions. Some claim that the P-Shot helps increase blood flow to your penis and repairs body tissues and cells, which can help with the following conditions:
Erectile dysfunction
(ED)
. ED is when you can’t get or keep an
erection
that’s hard enough for sexual intercourse. There’s good scientific evidence that shows the P-Shot can’t treat ED.
Peyronie’s disease
. Peyronie’s disease is when scar tissue builds up in your penis (usually after an injury to your erect penis) and causes it to bend or curve. It can be painful, and it may make sexual intercourse for you or your partner difficult or impossible. There’s currently no good scientific evidence about using the P-Shot with Peyronie’s disease.
Lichen sclerosus
. Lichen sclerosus can cause itching, irritation, white or shiny skin, blisters, cracks or scarring on your penis. There currently isn’t any good scientific evidence about using the P-Shot with lichen sclerosus.

Some claims also allege that the P-Shot can help increase sensation and pleasure during sexual intercourse, including greater
ejaculation control
. But there’s no scientific evidence to support this claim.
Does the P-Shot increase penis size?
Some claim that the P-Shot can increase penis length and girth by design. They may inject more platelet-rich plasma into the base penis, shaft or head (glans) of your penis according to where you would like to see results. This claim isn’t supported by any scientific evidence.
Who is a good candidate for the P-Shot?
Overall, even though PRP is helpful in other parts of the body, research hasn’t shown that the P-Shot is beneficial for penile-related symptoms. Be aware that the procedure is expensive, and you may not get the results you desire. If you still choose to get a P-Shot, it’s important to feel comfortable with the possibility that it may not work.
Treatment Details
What happens during P-Shot treatment?
You don’t need to do any preparation before receiving a P-Shot. But you may want to wear comfortable clothes that you can easily pull down or remove, such as athletic shorts or sweatpants. The P-Shot is an experimental procedure, so there’s no standard process. But in general, the provider will:
Take a blood sample from a vein. They’ll then process your blood in a centrifuge. A centrifuge spins quickly to separate the parts of your blood by their density. They’ll then draw the PRP into a syringe.
Apply a numbing cream or inject a numbing agent to help with pain during the PRP shot.
Inject the PRP into different areas of your penis.
How long does a P-Shot treatment take?
The entire P-Shot process usually takes less than 30 minutes.
How long will I need a P-Shot?
There’s no data to show how many P-Shots you may need or for how long. Some services recommend a yearly P-Shot. Others recommend it more frequently.
You should only continue to get P-Shots if you feel it helps you and you have realistic expectations.
How effective is the P-Shot?
There isn’t enough research to accurately determine the P-Shot’s effectiveness. Some people may see results within a few days. It may take others several months or multiple P-Shots to see results, or they might not see any changes at all. Talk to a healthcare provider. They can help you determine if the P-Shot is right for you.
What are the risks or complications of the P-Shot?
The P-Shot is a relatively safe procedure. Minor risks may include:
Bruising
.
Discoloration (red, purple or dark brown).
Swelling.
Infection.
How painful is the P-Shot?
Your penis and the surrounding areas are sensitive. Numbing cream or injections should help reduce P-Shot pain during the procedure. But you may feel some pressure or discomfort as you receive the P-Shot that increases as the numbing agent wears off.

Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better?
You should be able to return to your normal activities quickly after a P-Shot.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
It’s a good idea to schedule a follow-up appointment a few weeks after receiving a P-Shot to see how well you respond to the treatment. You may need to schedule additional follow-up appointments if you need more treatments.

Reach out to your healthcare provider immediately if you:
Have signs of infection.
Have pain that lasts longer than a few days or gets worse.
Experience numbness on your penis or the surrounding areas more than a few hours after treatment.
Additional Common Questions
What kind of healthcare provider should I see for a P-Shot?
You should first talk to your
primary care physician
if you want to know whether the P-Shot would work for you. They can review your personal and family medical history and help diagnose a condition that may affect your penis. They may also refer you to a
urologist
. Urologists specialize in sexual health and penile conditions. They can accurately explain the risks and potential benefits of a P-Shot for you.
If you choose to get a P-Shot, it’s important to ask for the qualifications and experience of the provider giving you the shot. Most people who advertise P-Shots aren’t penile or sexual health experts.
How much does a P-Shot cost?
Health insurance companies don’t cover P-Shot treatments. Out-of-pocket treatment estimates are over $1,000 for one injection. If you choose to get a P-Shot, contact different clinics to compare prices and learn about the qualifications of the person giving the shot.
What is an O-Shot?
The Orgasm Shot® (O-Shot®) is an experimental type of PRP injection that healthcare providers may use to treat conditions that affect your
vagina
. These may include:

Urinary incontinence
.
Vaginal dryness
.
Low sex drive
(libido).
Difficulty orgasming.
Like the P-Shot, there isn’t enough research on the O-Shot’s ability to effectively treat vaginal conditions.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
There is some thought that the Priapus Shot (P-Shot) may effectively treat some conditions that affect your penis. But it needs more research to support its potential claims. Though the risks are low, the P-Shot can be costly and might not work for you. Talk to a healthcare provider. They can answer any questions you have about your health and recommend other treatments with more substantial research and predictable results. Get a second opinion if you’re still not sure.
