Transient Synovitis
Transient synovitis (also known as toxic synovitis) causes hip pain in children that may come on gradually or all of a sudden. Thankfully, it’s not a serious condition. All your child needs is rest and maybe ibuprofen to help relieve their pain. While it may sound alarming, this harmless condition usually clears up on its own within a week or two.

What Is Transient Synovitis?
Transient synovitis, or toxic synovitis, is swelling and
inflammation
around your
synovial membranes
. Synovial membranes are tissues that surround your joints. “Transient” means it doesn’t last long before it goes away. In children, transient synovitis frequently affects the
hip joints
. The condition is the most common cause of hip pain in children.

The age range for transient synovitis is between 3 and 10 years old. Sometimes, it happens in kids younger than 3. The condition occurs more often in
boys
. It usually only affects one hip (more commonly, the right hip).
Other names for transient
synovitis
(pronounced “sin-uh-VIE-tis”) include:
Transient synovitis of the hip
Transient hip
Irritable hip
Synovitis hip
No one wants to see their child experience pain. But rest assured, transient synovitis isn’t a serious condition. With rest and supportive care, your child should feel better within a week or two.
Symptoms and Causes
Toxic synovitis symptoms
The main symptom of toxic synovitis is
hip pain
. The pain may come on slowly — your child may not even notice it at first. Other times, it happens quickly. The pain may cause your child to:
Have problems standing
Have trouble walking
Walk with a limp
Some children experience thigh or knee pain instead of hip pain.
What causes transient synovitis?
Researchers don’t know what causes transient synovitis. But they’ve noticed that the condition often occurs following
upper respiratory infections
. It frequently shows up after your child has had symptoms of the common cold, vomiting or diarrhea. They’ve also found that toxic synovitis sometimes happens after:
Bacterial infections
Trauma
Allergic reactions

Complications of transient synovitis of the hip
The main complication of transient synovitis is the chance of the condition coming back (recurring). Transient synovitis recurs in
up to 2 in 10 cases
. But this may happen because children return to their normal activities too soon.
In up to 1 in 10 cases, a condition called
Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
(LCPD) can occur. LCPD is a condition that causes your child’s hip bones to break down and then regrow. This can change the shape of your child’s hip bones.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose transient synovitis
Your child’s healthcare provider will ask about your child’s symptoms and medical history. They’ll want to know about any recent infections or trauma.
Your child’s provider will also do a physical exam. They’ll check the range of motion in your child’s hip joint. They want to see what kind of movement makes their pain worse.
Tests that are used
Providers don’t use a specific test to diagnose transient synovitis. Depending on their assessment, they may request several tests to rule out other, more serious conditions, like
septic arthritis
. These tests may include:
Blood tests, like
complete blood count (CBC)
Imaging tests, like X-ray, ultrasound and MRI
Joint aspiration
Management and Treatment
Treatment for transient synovitis involves rest and supportive care at home.
How do you treat toxic synovitis?
Treatment for transient synovitis involves supportive care at home. Along with ensuring your child rests their hip, you can:
Give them nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (
NSAIDs
), like ibuprofen (Advil®)
Apply a warm compress to their hip joint
Massage their hip
Your child may also find relief by practicing yoga. There are many
yoga poses that stretch the hip muscles
.
When should my child see their healthcare provider?
If your child develops a fever, their healthcare provider will want to see them right away. A fever may mean your child has a more serious hip condition.
If your child is still experiencing a lot of pain after 10 days, they should see their provider again. Their provider may want to do other tests to make sure your child doesn’t have another condition.
To follow up, your child’s provider may want to see your child again after a week or two. Depending on your child’s situation, they may want to take X-rays of your child’s hip again in 6 months.

Outlook / Prognosis
How long can toxic synovitis last?
Transient synovitis doesn’t last long. With rest and at-home care, your child’s symptoms should start to improve within 24 to 48 hours. Complete relief from hip pain may take one to two weeks. It may be longer if your child gets back into their normal routine too soon.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
When your previously healthy child starts crying in pain and can’t walk, it can be alarming. Not knowing what your child is experiencing can bring panic and worry. Thankfully, transient synovitis isn’t serious. It’s a relatively common condition that affects many young children. It’s hard to see your child in pain. But it may help to know that the condition should go away on its own within a week or two. Until then, encourage your child to rest. They’ll be back on their feet soon.
