Triple-Positive Breast Cancer
Triple-positive breast cancer grows in response to excess HER2 protein and the hormones estrogen and progesterone. It’s a type of HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Standard treatments like surgery and chemotherapy, alongside targeted therapy and hormone therapy, are often successful at treating this cancer.

What Is Triple-Positive Breast Cancer?
Triple-positive breast cancers grow in response to sex hormones and a protein called HER2. As part of your diagnosis, a provider will test the cancer cells. The cancer is triple-positive if results show that cancer cells are:

Estrogen-receptor positive (ER+)
: Cancer cells grow in response to estrogen.
Progesterone-receptor positive (PR+)
: Cancer cells grow in response to progesterone.
HER2-positive (HER2+)
: Cancer cells have too much HER2 protein, which fuels their growth.
About 10 in every 100
females
diagnosed with breast cancer have this type. In the past, it was one of the worst types to get. This is because HER2+ breast cancers are often aggressive (fast-growing).
But today’s treatments fight HER2+ breast cancers effectively. People with triple-positive breast cancer are living longer lives, free of cancer.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of triple-positive breast cancer
Triple-positive breast cancer symptoms are the same as
breast cancer
symptoms, in general. The most common sign is a new lump in your breast or armpit.
Breast lumps
can be cancerous or benign. Only a healthcare provider can tell the difference. This is why you should get checked if you find a new lump.
Triple-positive breast cancer causes
This cancer happens when a breast cell transforms (mutates) into a cancer cell. Experts don’t know what causes the mutation.
They do know that, just like normal breast cells, the cancer cells have hormone receptors and HER2 proteins. In healthy cells, these things help control cell growth and development.

But these same features allow cancer cells to make more cells. The cells may form a tumor. Without treatment, the cancer can spread.
Risk factors
The risk factors for triple-positive breast cancer are the same as for breast cancer. For example, breast cancer risk increases with age. Having a mutation in your
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
genes also increases your risk. You inherit these mutations from a biological parent.
But most people with breast cancer don’t have these genes. Triple-positive breast cancer isn’t hereditary. Most involve gene changes that happen during your lifetime.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Healthcare providers use lab tests to diagnose triple-positive breast cancer. First, they’ll do a
biopsy
. This involves removing tissue from the lump and sending it to a lab to test for cancer. They may also test your lymph nodes.
If they find cancer, they’ll check for excess HER2 proteins on the cells. They’ll look for estrogen and progesterone receptors. If the cells have all three, you have triple-positive breast cancer.
Other tests used
You’ll also need imaging procedures that show where the cancer is located in your body. Imaging helps your provider
stage
cancer
. Staging shows how much it’s spread. Like receptor status, cancer stage helps your provider plan treatment.
Management and Treatment
How is triple-positive breast cancer treated?
The most common treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. You may need
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
after surgery to destroy cells that surgery may have missed. You may need these treatments before surgery to shrink the tumor so it’s easier to remove.
Other treatments prevent cancer from using HER2 and hormones to grow.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
treatments prevent HER2 from fueling cancer cell growth. Types include:
Antibody-drug conjugates
Monoclonal antibodies (the most well-known is trastuzumab)
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Most people receive targeted therapy alongside chemotherapy treatment. You usually get these treatments as an IV (through a vein). You may need to continue targeted therapy after you finish chemotherapy. Targeted therapy usually takes about a year.
Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy
blocks hormones that fuel cancer cell growth. It usually involves taking a pill. Examples include:
Aromatase inhibitors
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists
Tamoxifen
Most people are on hormone therapy for at least five years. But how long you’ll need it depends on cancer stage and treatment side effects.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Let your provider know if you’re having symptoms that may mean
cancer has come back
. Tell them about new or unexpected treatment side effects.

Ask which symptoms or side effects mean you should go to the emergency room.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for triple-positive breast cancer?
HER2-positive breast cancer had one of the worst prognoses before targeted therapies. Now, treatments that can block the effects of HER2 have completely changed the outlook.
According to the National Cancer Institute (U.S.), more than
90 out of 100
women are alive five years after their diagnoses. Typically, the earlier your cancer stage, the better your outcomes.
What is the recurrence rate of triple-positive breast cancer?
Medical experts are still learning how long treatment sends triple-positive breast cancer into remission (no signs or symptoms of cancer). But targeted therapy and chemotherapy together may reduce the risk of cancer coming back.
ER+ breast cancers grow slowly but can return years after treatment. Your provider may suggest that you continue hormone therapy to reduce the risk.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Testing positive for three factors that make cancer grow may make you worry. But when it comes to this diagnosis, it means you’re eligible for really effective treatments. Targeted therapy for HER2+ breast cancers saves lives. Hormone therapy is helping those with triple-positive breast cancer live longer than ever.
Still, it’s important to keep tabs on your health. Ask your healthcare provider about the signs that may mean a recurrence. In the meantime, they’ll monitor you closely. They’ll restart treatment as needed if the cancer returns.
