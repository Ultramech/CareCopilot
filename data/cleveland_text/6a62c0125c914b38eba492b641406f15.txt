What is a retina specialist?

The retina is the part of your eye that has light-sensing cells. Light comes in and becomes electrical signals that travel to your brain through the
optic nerve
.
The vitreous body, also called vitreous humor or vitreous fluid, is a substance resembling gel that lies between the lens and the retina. The vitreous humor helps
your
eyes keep their shape.
How many years of schooling do you need to become a retina specialist?
You first need to complete a bachelor’s degree. Then you’ll spend four years in medical school, followed by a one-year internship. After that, you’ll do a three-year residency in ophthalmology and then a two-year fellowship in vitreoretinal medicine.
Ophthalmologists
with subspecialty fellowship training complete as many as 10 additional years of education after finishing college.
Retina specialists continue their educations throughout their careers as they learn new techniques and technologies and keep up with the advances in eye care.
Retina specialist vs. ophthalmologist: what’s the difference?
A retina specialist is an ophthalmologist with additional training in diseases of the vitreous body and the retina. An ophthalmologist is a subspecialty doctor who focuses on preventing and treating diseases of the
eyes
.
What diseases do retina specialists treat?
A retina specialist is able to diagnose and treat many diseases, including those that affect your retina and the
macula
, which is part of the retina. These professionals also treat conditions that affect your vitreous.

What do retina specialists do?
Retina specialists manage serious and chronic eye conditions. Pediatric retina specialists manage conditions that babies are born with (congenital conditions). Uveitis retina specialists manage serious inflammatory conditions like infections and uveitis.
They can give intravitreal injections, or shots into the vitreous, and place intravitreal implants.
They can do a variety of surgeries like
vitrectomies
and repair of a ruptured globe.
What should I expect at an appointment with a retina specialist?
If you’re seeing a retina specialist, especially if it’s your first visit, you should expect a long appointment, perhaps as long as three hours.
You should ask a friend or family member to come with you to your appointment. You’ll need a driver because the eye drops used for the exam will temporarily alter your vision.
Your provider will want to know your medical history, any symptoms you might be having and any medications that you take.
Your provider will do a complete
eye exam
after putting drops in your eyes that dilate them (make the
pupils
bigger). The pupil is the black hole in the middle of the colored part of your eye.
Making the pupil larger makes it easier for your doctor to see the back of your eyes. The back of your eye is where your retina, macula and optic nerve are.
What tests do retina specialists use for diagnosis?
Your retina specialist may need a variety of tests to diagnose you correctly. These may include:
Slit lamp exam
.
Indirect ophthalmoscopy exam
. In this exam, your provider uses a lighted instrument and a lens to examine inside the back of your eye. This allows your provider to see more of the back of your eye.
Optical coherence tomography
.
Fluorescein angiography
.
Indocyanine green angiography imaging
. This test uses injectable indocyanine green, a dye, to allow certain parts of your eye to be more visible during imaging.
What questions should I ask a retina specialist?
If you have an appointment with a retina specialist, you may want to take a written list of questions and comments with you to an appointment, especially if it’s your first visit. You’ll want to make sure you understand everything you can about your condition and how to treat it.
If you’re comfortable having someone in the appointment with you, a friend or family member may be able to help you by taking notes. This can help you to be clear about your condition and the suggested treatment.
