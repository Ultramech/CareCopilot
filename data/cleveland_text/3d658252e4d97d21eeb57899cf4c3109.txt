Back Spasms
A spasm in your back muscles is a common type of back pain. They can be tiny twinges or crippling contractions. At-home treatments like ice and heat can help, as can muscle relaxants, massages, stretches and consistent exercise. Sometimes back spasms can be a sign of a serious disorder and you may need to see a healthcare provider right away.

Overview
What are back spasms?
A
spasm
is when your muscles suddenly tighten against your will. They may painfully twinge, seize or contract. The muscles in your upper, middle and lower back are divided into three types: intrinsic/deep muscles, superficial muscles and intermediate muscles. Lower back spasms are more common, but any muscle can contract.

How common are back spasms?
Around 80% of people in the U.S. have had or will have some sort of back pain in their lives. Back spasms and other back pain are, unfortunately, common.
How do back spasms start?
Back spasms can start with no warning, or they may begin as a mild twitch that builds to agonizing pain.
Who is more likely to get back spasms?
Athletes, those who do heavy lifting and anyone with other types of back pain are more likely to experience back spasms.
How do back spasms affect the rest of my body?
Sometimes pain from a back spasm can “radiate.” This means that the pain starts in your back but moves to other parts of your body like your legs or hips.
Are back spasms a sign of multiple sclerosis?
No, but back spasms are a symptom of other serious diseases like
gallstones
and
ankylosing spondylitis
.
Are back spasms a sign of labor?
No. If you’re in labor you’ll feel the muscles in your uterus contract, not your back. But you may have back pain in your lower back as part of
back labor
.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes back spasms?
There are a number of possible causes for back spasms:
Not using your muscles enough
. If you sit too much, have poor posture, don’t exercise or rarely use your back or stomach muscles, those muscles can get weak and spasm.
Using your muscles too much.
Athletes and those who do a lot of heavy lifting may experience back spasms. Such activities can cause a muscle strain, which is a tear, and that can cause inflammation.
Dietary issues.
Back spasms can be caused by too little water, potassium and/or calcium in your diet.
Mental/emotional health issues.
Anxiety and stress can tense up your muscles.
Trauma.
You may injure your back in a fall or car accident.

chest pain

Ice/heat:
Apply ice or heat to the location of your back spasms. Wrap the ice pack or heating pad in a towel or pillowcase and apply it to your skin for 20 to 30 minutes. Then reapply after 20 to 30 minutes.

Over-the-counter pain medications, including

Your provider may recommend taking a muscle relaxant like cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone or methocarbamol. If you do take them, take them at night (or when you're not operating a car or heavy machinery) and only for 72 hours or less.
Physical therapy:
Your healthcare provider might prescribe physical therapy, where you can learn relaxation techniques and stretches for your back muscles.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Remember that it’s important to stay active even when you’re in pain (as long as that pain isn’t caused by over-using your muscles)! Get up and stretch every 30 minutes and exercise three times a week. To help with your pain, take over-the-counter medications and muscle relaxants and get a massage. Always discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider so that you can get the best care.
Keep in mind that back spasms are sometimes a symptom of a serious disorder. Notice other symptoms you might have alongside them and go to the emergency department if you have tingling/numbness on one side, weakness or if you lose your ability to control your bowel or bladder. If you’re debating whether or not to go to the emergency department, it’s better to go and be told you’re not in serious condition than to stay home.
