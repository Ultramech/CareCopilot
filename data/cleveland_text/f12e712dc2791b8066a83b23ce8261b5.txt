Overview
What is R-CHOP?
R-CHOP is a
cancer treatment
regimen that uses a combination of five drugs to treat
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
. Treatment includes three
chemotherapy drugs
, a
targeted therapy
drug and a
corticosteroid (steroid)
.

Each letter in “R-CHOP” stands for a drug used for treatment:
R
:
Rituximab
is a targeted therapy drug that attaches to a protein on
cancer
cells. Once rituximab attaches, your
immune system
can find and destroy the cells.
C
:
Cyclophosphamide
is a chemotherapy drug. Chemotherapy drugs destroy fast-growing cells, like cancer cells.
H
:
Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Hydroxydaunomycin)
is a chemotherapy drug.
O:
Vincristine sulfate (Oncovin)
is a chemotherapy drug.
P
:
Prednisone
is a corticosteroid (steroid). It kills cancer cells and can help prevent allergic reactions to the other R-CHOP drugs.
As most of the drugs are chemotherapy medications, some providers call this treatment “R-CHOP chemotherapy” or “R-CHOP chemo.” But R-CHOP also involves a targeted therapy drug (Rituximab) that helps your immune system kill cancer cells. For this reason, your provider may call R-CHOP “
immuno
chemotherapy.”
What conditions are treated with R-CHOP?
Healthcare providers use R-CHOP to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including the most common type,
d
iffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
. Other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with R-CHOP include:
Advanced
follicular lymphoma
.
Mantle cell lymphoma
.
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia
.

Your provider may recommend R-CHOP alongside treatments for other cancer types.
Treatment Details
What happens during R-CHOP treatment?
You’ll receive R-CHOP in cycles. The typical cycle for R-CHOP treatment is three weeks (21 days). Cycles include:
Treatment days, where you get the medicine.
Rest days, so your body can recuperate before the next cycle.
Treatment days
You’ll receive medicine for five days.
Prednisone (the steroid) is a pill you take by mouth. For the other medicines, you’ll need to visit a hospital or clinic to get an intravenous infusion (IV) that sends the drugs to your bloodstream. For the infusion, you’ll sit in a chair while a machine sends the medicine through a plastic line into a vein. The vein may be in your arm, hand or chest. For infusions in your chest, you may need an implantable disc called a port-a-cath, also known as a
chemo port
.
The first R-CHOP treatment cycle goes like this:
R-CHOP Drug
When you’ll take it
How you’ll receive it
Rituximab
Day one.
An infusion that takes up to eight hours. (If you respond well to the medicine during the first cycle, you may just get a shot of Rituximab for future cycles.)
Cyclophosphamide
Day one.
An infusion that takes about half an hour.
Doxorubicin hydrochloride
Day one.
An infusion that takes about half an hour.
Vincristine sulfate
Day one,
An infusion that takes about 10 minutes.
Prednisone
Days one through day five.
Once daily by mouth, with a full glass of water and a meal. (It’s a good idea to take it consistently after breakfast.)

Once daily by mouth, with a full glass of water and a meal. (It’s a good idea to take it consistently after breakfast.)
You’ll receive medications to prevent nausea during your infusion. You’ll also receive
antihistamines
to prevent allergic reactions. It’s common to have a mild reaction to rituximab (feeling a little light-headed or flushed) during an infusion, but the medicine usually prevents serious reactions.
Rest days
For a typical R-CHOP cycle, you’ll need 16 days to give your body time to heal following the drug treatments. R-CHOP kills cancer cells, and this work takes a toll on your body. It’s normal to feel exhausted afterward. You may need to reach out to loved ones for help with everyday tasks during your rest days.
During rest days, if you have the energy, your healthcare provider may recommend that you do light activities, like walking or jogging. They may remind you to drink plenty of fluids and eat healthy foods.
How long will I need this treatment?
Most people treated receive six cycles of R-CHOP. Each cycle lasts three weeks (18 weeks total). But the number of R-CHOP cycles you need depends on your diagnosis. For example, some people need eight cycles of R-CHOP instead of six. Some providers recommend R-CHOP cycles that last two weeks instead of three.
Your healthcare provider will explain the R-CHOP treatment regimen you need.

Risks / Benefits
What are the potential benefits of this treatment?
All the drugs that are part of R-CHOP destroy cancer cells. But they all work in different ways. So, instead of having a single cancer fighter, with R-CHOP, you have an entire cancer-fighting force.
The success rate of R-CHOP is excellent. Up to 70% of people diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) go into complete
remission
(no signs or symptoms of cancer) and remain that way at the five-year follow-up mark. Most people with no signs of cancer within five years of diagnosis typically remain cancer-free.
It doesn’t always get rid of the cancer or prevent it from coming back for everyone. Still, R-CHOP has a reliable track record of being both a safe and effective treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

What are the risks or complications of R-CHOP?
Your healthcare provider will give you medications to prevent the most common side effects (like nausea) and counteract major issues (like
low white blood cell counts
). But as with any treatment, there are risks you should discuss with your provider before starting R-CHOP.
Infusion reactions
Many people have mild reactions to rituximab during the first R-CHOP cycle. This is why providers administer it so slowly at first — to give your body time to adjust to the medicine. Feeling light-headed or warm is common and usually passes. But you may need emergency treatment if the rituximab causes symptoms of a severe reaction, like:
A rash.
Itching.
Swelling in your mouth or lips.
Your throat closing up.
Your provider will monitor you to ensure your safety during the infusion, but you should seek emergency care if you notice these symptoms afterward.
Side effects
Each drug that’s a part of R-CHOP carries a risk of side effects. Everyone’s experience is different, so there’s no way to predict which ones you may experience. Talk with your provider beforehand about what side effects to expect.
Common side effects of R-CHOP include:
Reddish or pink urine (pee)
. The doxorubicin hydrochloride is red, and you’ll probably pee it out over the next 48 hours after your infusion. This is normal and nothing to worry about.
Nausea
and
vomiting
. Even with anti-nausea medicines, you still may experience nausea. In addition to taking anti-nausea medicines as prescribed, avoid things that may make you queasy, like eating large (especially fatty or spicy) meals.
Hair loss
. Hair loss is one of many common
chemotherapy side effects
. Most people start to lose hair within three weeks of the first infusion. It usually grows back after R-CHOP treatment.
Feeling chilled and feverish
.
The chemotherapy drugs reduce your
white blood cells
, leaving you more susceptible to an infection. You’ll get
G-CSF shots
that help your body make more white blood cells to give your
immune system
a boost. Still, contact your provider immediately if you have a fever.
Feeling extremely tired
. R-CHOP treatment can cause low red blood cells (
anemia
). If you’re feeling
fatigue
set in, it’s a good idea to get help with everyday tasks. In the meantime, try to get moderate exercise (about 30 minutes) daily, but don’t overdo it. If you’re feeling tired, rest.
Bleeding and bruising more easily
. R-CHOP treatment can leave you with low
platelets
. This means you’ll bleed more easily. You should take extra precautions to avoid injuries. In the meantime, let your provider know if you’re bleeding more or showing signs of bruising.
Tingling or
numbness in your hands
or feet
. You may notice signs of
peripheral neuropathy
, like tingling, numbness or even a burning sensation in your hands or feet. Contact your provider if you’re experiencing symptoms.

There are several other side effects of R-CHOP, including (but not limited to):
Rash
.
Mouth sores
.
Headache
.
Constipation
.
Diarrhea
.
Heartburn
.
Muscle weakness.
Trouble sleeping.
Mood changes.
Irregular heartbeat.
Retained water and unexplained weight gain.
Having to pee more or a burning feeling when you pee (signs of
bladder inflammation
).
Long-term effects of R-CHOP
Most side effects go away in time after you finish treatment.
But depending on things like how strong your dose is, R-CHOP may increase your risk of heart problems or developing other types of cancer in the future. It can also impact fertility, when you’re unable to get pregnant or impregnate someone.
Discuss these risks with your healthcare provider beforehand. You can discuss
fertility preservation
options, like freezing your eggs or sperm, if you’d like to try for a baby at some point after R-CHOP treatment.
Recovery and Outlook
What can I do to make this treatment easier on me?
The best thing you can do to make treatment easier is to be informed about what to expect.
Talk to your healthcare provider about what side effects to expect and how to cope if you start to notice signs of them. Ask them to connect you with support groups of other people with lymphoma who are getting R-CHOP. Being able to share your experience with others who can relate to your experience is one of the best ways to get through cancer treatment.

When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Contact your provider if you have new or worsening symptoms during R-CHOP treatment. Let them know immediately if you have a fever.
Go to the ER immediately if you’re experiencing signs of an emergency, like difficulty breathing or sudden
chest pain
.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between R-CHOP and CHOP chemotherapy?
R-CHOP cancer treatment is an improvement on CHOP chemotherapy. CHOP was developed in the early 1990s. It quickly became the standard in treating and even curing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
In the early 2000s, cancer researchers added the targeted therapy drug rituximab to the CHOP regimen. R-CHOP further improved the cure rate for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has replaced CHOP chemotherapy as the most effective treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
The several weeks that you’re on R-CHOP treatment may be tough. Infusion days can be long, and the side effects that set in after may take some work to manage. But for most people, the potential benefits of R-CHOP are well worth it. The three drug types (targeted therapy, chemotherapy and steroid) effectively destroy cancer cells. Depending on your diagnosis, it can send the cancer into remission — for good. Talk to your healthcare provider about both the benefits and the risks before starting R-CHOP.
