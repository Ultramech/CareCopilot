Children aren’t just small adults. Pediatric surgeons know your child is still growing and developing. They know children have unique medical needs. Some health conditions only affect children. Others affect children in different ways than adults. Many surgical techniques and tools are designed specifically for children.
Pediatric surgeons have extensive training and experience working with kids. They know how to make your child feel safe and comfortable. They also understand that hearing
your child needs surgery
can be scary and overwhelming. They’ll be there for you to answer your questions and reassure you that your child is in good hands.

Repair birth defects, like congenital malformations
Treat groin issues, like
inguinal hernias

Perform
minimally invasive surgery

When should your child see one?
There are many reasons your child may need to see a pediatric surgeon. If your child’s pediatrician refers you to a pediatric surgeon, it’s because your child needs specialized surgical care to diagnose, treat or manage their condition.

Additional Common Questions
How do you become a pediatric surgeon?
You need about 15 years of training after high school to become a pediatric surgeon. This includes a:
Bachelor’s degree (four years)
Medical degree (four years)
Residency in general surgery (five years)
Fellowship in pediatric surgery (two years)
In the U.S., you need to get certification from the American Board of Surgery in both general surgery and pediatric surgery.
How do you choose a pediatric surgeon?
Look for a board-certified pediatric surgeon who operates at a hospital that regularly cares for children. Ask about the team’s experience with your child’s specific condition. Also ask:
Whether minimally invasive options are available
About pain control plans
What to expect during recovery
And it’s OK to ask for a second opinion.
