Wolf Spider Bite
Wolf spiders may look scary, but their venom isn’t dangerous to humans. Due to their size, a wolf spider bite may cause some pain and swelling. But these symptoms should subside on their own and you shouldn’t require medical attention. You can take steps to prevent wolf spider bites.

Overview
Wolf spiders are one of the most common types of spiders. They can be found throughout the U.S.
Does a wolf spider bite?
Yes, all spiders can bite. But the bite of a wolf spider is typically harmless. While it may puncture your
skin
and cause redness, pain and swelling, it doesn’t normally require medical attention.

Wolf spiders are one of the most common types of spiders. They live on all continents but Antarctica, and this family of spiders includes more than 2,400 species worldwide. They can be found in many different environments. You may encounter them outdoors — among fallen leaves, grassy areas or burrows. But you may also find them indoors, especially in basements, sheds and garages.
Wolf spiders get their name from the way they hunt their prey like a wolf. They don’t catch their prey by spinning webs. They use their excellent eyesight, and some build underground burrows so they can jump out and ambush prey that get too close to the opening. Like most spiders, wolf spiders have eight eyes — two of which are rather large — that shine in the light.
Wolf spiders can be dark brown or gray and may have stripes or markings down their backs. They use these markings to camouflage themselves. They can be hairy and large — up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) long in the U.S. — and are sometimes mistaken for
brown recluses
. But brown recluses have a violin-shaped marking on their head and only have six eyes.
When do I need to worry about a wolf spider bite?
Wolf spiders aren’t aggressive toward people. They usually only bite when they feel threatened, like when you trap them or unintentionally come into contact with them. If they do bite you, you may experience some uncomfortable symptoms. But you don’t typically need to worry because the venom of a wolf spider isn’t deadly.

Other types of spiders pose more danger. Brown recluses, along with black widows, are much more dangerous than wolf spiders. If you have a more severe reaction, you may have been bitten by one of these spiders. Rarely, people are allergic to all
spider bites
.
Symptoms and Causes
What does a wolf spider bite look like?
A wolf spider bite may look like a bug bite. You may notice a red bump and swelling in the bite area. In addition, a wolf spider may puncture your skin and leave fang-like marks. Other wolf spider bite symptoms may include pain and
itching
.
If you experience any symptoms of an
allergic reaction
from a spider bite, you should seek medical attention. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:
A red line extending from the spider bite.
A bump that looks like
hives
and increases in size.
Swelling of your face, especially around your mouth.

What causes wolf spider bites?
Wolf spiders aren’t usually aggressive toward humans. Bites only occur when a wolf spider feels threatened and needs to defend itself.
What are the risk factors for wolf spider bites?
Anyone can accidentally make contact with a wolf spider and get bitten. But certain people may be at a higher risk due to their jobs or actions that put them in closer contact with places where these spiders live. People at risk include:
Outdoor workers, including groundskeepers, landscapers and farmworkers.
Children who play around rocks or in piles of leaves.
Hikers.
Custodians and maintenance workers.
Machine operators.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a wolf spider bite diagnosed?
There’s no test that can tell what kind of spider bit you. Seeing the spider is the only way to determine if it was a wolf spider. But your provider may make a diagnosis of a spider bite based on a
physical exam
and your symptoms.
Management and Treatment
How is a wolf spider bite treated?
Wolf
spider bite treatment
includes measures to avoid infection and manage any pain, swelling or itching. You can take the following at-home steps to treat a wolf spider bite:
Clean the bite with warm water and soap.
Apply an
ice pack
or a cold, damp washcloth to the bite.
Take an
antihistamine
to relieve itching. You want to avoid scratching, which can increase your risk of infection.
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever to ease pain and swelling.
Your symptoms should clear up on their own within a few days. See your healthcare provider if your symptoms persist or get worse.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis (outlook) for people who have wolf spider bites?
If a wolf spider bites you, you may experience mild symptoms like pain and swelling. But these symptoms should slowly go away with at-home care.
Most wolf spider bites are harmless and don’t require any medical attention. But if your symptoms get worse or don’t go away after a few days of self-care, reach out to your healthcare provider for further treatment.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Wolf spiders are big, hairy and scary-looking, but they only bite when they feel the need to defend themselves. When they do bite, they’re typically harmless because their venom doesn’t pose a danger to humans. While you may experience some uncomfortable symptoms, they should go away within a few days. If the symptoms don’t pass or you’re experiencing a more severe reaction, reach out to your healthcare provider.
