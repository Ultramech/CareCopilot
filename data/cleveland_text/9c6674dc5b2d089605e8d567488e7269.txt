Fregoli syndrome can make it feel like you’re in the audience watching a play. People change their costumes and voice pitch to act like someone else and hide their true identity. This happens because your brain has trouble identifying the people around you. As a result, you might feel anxious, agitated and paranoid because you think other people are deceiving you.
Fregoli syndrome is a type of delusional disorder or misidentification syndrome.
How rare is Fregoli syndrome?
Fregoli syndrome and other types of delusional disorders aren’t common. The exact prevalence around the world is unknown.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the features of Fregoli syndrome?
The features of Fregoli syndrome include the belief that:
A familiar person changes their appearance or is in disguise as a stranger or acquaintance.
The familiar person in disguise is following you.
The familiar person in disguise is trying to harm you.
The people you know are deceiving you.
These features are known as delusions of misidentification. They make it difficult to distinguish between a stranger and someone you know. Fregoli syndrome misidentification can also involve animals and inanimate objects.
While your feelings are real, the people you know aren’t shape-shifting, getting
cosmetic surgery
or changing costumes to trick or hurt you. Accepting this can be difficult because your beliefs and feelings are so strong. A healthcare provider can help you when you’re ready.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is Fregoli syndrome diagnosed?
A healthcare provider, usually a
psychiatrist
, will diagnose Fregoli syndrome after a mental health evaluation and testing. Your provider will learn more about your feelings, beliefs and symptoms.
Testing can determine a possible cause (like detecting a brain lesion, for example) or rule out conditions with similar symptoms. Your provider may order the following tests to make a diagnosis:
An
MRI
or a
CT scan
.
An electroencephalogram (
EEG
).
Management and Treatment

A healthcare provider may recommend a combination of the following to manage Fregoli syndrome symptoms:
Medications (
antipsychotics
,
antidepressants
and/or
antiseizure medications
).
Cognitive behavioral therapy
.
It’s common for your provider to adjust the dosage or type of medication they prescribe, either to treat Fregoli syndrome symptoms or its cause, especially if levodopa is the culprit. These changes help your provider create a treatment plan that’s specific to what your body needs to feel better, as there isn’t a one-size-fits-all treatment for Fregoli syndrome.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Watching a theatrical performance is usually an enjoyable experience. But when you feel like you’re a permanent audience member, paranoia and anxiety can take the lead role.
With Fregoli syndrome, it’s easy to misidentify someone. Others can make you feel alone and unsafe, like the people closest to you are trying to hurt you. The constant fear of deception can significantly impact your mental and physical health. And this can put yourself and those around you at risk of harm.
But a healthcare provider can offer a safe space for you to explain what’s going on. They can recommend treatment options so you can feel better and close the curtain on Fregoli syndrome.
