Radio Frequency (RF) Skin Tightening
During radio frequency (RF) skin tightening, providers use an electromagnetic device that generates heat to stimulate the production of collage, elastin and new skin cells. This nonsurgical facelift firms and lifts sagging skin. The results are temporary, but they’re similar to a surgical facelift.

How does radio frequency skin tightening work?
Radio frequency devices use safe levels of low-frequency electromagnetic waves to generate heat. This heat penetrates deep into your
skin’s layers
. There, it stimulates new skin cell production (regeneration). The treatment also stimulates the production of
collagen
and
elastin
. These proteins give skin cells more strength and flexibility. As a result, sagging skin regains its firm shape and feel.
How common is radio frequency (RF) skin tightening?
More than 188,000 Americans received some type of skin tightening procedure in 2020. This type of nonsurgical facelift works on all sexes and skin tones. And there’s very little risk of skin discoloration (
hyperpigmentation
). It’s most effective on younger people who are just starting to show signs of aging. It’s not as effective on severely sagging skin.

dermatologists

skin disease

What happens during radio frequency skin tightening?
Radio frequency skin tightening is an outpatient procedure. It takes about one hour, depending on the treatment area. You go home soon after the procedure.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Radio frequency (RF) skin tightening can give you a more youthful appearance without the need for a surgical procedure like a facelift. Heat from a radio frequency device penetrates deep into your skin. It stimulates the production of collagen, elastin and new skin cells. The procedure firms sagging skin, making you look younger. Your healthcare provider can discuss the different nonsurgical and surgical cosmetic treatments that can help you get the results you seek.
