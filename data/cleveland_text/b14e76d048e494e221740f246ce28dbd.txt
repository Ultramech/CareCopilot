What happens before a Sculptra injection?
Before a dermal filler procedure, you’ll meet with a healthcare provider who specializes in fillers. They’ll perform a consultation to learn more about you, including your:
Overall health and if you have any allergies.
Goals for the procedure.
Current medications, vitamins or supplements you take.
History of similar cosmetic procedures (if applicable).
During this consultation, your provider may:
Evaluate whether or not you’re healthy enough for the procedure.
Discuss types of fillers, including Sculptra.
Take photographs to compare how your skin looks before and after treatment.
Explain the risks, potential side effects or complications that could happen.
Schedule a date for the procedure.
Answer any questions you might have about the procedure.
What happens during a Sculptra injection?
Dermal fillers using Sculptra are nonsurgical cosmetic procedures that you’ll receive during an office visit. You’ll be awake during the procedure. The steps of a Sculptra injection include:
Your provider will clean the area of skin where you’ll get an injection.
They may give you a topical anesthetic to numb the area of your skin so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort.
They’ll inject filler underneath your skin with a small needle. You may feel some pressure but you shouldn’t feel pain.
What happens after a Sculptra injection?
When your provider completes the Sculptra injection, you’re free to go about your normal activities without interruption. You’ll want to avoid strenuous activities for a couple of days. There may be bruising or swelling at the injection site that will go away after a couple of days. If you feel sore, you can take over-the-counter
NSAIDs
as your provider advises. Within about a month of injection, you should start to notice that your skin looks plumper or fuller.

Some people with hip dips don’t like the indentation and choose to get dermal fillers like Sculptra to smooth out this area.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Sculptra is a safe cosmetic procedure to reduce deep wrinkles. You might be interested in Sculptra if you have recesses, indentations or fine lines that you want eliminated on your skin. Sculptra can last over two years, but it’s not a permanent cosmetic procedure, so you may need fillers every few years to maintain your results.
