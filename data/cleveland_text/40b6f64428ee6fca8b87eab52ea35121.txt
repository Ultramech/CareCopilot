What are plastic surgeon education requirements?
Plastic surgery training starts with traditional medical school to earn a doctor of medicine degree (MD). Another option is osteopathic education to earn a doctor of osteopathy degree (DO). Osteopathic doctors learn a holistic approach that considers a person’s mind, body and spirit.
After medical school, doctors complete a six-year plastic surgery residency. During this time, they learn general and plastic surgery techniques. Alternatively, many doctors complete a five-year general surgery residency and follow that with an additional three years of training with a focus on plastic surgery.

After their residency training, plastic surgeons may choose to complete a rigorous exam to become board certified. The American Board of Plastic Surgery is one organization that grants board certification. Once these requirements have been achieved, plastic surgeons may choose to pursue further training in one of several sub-specialties listed in the section below.
Plastic surgeons maintain board certification through a Continuous Certification Program. They also have to complete a certain number of continuing medical education (CME) credits each year to maintain their medical license.
What types of specialty training are available to plastic surgeons?
Plastic surgeons can pursue a one-year fellowship after residency to become subspecialists in:
Body contouring
.
Microsurgery
.
Craniofacial or craniomaxillofacial surgery.
Cosmetic surgery
.
Hand surgery.
Burn surgery.
Is a plastic surgeon the same as a cosmetic surgeon?
Cosmetic surgery and reconstructive surgery are both sub-specialties of plastic surgery. Reconstructive plastic surgeons treat people with medical issues affecting appearance, form or function. Cosmetic plastic surgeons enhance the appearance of physical features for aesthetic reasons rather than medical.
Cosmetic surgery is a part of all plastic surgeons’ training. Healthcare providers who wish to become full-time cosmetic surgeons sometimes complete extra training through additional fellowships.
Other healthcare providers may elect to seek certification in cosmetic surgery only. However, these individuals don’t receive formal plastic surgery training and aren’t certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.
What do plastic surgeons do?
Plastic surgeons use various techniques to treat severe injuries, improve function and restore a natural-looking appearance.
These include:
Microsurgery
involves the use of a microscope to help surgeons carry out complex procedures. You may need microsurgery to reconnect tiny blood vessels or nerves.
Prosthesis preparation
is for people who lose part of their body. Techniques involve preparing for a replacement (prosthesis). In some cases, it includes attaching a donor or human-made replacement. Prosthetics are used most commonly in
breast reconstruction
(breast implants), but may also be used in other forms of reconstruction.
Skin grafts
are sections of healthy skin that surgeons shave off and attach to a different area of your body. After surgery, the graft survives by connecting to existing blood vessels. Skin grafts help repair large wounds, including burns.
Flaps.
A flap uses a person’s own tissue to repair defects caused by cancer resection or trauma. Skin, fat and sometimes muscle are often moved from another area.
Free flap surgery (free tissue transfer)
is similar to skin flap surgery. However, the section of skin, fat and/or muscle is removed from its original blood supply and transferred to a different area of your body. Surgeons connect it to a new blood source near the implant site.
Tissue expansion
involves placing a balloon-like device under your skin and filling it with saline to slowly stretch or expand it. During a second procedure, surgeons remove the expander and use the skin to close a wound that covers a large area. Tissue expansion is often used in breast reconstruction.
Complex wound care
is for people with large or complex wounds. Plastic surgeons can sometimes use techniques to close the wound while minimizing scarring. They may use a variety of techniques, including microsurgery and skin grafts.

Blepharoplasty
removes excess skin, muscle and fatty tissue from eyelids.
