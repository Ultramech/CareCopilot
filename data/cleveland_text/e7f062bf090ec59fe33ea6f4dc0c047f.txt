Spleen Cancer
Spleen cancer is uncommon. Most spleen cancer develops when cancer in another part of your body metastasizes (spreads) to your spleen. Less often, it starts in your spleen. Healthcare providers may treat some spleen cancer with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Overview
What is spleen cancer?
This is a cancerous
tumor
in your
spleen
, the fist-sized organ that’s part of your
lymphatic system
. Spleen cancer is uncommon. It typically develops when
cancer
in another part of your body metastasizes (spreads) to your spleen. Less often, it starts in your spleen.

Types of spleen cancer
There are two spleen cancer types: primary and secondary:
Primary spleen cancers
, which start in your spleen, are very uncommon. The two primary spleen cancer subtypes are splenic
marginal zone lymphoma
and splenic
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
. Very rarely, people with spleen cancer have primary splenic
angiosarcoma
.
Secondary spleen cancers
are when cancer spreads to your spleen from another area of your body. For example, you may develop spleen cancer if you have a blood cancer like
leukemia
or
lymphoma
. Less frequently, cancers like
breast cancer
,
lung cancer
and
ovarian cancer
may spread to your spleen. Secondary spleen cancers are much more common than primary spleen cancers.
Symptoms and Causes
What are spleen cancer symptoms?
You may have spleen cancer without having symptoms. If you do have symptoms, the most common are:
Pain in your upper abdomen because your spleen is enlarged (
splenomegaly
).
Unexpected weight loss
.
Feeling weak.
Fever
.
Spleen cancer doesn’t happen often, so having certain symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you have it. For example,
mononucleosis
may make your spleen swell. That said, talk to a healthcare provider if you’re concerned about swelling in your upper belly, if you have a fever that lasts more than two weeks or have pain in the upper left part of your belly.

What causes spleen cancer?
Most of the time, spleen cancer happens when cancer from another area of your body invades your spleen. Less often, rare forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma develop in your spleen.
Risk factors
A risk factor is an experience or activity that increases the chance you’ll develop a specific medical condition. One general risk factor is when cancer from somewhere else in your body spreads to your spleen. You may increase your risk of splenic marginal zone lymphoma if you have
hepatitis C
or
autoimmune diseases
.
What are the complications of spleen cancer?
Left untreated, spleen cancer may make your spleen burst or rupture. A
ruptured spleen
can cause life-threatening internal bleeding and requires immediate medical attention.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is spleen cancer diagnosed?
Healthcare providers typically perform
biopsies
to diagnose spleen cancer. They may order a
peripheral blood smear test
, too. And they may also order imaging tests to see how cancer is affecting your spleen or if spleen cancer is spreading to another part of your body. Imaging tests may include:
Computed tomography (CT) scan
.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
.
Ultrasound
.
Management and Treatment
What are spleen cancer treatments?
Your treatment will depend on factors like:
Spleen cancer type.
Whether the cancer is primary or secondary. If you have secondary spleen cancer, treatment will focus on the cancer that spread to your spleen.
The
cancer stage
.
Your overall health.
Healthcare providers may do
splenectomies
to treat spleen cancer. Removing your spleen eliminates cancer in your spleen but isn’t treatment for other cancers that spread there.
People with primary spleen cancer like splenic primary diffuse B-cell lymphoma may receive treatments including:
Chemotherapy
.
Radiation therapy
.
Treatment side effects or complications
All surgeries involve some risk of infection or excessive bleeding. Sometimes, splenectomies cause serious infections. Your provider may recommend you have certain vaccinations before and after surgery that protect against
bacteria
likely to cause infection.
Common chemotherapy and radiation therapy
side effects
include:
Fatigue
.
Nausea and vomiting
.
Loss of appetite.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can spleen cancer be cured?
If cancer started in your spleen, surgery to remove your spleen may
cure
it. That may be a different situation if you have cancer that spread to your spleen from another part of your body. In that case, curing spleen cancer may depend on successful treatment of the original cancer.
What are spleen cancer survival rates?
One analysis of spleen cancer cases showed more than 83% of people with primary spleen cancer were alive five years after diagnosis. But spleen cancer survival rates can vary widely depending on many factors like:
Whether the cancer is primary or secondary.
The cancer stage at diagnosis.
Your overall health.

When you think about
survival rates
, it’s important to remember some rates are based on a few studies involving a relatively small group of people. That’s particularly true in spleen cancer, which is uncommon. If you have questions about your situation, ask your healthcare provider what you can expect.
Prevention
Can spleen cancer be prevented?
That depends. For example, experts believe having hepatitis C may increase your risk of developing primary spleen cancer. You can prevent hepatitis C by avoiding contact with infected
blood
, specifically by not sharing needles or syringes.
On the other hand, secondary spleen cancer happens when other kinds of cancer invade your spleen. In that case, preventing other cancers or early detection and treatment are the only ways to prevent spleen cancer.

How do I take care of myself?
If you’re living with spleen cancer, you’re probably living with cancer that spread to your spleen from another part of your body. Your healthcare provider may refer to this as
metastatic cancer
.
Being diagnosed with metastatic cancer comes with many challenges. These challenges vary from person to person, but you might:
Feel sad, angry or hopeless.
Feel overwhelmed because you have cancer in more than one place in your body.
Worry that treatment won’t work.
Worry that the cancer will get worse quickly.
Need help with daily routines.

If this is your situation, consider participating in a
cancer survivorship
program. Cancer survivorship programs help carry people through cancer, helping them live as long as they can and with the best possible quality of life.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Typically, spleen cancer happens because you have a type of lymphoma or other cancer that’s spread (metastasized) to your spleen. Living with metastatic cancer isn’t easy, in part because it often means you’ll need additional treatment. Healthcare providers may be able to treat spleen cancer, but curing it depends on whether there’s treatment for the original disease.
You may feel overwhelmed and worried about what’s next. If that’s your situation, talk to your healthcare provider about cancer survivorship programs for people like you who have metastatic cancer.
