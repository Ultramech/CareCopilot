Splenic Flexure Syndrome
Splenic flexure syndrome is a digestive disorder that happens when gas builds up in your splenic flexure. This is a small bend in your colon. The gas buildup can cause severe abdominal pain and bloating. You can manage your symptoms by changing what you eat.

Overview
What is splenic flexure syndrome?
Splenic flexure syndrome happens when
gas
coming from your stomach builds up in a section of your colon. This section is your
splenic flexure
, which is a sharp turn or bend in your colon. The condition is a type of
irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS). Splenic flexure syndrome isn’t a serious illness. But without treatment, it can cause severe upper abdominal pain that can affect your quality of life.

What are the symptoms of splenic flexure syndrome?
Splenic flexure symptoms may include:
Bloating
Fullness
Nausea
and
vomiting
Sharp pain in your
upper left abdomen
What causes splenic flexure syndrome?
Most people develop splenic flexure syndrome when gas builds up in their stomach. You can develop gas buildup if:
You swallow a lot of air (
aerophagia
) when you eat and drink. You’re more likely to have gas in your stomach if you eat or drink very fast. Chewing gum is another way you can swallow air.
You eat food and consume drinks with
carbohydrates
that your stomach and small intestine don’t digest.
Bacteria
in your large intestine break down the carbohydrates and release gas.
Gas from your stomach travels through your large intestine. It goes out through your anus (butthole) when you
fart
. Normally, gas can negotiate the curve of your splenic flexure. But too much gas can overwhelm this area of your colon. (Think what happens when a heavy rain sends water rushing toward a sharp bend in a river.)
The condition can also happen if you’re born with an unusually tight bend or curve in your colon.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose splenic flexure syndrome?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical examination
. They’ll ask about your symptoms. They may do the following tests:
Barium enema
Computed tomography (CT) scan
A provider may do other tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms.

Management and Treatment
How do you fix splenic flexure syndrome?
There’s no one way to treat this condition. Splenic flexure syndrome is a type of irritable bowel syndrome. For that reason, a healthcare provider may recommend some common IBS treatments like:
Avoiding high-fiber foods that cause gas
. Common culprits are veggies like broccoli, cauliflower and peas. Beans and lentils also cause gas.
Checking out the
low FODMAP diet
. This diet works by reducing certain hard-to-digest carbohydrates.
Cutting back on carbonated beverages
. Fizzy drinks can cause gas buildup in your stomach.
Slowing down on certain sweets
. Honey, corn syrup and high-fructose fruits, like apples and peaches, can be hard to digest.
Taking it slow while
eating
.
That way,
you don’t swallow a lot of air.
Your provider may ask you to keep a
food diary
. Tracking what you eat and drink can help them pinpoint what causes you to have gas. Knowing what to avoid can cure splenic flexure syndrome.

Prevention
Can splenic flexure syndrome be prevented?
Yes, it can. Changing what you eat reduces stomach gas. That can reduce the chance that you’ll have gas buildup in your splenic flexure.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to a provider if splenic flexure symptoms come back or get worse even though you changed what you eat.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Splenic flexure syndrome isn’t a serious illness. But symptoms like severe abdominal pain and bloating can make you feel miserable. Many conditions can cause symptoms that are like the ones you have with splenic flexure syndrome. It may take some time for healthcare providers to sort through your symptoms and develop a diagnosis. The good news is that changing what you eat can cure the condition.
