Alginates for GERD
Alginates are a compound found in seaweed that helps with symptoms of GERD. They work by forming a gel-like barrier between your stomach and esophagus, which prevents stomach acid from flowing backward. You can buy them over the counter.

Overview
What are alginates used for in GERD?
Alginates are a compound found in seaweed that can help
GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
symptoms. When alginates mix with your stomach acid, they create a gel-like barrier that keeps the acid from coming up your
esophagus
.

Your stomach acid should stay in your
stomach
. But if you have GERD, the acid in your stomach flows backward into your esophagus and throat. This can cause uncomfortable symptoms like
heartburn
and burping up food. Over time, GERD can damage the lining of your esophagus.
Alginates form a raft-like barrier between your stomach and esophagus. This special layer is light enough to float on top of your stomach acid, but strong enough to keep the acid down — so it doesn’t flow back up into your esophagus.
You shouldn’t dive into the water to get seaweed, though. There’s a process that companies use to clean and purify it before it’s used.
Treatment Details
What are the potential benefits and risks of alginates for GERD?
Alginates have been around for a long time to treat GERD, but
antacids
are more well-known.
The benefits of alginates are:

They’re generally safe for
women
who are
lactating
and/or
pregnant
, and children.
You can buy them over the counter.

They cause side effects like bloating or
constipation
.
They interact with the effectiveness of other medications you take for other conditions.

While alginates can be effective for GERD symptoms, they shouldn’t be used to treat esophageal erosions or ulcers caused by GERD or for
Barrett’s esophagus
.
If you have
kidney disease
, talk to your healthcare provider before taking alginates. Some brands include sodium as an ingredient, which may not be safe for you.
Can you buy alginates over the counter?
Yes. They come in several forms like chewables, powders and liquids. You can buy alginates online and at your local drugstore or grocery store.
Some different brand names of alginates you may see are Rennie

Recovery and Outlook
How effective are alginates for GERD?
One study
found that alginates are more effective than antacids at treating GERD. The same study found them to be slightly less effective than
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
and
histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)
.
Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between an antacid and an alginate?
Antacids work a little differently from alginates. Antacids neutralize the acid in your stomach so it doesn’t burn your esophagus. You can get antacids with alginates in them already or take antacids and alginates together. Both are over-the-counter medications.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
You probably wouldn’t have guessed that a compound in seaweed could be the answer to your GERD symptoms. Alginates aren’t as well-known as other treatments for GERD (like antacids), but they can be just as effective (or more effective) in easing your acid reflux. If you have GERD or chronic reflux, ask your healthcare provider if alginates are an option for you based on your health history and symptoms.
