Fibrous Dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia makes your body grow weaker fibrous tissue in your bones instead of healthy bone tissue. It can affect any bone in your body. Having fibrous dysplasia makes you more likely to experience bone fractures throughout your life.

What Is Fibrous Dysplasia?
Fibrous dysplasia is a rare bone condition that happens when abnormal fibrous (scar-like) tissue replaces healthy bone tissue. The condition weakens your
bones
and may increase your risk of
bone fractures
. Fibrous dysplasia (fI-bruhs-dis-play-zhee-uh) can affect any bone in your body. But it most commonly affects the:

Thigh bone (
femur
)
Shin bone (
tibia)
Ribs
Skull
(including your facial bones)
Upper arm (
humerus
)
Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder. That means it won’t spread to other bones.
Types of fibrous dysplasia
Healthcare providers classify fibrous dysplasia by the number of bones it affects:
Monostotic fibrous dysplasia affects one bone
Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia affects several bones
You may have polyostotic fibrous dysplasia if you have
McCune-Albright syndrome
. This rare syndrome affects your bones,
skin
and
endocrine system
.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of fibrous dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia may cause the following conditions and symptoms:
Broken bones
Bone pain
Changes in the shape of your bones
Painless, swollen area on your ribs
Curvature of the spine (
scoliosis
)
Bulging eyes
Jaw misalignment
Misaligned or misshapen
teeth
Nasal congestion
You can have fibrous dysplasia without having symptoms. Some people find out they have the condition when they have X-rays for an unrelated issue. People with fibrous dysplasia in one bone have fewer issues than if the condition affects several bones.
Fibrous dysplasia causes
This condition happens when the
GNAS1
gene
changes after
conception
. This
gene change
affects
osteoblasts
. These cells help your bones develop and grow. Experts don’t know what triggers this change. Fibrous dysplasia isn’t hereditary. That means you can’t pass the change on to your biological children.

Complications of fibrous dysplasia
The most common complication is that fibrous dysplasia increases the chance that you’ll break a bone. You may have issues with
hearing
or
vision
if it affects bones around your
eyes
or
ears
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
A healthcare provider will do a
physical exam
. If you have pain, they’ll carefully examine the area of your body that hurts. They’ll ask when you first noticed symptoms. Your provider may do the following tests:
Blood tests
or
urine tests
to check for high
enzyme
levels that could mean you have fibrous tissue growing in your body
Imaging tests like
X-rays
,
CT scans
or
MRI
s that may detect fibrous tissue on your bones, broken bones or changes in the shape of your bones
Biopsy
to remove a sample of the fibrous tissue or your healthy bone tissue for testing
Management and Treatment
How fibrous dysplasia is treated
Your treatment will depend on your symptoms and how the condition affects you. The most common fibrous dysplasia treatments are:
Observation
. You might not need any treatment other than follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. They’ll watch for any changes in your bone health.
Medication
. Providers may prescribe drugs that strengthen your bones and help prevent fractures.
Bracing
. Wearing braces can support your bones and help them grow correctly.
Surgery
. You may have surgery to treat broken bones, including
bone grafts
.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should talk to a healthcare provider if you have bone pain that doesn’t go away. If you have fibrous dysplasia, talk to your provider if you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or if it seems that treatments aren’t making a difference.
Fibrous dysplasia weakens your bones, so you’re more likely to break a bone. If you fall, get hit on a bone or are in a vehicle accident, go to the emergency room right away.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have fibrous dysplasia?
There’s no single answer to that question. Fibrous dysplasia affects people in different ways. But one thing is certain: fibrous dysplasia is a chronic condition. That means there’s no
cure
for it. There are treatments to reduce the ways the condition may affect you. If you have fibrous dysplasia, ask your healthcare provider what you may expect.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Fibrous dysplasia is a rare disorder that affects your bones. It may weaken them, so you’re more likely to break your bones. This condition doesn’t always cause symptoms. You may be surprised and concerned to learn you have it. There’s no cure for it. But fibrous dysplasia affects people in different ways. You may not need treatment. If you do, some treatments may limit the ways this condition may affect your life. If you have fibrous dysplasia, ask your healthcare provider what you can expect.
