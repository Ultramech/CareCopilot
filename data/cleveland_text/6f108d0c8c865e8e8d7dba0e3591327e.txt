Webbed Penis (Penoscrotal Webbing)
Your penis and scrotum are connected by skin. Sometimes, that skin is connected too high on your penis, creating a web-like appearance. Webbed penis is rare, but it’s usually present at birth (congenital). Sometimes it happens when too much skin is removed during circumcision. Surgery called scrotoplasty can treat it.

Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers confirm a webbed penis diagnosis?
Your healthcare provider can diagnose webbed penis through a physical examination.
Management and Treatment
How do you get rid of webbed penis?
Surgery on your scrotum (
scrotoplasty
) is the most common treatment for webbed penis. During the surgery, your healthcare provider cuts the skin connecting your scrotum to your penis, then reconnects it in the proper location using stitches (sutures).
This procedure creates a typical penis/scrotum angle. It also eliminates uncomfortable or painful erections and any cosmetic concerns. If you have penoscrotal webbing but you’re not bothered by it, there’s no need to pursue surgery.
Is treatment for acquired webbed penis the same as for congenital webbed penis?
Yes, scrotoplasty is the standard treatment for both congenital and acquired cases of webbed penis.
How long will it take to feel better after scrotoplasty?
You will feel discomfort or mild pain for at least three to five days after scrotoplasty. It takes several weeks to recover. During that time, you can expect mild scrotal swelling and discomfort. Follow steps for
incision care
. Use a support garment like a jockstrap to reduce movement.
When can I resume sexual activities after surgery for webbed penis?
Complete recovery and healing take about six weeks. During that time, avoid sexual intercourse so the wound can fully heal.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
A webbed penis is when skin from your scrotum connects to your penis at a higher location than it should. An erect penis pulls on that skin, creating an uncomfortable tightness or even pain. That can make sexual intercourse challenging or unpleasant. Scrotoplasty is a common surgery for treating webbed penis. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if scrotoplasty is right for you.
