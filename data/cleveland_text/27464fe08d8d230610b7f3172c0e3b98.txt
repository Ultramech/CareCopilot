Metastasis (Metastatic Cancer)
Metastasis happens when cancer cells break off from the original tumor, enter your bloodstream or lymphatic system, and then spread to other areas of your body. Doctors can’t cure most metastatic cancers, but treatment can help manage your symptoms.

Overview
Metastatic cancer spreads through your blood or lymph system.
What is metastasis?
Metastasis is when
cancer
spreads beyond the place where it started to other areas of your body. Nearly all cancers have the potential to metastasize. But whether they do depends on several factors — like the type, size and location of the primary
tumor
(where the cancer originated).

Policy
Metastases can occur in three ways. Cancer cells can:
Grow directly into the tissue surrounding the primary tumor.
Travel through your
bloodstream
to distant locations like other organs or your
bones
.
Move through your
lymphatic system
to nearby or distant
lymph nodes
.
Other names for metastasis include:
Metastatic cancer.
Stage IV (4) cancer.
Secondary cancer.
Cancer with mets (or mets cancer).
Which cancers metastasize?
Nearly all cancers can metastasize (spread). Some of the most common types include metastatic:
Breast cancer
.
Colorectal cancer
.
Esophageal cancer
.
Lung cancer
.
Ovarian cancer
.
Pancreatic cancer
.
Prostate cancer
.
Skin cancers
.
Stomach cancer
.
Uterine cancer
.
Where does cancer metastasize first?
Where cancer spreads during metastasis depends on the location of the primary (original) tumor. Some of the most common sites of metastases are the:
Adrenal glands
.
Bones
.
Brain
.
Liver
.
Lungs
.
Lymph nodes.
Peritoneum
.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of metastatic cancer?
Metastasis doesn’t always cause symptoms. Cancer cells can grow and spread gradually over many months or years. In some instances, it’s possible to have Stage IV (4) cancer and not know it.
General symptoms of metastasis may include:
Extreme
fatigue
.
Night sweats
.
Unexplained weight loss
.
Some signs of metastatic cancer depend on the location of the primary tumor and where the cancer cells spread. Depending on the type of metastasis you have, symptoms might include:
Advertisement
Bloating,
swollen belly
, decreased appetite, getting full quickly or
jaundice
(common in liver metastases).
Bone pain
or
fractures
(common in bone metastases).
Dizziness
, headaches and
seizures
(common in brain metastases).
Shortness of breath
(common in lung metastases).
What causes metastasis?
Metastasis happens when cancer cells break off from the original tumor and spread to other parts of your body. These cancer cells can travel through your bloodstream or lymph vessels.
Many factors can trigger metastasis, like:
A weakened
immune system
.
Hypoxia
(a lack of oxygen in your tissues).
Lactic acidosis
(a buildup of lactic acid in your blood).
Autophagy
(a type of
cell death
).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is metastatic cancer diagnosed?
Some people already have metastatic cancer at the time of their diagnosis. In these cases, a healthcare provider usually detects metastases during initial testing.
Other people develop metastases after completing treatment for non-metastatic cancer. During routine follow-ups, a healthcare provider checks for signs of
recurrence
(cancer that comes back after treatment).
What tests will be done to diagnose metastasis?
Your healthcare provider may use one or more of the following to diagnose metastatic cancer:
Biopsy
.
Blood tests
.
Bone scans
.
CT (computed tomography) scans
.
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans
.
PET (positron emission tomography) scans
.
Tumor marker
-based tests.
Ultrasound
.
X-rays
.
Management and Treatment
How is metastatic cancer treated?
Healthcare providers can treat metastasis based on where the cancer started. For example, if a person has breast cancer and the cancer spreads to their liver, their provider will still treat it the same way as breast cancer. This is because the cancer cells haven’t changed — they’re just living in a new place.
Metastatic cancer treatments may include:
Chemotherapy
.
Hormone therapy
.
Immunotherapy
.
Radiation therapy
.
Targeted therapy
.
Some metastases may require local targeted therapy to manage symptoms. For instance, if you have breast cancer that spreads to the bone and causes pain or fractures, your provider can treat and ease those symptoms with surgery or radiation to the bone.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have metastatic cancer?
Your healthcare provider will work closely with you during
cancer treatment
and beyond. You’ll likely have many medical visits and will need to make important decisions regarding your overall health. Be sure to lean on friends, family and your healthcare team for support.
Metastatic cancer life expectancy
In most cases, metastatic cancer isn’t
curable
. But treatment can slow tumor growth and ease many of your symptoms. It’s possible to live for several years with some types of cancer, even after metastasis. Some metastases are potentially curable, including melanoma and colon cancer.

Metastatic cancer survival rates
The five-year survival rate depends on the type of metastases you have. For example, the five-year survival rate for metastatic lung cancer is 9%. This means that 9% of people diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer are still alive five years later. Meanwhile, the five-year survival rate of metastatic breast cancer is 30% for
women
and 19% for men.
It’s important to understand that
survival rates
are only estimates. They can’t tell you how you’ll respond to treatment or how long you’ll live. Ask your healthcare provider about survival rates for your specific condition.
Prevention
Can metastasis be prevented?
You can’t always prevent cancer from spreading. But when providers can detect cancer earlier, a combination of surgery and
adjuvant therapy
might lower your risk for developing metastasis. Common adjuvant therapies include chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
Experts continue to research ways to slow, stop or prevent the spread of cancer cells. But sometimes, metastasis happens, despite doing all the right things. According to research, there aren’t any diets that make people more prone to cancer or prevent metastasis from happening.
If you have metastatic cancer, it’s important to know that it’s not your fault and that you haven’t done anything wrong.

How do I take care of myself?
A metastatic cancer diagnosis comes with many challenges. These challenges vary from person to person, but you might:
Feel sad, angry or hopeless.
Worry that treatment won’t work and that your cancer will get worse quickly.
Get tired of going to so many appointments and making so many important decisions.
Need help with daily routines.
Feel frustrated about the cost of your treatment.
Talking with a counselor or social worker can help you cope with these complicated emotions. Managing stress is also an important aspect of self-care. Try practicing
meditation
or mindfulness, or find other ways to reduce
stress
and
anxiety
.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should call your healthcare provider any time you develop new symptoms. Your cancer care team can adjust your treatment to meet your specific needs.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Learning about your condition can empower you to make informed decisions. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider:
Are there things I can do to improve my outlook?
What are my treatment options?
Are there clinical trial options I can explore?
Will
palliative care
continue even if I stop cancer treatments?
How often will I need to schedule follow-up appointments?
Do I need to consider
hospice
care?
Should I choose a person to make medical decisions for me when I’m unable to make them for myself?
What legal documents should I have in place?
Can you recommend resources to help me cope with my diagnosis?

A note from Cleveland Clinic
A metastatic cancer diagnosis — when cancer has spread from its original source to elsewhere in your body — is one of the scariest things you may ever encounter. If you recently learned that you have metastasis, you’re probably feeling a lot of complicated emotions. While most metastatic cancers aren’t curable, there are treatments that can ease your symptoms and prolong your life. Ask your healthcare provider for resources and consider joining a local support group. Talking with other people who are going through the same thing can offer healing on your journey.
