What causes yellow fever?
Yellow fever is caused by a virus that’s spread by certain kinds of mosquitoes.
How does yellow fever spread?
Yellow fever is spread by specific types of mosquitoes found in tropical and subtropical Africa (Saharan Africa) and South America. The infection spreads when the infected mosquito bites a person.
Is yellow fever contagious?
You can’t spread yellow fever to another person if you have it. For instance, you can’t spread it by coughing or kissing. However, if you are infected, a mosquito can bite you and then infect someone else.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is yellow fever diagnosed?
If you’ve been to any area that has yellow fever and you develop any symptoms, you should see your healthcare provider immediately. In addition to asking you about your symptoms and the places that you’ve visited, your provider will order tests to find out if the virus is in your blood.
Management and Treatment
Is there a cure for yellow fever?
No, there’s no cure or treatment for yellow fever. That’s why it’s so important to get the vaccine and to avoid mosquitoes.
Your healthcare provider may advise you to get a lot of rest and drink lots of fluids to feel better. If you need to take a pain reliever, avoid those which can cause bleeding, such as aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
If you have a more serious form of yellow fever, you should be admitted to a hospital.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for someone with yellow fever?
If you have a less severe form of yellow fever, you’ll probably recover from your symptoms in about seven days. You may feel tired and weak for much longer than a week. After you recover, you’ll have immunity to yellow fever.
Prevention
How can I prevent yellow fever?
If you’ll be spending time in any area known to have yellow fever, get the vaccine about three to four weeks before going on your trip. For most people, a single dose provides lifelong protection. Other tips include:
Use a mosquito repellent with DEET.
Wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts and socks. It’s best if you wear clothing that’s treated to repel mosquitoes.
Consider using a bed net if the lodging doesn’t have air conditioning or screens on the windows.
Avoid being outside during times when mosquitoes are active. In most cases, this means dusk to dawn, but one of the mosquitoes that spread yellow fever feeds during the daytime.
If you’ve been diagnosed with yellow fever, continue to cover up. You don’t want a mosquito to bite you and then bite someone else.

Additional Common Questions
Is yellow fever the same as malaria?
Yellow fever is not the same disease as
malaria
, but they do have some things in common:
They are both spread by mosquitoes.
They both cause fever and other flu-like symptoms.
They both can cause jaundice, severe sickness and even death.
There are also significant differences between malaria and yellow fever, such as:
Malaria is caused by a parasite, while yellow fever is caused by a virus.
The types of mosquitoes that spread malaria are different than the mosquitoes that spread yellow fever.
There is a vaccine to prevent yellow fever, but no vaccine to prevent malaria. If you’re traveling to an area with malaria, talk to your provider about preventative medications for malaria.
How long did the yellow fever pandemic in the United States last?
There were outbreaks of yellow fever in the U.S. at various times, starting in the 1600s. One of the worst outbreaks happened in Philadelphia in 1793. About 10% of the population of the city died from yellow fever. While there were other outbreaks in the U.S., the last major outbreak of yellow fever happened in New Orleans in 1905.
Why is yellow fever called yellow fever?
The “yellow” in yellow fever refers to the color of your skin if you have jaundice. The infection also usually comes with fever. Thus, the condition was called yellow fever.

Yellow fever isn’t a disease of the past.
