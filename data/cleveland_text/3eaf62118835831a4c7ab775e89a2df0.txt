X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia
X-Linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a condition caused by a mutation in your BTK gene. The gene is passed on from a parent to their child. It causes parts of your immune system to be underdeveloped, which makes you get sick often. It mostly affects males. Treatment for XLA includes antibody infusions.

Overview
What is X-linked agammaglobulinemia?
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (pronounced “ay-ga-muh-glaa-byou-luh-NEE-mee-uh”), or XLA, is a genetic condition where your body doesn’t make enough mature
B-cells
. B-cells are an important part of your immune system. They make proteins (
antibodies
) that help you fight off illnesses. People with XLA aren’t able to fight off illnesses easily and get sick often.

Because B-cells are important for developing certain immune system tissues, people with XLA often have underdeveloped or absent
lymph nodes
, tonsils and adenoids. Because of how you inherit it, it almost always affects
males
.
XLA is also called:
Bruton’s agammaglobulinemia.
Congenital agammaglobulinemia.
Hypogammaglobulinemia.
Hypogammaglobulinemia
is also a name used for
common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
, a condition similar to XLA. CVID is usually less severe and typically not diagnosed until adulthood. Providers typically diagnose people with XLA before the age of 1 or as young children.
What’s the difference between X-linked agammaglobulinemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)?
The difference between X-linked agammaglobulinemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is that XLA affects your B-cells, and SCID affects your
T-cells
. Both are genetic conditions that affect your immune system and make you get sick frequently.
How common is X-linked agammaglobulinemia?
X-linked agammaglobulinemia is rare. It’s more common in males. Approximately 1 in 200,000 males are born with XLA.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of X-linked agammaglobulinemia?
People with X-linked agammaglobulinemia usually have small or missing lymph nodes, tonsils and adenoids due to their underdeveloped immune systems. They experience frequent
bacterial infections
in childhood, including:
Bronchitis.
Ear infections (otitis media).
Sinusitis.
Pneumonia.
Gastrointestinal infections
.

Children with XLA usually aren’t more likely to get recurrent viral or fungal infections, like
cytomegalovirus
,
RSV
or
the flu.
What causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia?
XLA is a genetic illness you inherit from one or both biological parents. A change, or mutation, in your
BTK
gene causes it. This gene gives the instructions that tell your body how to make B-cells. B-cells make antibodies, an important part of your immune system that fights illness.
Changes in your
BTK
gene mean you can’t fight off illness the same way someone without the mutation can. This means you get sick frequently, sometimes with life-threatening illnesses.
What does X-linked mean?
We all get two sets of
genes
— one from each parent — in sets called chromosomes. Genes give our bodies instructions on how to make the proteins that keep our bodies working. Often, if there’s a change in one gene, having a second copy makes up for it, so your body can still function properly.
Males have mismatched sex chromosomes. They have one X and one Y. If one of these genes has a mutation, they don’t have another one to compensate for it. The BTK gene is on the X chromosome (X-linked). If they have a mutation in their BTK, they’ll have XLA.
Females have two X chromosomes. If they have one X chromosome with the mutation that causes XLA, they can still make enough mature B-cells because they have another functioning copy of BTK.
What are the risk factors for X-linked agammaglobulinemia?
Having a family history of XLA is the only known risk factor.
Can girls have XLA?
Yes, it’s possible. But both parents would have to carry an X chromosome with the mutated
BTK
gene. Females can be carriers of the gene mutation and pass it on to their children, who might have XLA.
What are the complications of XLA?
Complications of X-linked agammaglobulinemia include:
Chronic lung disease.
Infections that spread to other parts of your body, like your blood or your brain.
Possible increased risk of certain cancers.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is X-linked agammaglobulinemia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider can perform blood tests to determine whether you or your child have XLA. If test results show a low level of B-cells or antibodies, they’ll do
genetic testing
to look for DNA changes.
Management and Treatment
How is X-linked agammaglobulinemia treated?
There’s no cure for XLA. But treatments can help you or your child avoid serious illness. They include:
Replacement immunoglobulins (RIgG)
. Your healthcare provider gives you donor antibodies in a vein. You’ll need this treatment at least once per month.
Proactive treatment of infections
. Your provider will treat bacterial infections with antibiotics as soon as they think you’re sick.
Avoiding live vaccinations
. People with XLA can’t get live vaccines. These can make you sick or even be fatal. This includes the
MMR
,
chickenpox (varicella)
and oral polio vaccines.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have X-linked agammaglobulinemia?
People with XLA need treatment for the rest of their lives so they’re less vulnerable to illness. They’ll need to work closely with their healthcare provider to treat any illnesses as soon as possible. You or your child can expect to miss more days of school and work due to illness than others.
How long do people with X-linked agammaglobulinemia live?
Thanks to advances in treatment, people with XLA live into adulthood in developed countries like the U.S. In still-developing countries, getting a diagnosis and treatment is much harder. This usually means children with XLA don’t live as long.
Prevention
Can X-linked agammaglobulinemia be prevented?
If you’re concerned about XLA, a healthcare provider can
screen you for genetic conditions
you could pass on to your child. If you’re a carrier of the mutation that causes XLA, you have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to a child. Any male children would have XLA. If you have XLA, your female children would be carriers. A
genetic counselor
or the provider who ordered the testing can advise you on your options if you’re a carrier or have XLA.
Living With
How do I take care of myself?
The best way to take care of yourself with XLA is to prioritize your care. Keep appointments with your provider, and make sure you can recognize signs of an infection. Ask your provider what to do if you have symptoms of an infection.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to a healthcare provider if:
Your child gets sick from a live vaccine (this includes the MMR vaccine and chickenpox vaccine).
Your child frequently gets sick with bacterial infections.
You frequently get sick with bacterial infections.
A provider can tell you whether they need to look into it more.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask a healthcare provider:
What signs and symptoms of infection should I look for?
What should I do if I think I or my child have an infection?
What are the treatment options?
How often do I or my child need treatment?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s common for kids to get sick frequently. But if your child often gets bacterial infections, something more might be going on. Talk to your provider about concerns you have. Getting a diagnosis and treatment early leads to the best possible outcomes.
If you’re living with XLA — a genetic condition where your body doesn’t make enough mature B-cells — follow your healthcare provider’s guidance about when you may need care. It’s important that you can recognize signs of an infection so you can get treated as soon as possible.
