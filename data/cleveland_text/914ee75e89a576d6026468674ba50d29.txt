Radiation Therapy Side Effects
Most people who receive radiation therapy treatment experience side effects. This happens when healthy cells are exposed to the radiation used to kill cancer cells. Fatigue is the most common side effect of radiation therapy. Other side effects depend on the type of cancer you have and where the tumor is located in your body.

Why does radiation therapy cause side effects?
Side effects are common when you’re receiving
radiation therapy
for cancer. Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) directs powerful energy (usually X-rays) toward
tumors
, destroying cancer cells. Healthcare providers who specialize in radiation therapy (
radiation oncologists
) take care to design treatment that delivers maximum damage to cancer cells without exposing healthy cells to radiation.

Still, sometimes the radiation impacts healthy cells near the tumor. Unlike
cancer
cells, healthy cells can repair themselves after damage from radiation. In the meantime, the damage can cause side effects.
No one can be certain which exact side effects you’ll experience or their severity. Your provider is your best resource for explaining what changes to look for in your body during
cancer treatment
. But there are general radiation side effects to know about that can help you prepare.
What are common side effects of radiation therapy?
The most common side effect of radiation therapy is
fatigue
. Mild or moderate fatigue (tiredness that doesn’t improve with rest) affects many people who get radiation therapy.
Other common side effects include:
Skin
changes
: Skin at the treatment site may redden (on light skin tones), darken (on dark skin tones), blister, peel or itch (
radiation dermatitis
). The changes may remind you of a
sunburn
.
Hair loss
: Radiation therapy can cause hair loss at the treatment site. Radiation to your head (for brain cancer and some head and neck cancers) may lead to
hair loss on your scalp
.
Decreased blood cells
:
Radiation therapy can cause lower
blood
cell counts.
These side effects are usually short-term and gradually improve after treatment. But they can be long-lasting for some people.

Brain
.
Head and neck.
Chest.
Breast

Pelvis.
Brain
Radiation therapy for
brain cancer

head and neck cancers
can impact the structures that help you taste, smell, eat and speak. Side effects may include:

When do side effects start?
Radiation therapy side effects usually start within the first few weeks of treatment. You may notice some within the first few days. Sometimes, though, side effects don’t show up until several weeks into radiation therapy or a few weeks after treatment is over.
Many people experience different timelines for these side effects. Radiation therapy side effects typically increase as treatment progresses.
How long do side effects last?
Side effects of radiation therapy typically start to improve the first few weeks after treatment. Common side effects, like fatigue, tend to go away within the first few months afterward. It takes hair about two to three months to grow back after radiotherapy for brain or head and neck cancers.
Sometimes, side effects of radiation therapy may linger and become permanent. Or they don’t appear until weeks, months or even years after radiation ends. Much depends on how strong your dose is and which part of your body is receiving the treatment.

It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the risks of long-term side effects based on your diagnosis and the type of radiation therapy you’re getting.
How do I manage radiation therapy side effects?
Many of the steps you can take to manage related
chemotherapy side effects
also work for managing radiation therapy side effects.
Here are some general tips to keep in mind:
Allow yourself time to rest
. Know that you likely won’t be able to “power through” radiation fatigue. Give yourself some grace and slow down when you need to. Plan activities and light exercise around the times of day when you feel the least exhausted.
Take extra care of your skin and hair
. Apply a sunscreen of SPF of 30 or more when you go outside if you’re getting radiation to your head and neck. Wash your skin and hair with lukewarm water and mild soap, and pat dry. Avoid using skin care products with harsh chemicals.
Prepare for changes to meals and snacks
. To prevent digestion issues, you may need to opt for several smaller meals a day instead of three large ones. You may need to choose blander foods than you’re used to. Working with a
dietitian
can help you manage planning meals and snacks.
Prioritize your mental health
. Care for your mind by
getting enough sleep
and trying
stress
-reduction techniques, like meditation. Working with a
psychologist
or
therapist
can help you manage cognitive (thinking) difficulties and process the challenges of living with cancer.
Plan for potential changes to your sex life and fertility
. You may need treatments to help manage the sexual side effects of radiotherapy. Your provider may be able to connect you with resources to help you have a baby after treatment.
Take medications as needed
. Your healthcare provider may recommend medications to relieve radiation side effects. Depending on your side effects, they may prescribe drugs to prevent radiation-related side effects.
Connect with specialists as needed
. Dietitians and mental health specialists may be important additions to your care team during radiation therapy. In addition, you may benefit from
palliative care
. This type of care can help ease cancer symptoms and treatment side effects.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Planning for what to expect during radiation therapy can feel overwhelming. In addition to the unknowns of a cancer diagnosis, treatment comes with its own set of unknowns — like potential side effects. No one can predict exactly what your experience will be like.
But we do know this: Radiation technology is more precise than ever. It does an excellent job of destroying cancer cells without exposing surrounding tissue to harmful doses of radiation. Less exposure to healthy cells means fewer side effects. Ask your healthcare provider which changes you’ll most likely experience based on your diagnosis and treatment plan. They can describe which side effects to look out for. And they can recommend treatments and management strategies that can help.
