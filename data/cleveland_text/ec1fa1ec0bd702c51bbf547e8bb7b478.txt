How do you use prescription skin care?
Many prescription skin care products are creams or gels that you apply directly to your skin. Usually, you use these creams a few times a week. Other medications are pills that you swallow one or more times a day.

Risks / Benefits
What are the advantages of prescription skin care?
The primary advantage of prescription skin care is its strength and effectiveness. Prescription-grade products can work their way past the surface layers of skin into the dermis (deeper skin layer).
When your skin care products reach these deeper layers of skin, they work better. The dermis contains collagen, elastin and new skin. These types of skin cells make your complexion appear brighter, firmer and more youthful.
If you have male-pattern hair loss, prescription products are some of the only proven treatments. For example, finasteride is one of only a few FDA-approved products to grow hair in men. Some prescription products, such as Rogaine® (minoxidil), eventually become available over-the-counter.
What are the risks or complications of prescription skin care?
Because prescription skin care products are such strong formulations, they can cause side effects. While using prescription skin care, you might experience:
Dryness
.
Increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Peeling
.
Skin “purging,” or periods of increased breakouts.
Stinging.
Swelling.
Tightness.
Is prescription skin care safe when you are pregnant?
Many prescription skin care products are not safe to use while you are pregnant or nursing. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider if there is a possibility that you are pregnant.
Can I combine nonprescription and prescription skin care?
Usually, a dermatologist prescribes one prescription skin care product to treat a specific condition, like acne. You can incorporate this product into a skin care routine with nonprescription cleansers and moisturizers.
Because many prescription products can cause dryness, choose a gentle cleanser and moisturizing cream. Avoid combining prescription and over-the-counter products designed to treat the same condition. For example, if your dermatologist prescribed an acne cream, avoid also using an over-the-counter cleanser that targets acne.
Recovery and Outlook
How long does it take for prescription skin care to work?
In general, you will start to see results from oral medications in 2 to 3 weeks. Topical prescription skin care can take up to six weeks to show results.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should call your healthcare provider if any skin care products cause:
Extreme swelling, especially of the tongue or lips.
Hives
.
Severe
rash
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Prescription skin care products can improve the look of your skin. They can also treat specific conditions such as eczema or hair loss. Many people experience excellent results from prescription skin care. For most people, these products have no significant side effects. But many prescription products are not safe to use during pregnancy. If you have tried over-the-counter skin care products without success, speak with a healthcare provider about prescription options.
