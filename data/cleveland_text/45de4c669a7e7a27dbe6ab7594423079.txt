Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency
Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is a rare genetic disorder that causes your red blood cells to break down faster than normal. It can lead to hemolytic anemia and cause symptoms like fatigue, weakness and a rapid heartbeat. Your healthcare provider can recommend treatments to manage your condition based on how severe your symptoms are.

What Is Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency?
Pyruvate kinase (pronounced “pie-ROO-vate KYE-nace”) deficiency is a rare
genetic disorder
that causes your red blood cells to break down too fast. Pyruvate kinase is an
enzyme
that your red blood cells need to make energy and survive. When you don’t have enough of it (deficiency), your red blood cells break down before your body can make new ones to replace them.

Your
red blood cells
carry oxygen throughout your body. Having too few red blood cells because of a pyruvate kinase deficiency means your body’s other cells may not get enough oxygen. As a result, you may have symptoms of
anemia
.
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a condition you’re born with that lasts forever. This means you’ll need lifelong care from a
hematologist
(blood doctor). But symptoms vary from person to person.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of pyruvate kinase deficiency
Anemia symptoms are common with PK deficiency. They include:
F
atigue
(weakness and extreme tiredness)
Rapid heartbeat
Shortness of breath
Pale skin
Dizziness
Headaches
Other
signs
of PK deficiency happen when the waste products from destroyed red blood cells build up in your body. Signs include:
Jaundice
(yellowish skin and yellow whites of your eyes)
An
enlarged spleen
Dark-colored pee (urine)
What is the age of onset for pyruvate kinase deficiency?
A PK deficiency is present at birth. But the timing when symptoms become noticeable depends on how severe your condition is.
For instance, newborns with noticeable symptoms often need lifesaving treatment. Infants may be fussy and have trouble feeding, while children may have low energy. Adults may not notice symptoms until a health event stresses their body. Examples include
pregnancy
, an infection or injury.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency causes
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited genetic disorder related to the
PKLR
gene. Think of your genes as the instructions that tell your cells what to do. Your
PKLR
gene tells your red blood cells how to make the enzyme pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase helps your red blood cells make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is their primary energy source.
With PK deficiency, a variation (error) in your
PKLR
gene prevents your red blood cells from making enough pyruvate kinase. As a result, your red blood cells can’t make the ATP they need to thrive. Instead, they break down too soon, leaving you with low red blood cells. This is called
hemolytic anemia
.
Autosomal recessive inheritance
You have to inherit two faulty
PKLR
genes to have PK deficiency. You inherit one from each biological parent. This is called
autosomal recessive inheritance
. Each parent has one normal
PKLR
gene and one faulty
PKLR
gene. Unless they’ve received genetic testing, they won’t know that they carry a faulty
PKLR
gene that they can pass along to their children.
There’s a 1 in 4 (25%) chance that both parents will pass the faulty
PKLR
gene to their child, causing a pyruvate kinase deficiency.
Risk factors
Since PK deficiency is passed from parents to their biological children, it affects some populations more than others. Healthcare providers most commonly diagnose it in people of northern European descent. It’s more widespread in certain Amish communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
How to lower your risk
You can’t prevent conditions you inherit. But you can check your risk of having a child with a pyruvate kinase deficiency. If you or your partner has a family history of this disorder, it may be a good idea to speak with a
genetics counselor
. They can explain
DNA tests
that may be available. They can walk you through possible outcomes during pregnancy.
Complications of this condition
Some people don’t realize they have a pyruvate kinase deficiency until they develop complications, like:
Gallstones
Iron overload
Leg ulcers
Pulmonary hypertension
Weakened bones (which increase your risk of
broken bones
and
osteoporosis
in older age)
Pregnancy complications
, including
miscarriage
and
preterm birth
Pregnancy can stress your body in ways that may trigger or intensify PK deficiency symptoms. This can impact the fetus. But pregnancy complications are rare. If you’re pregnant, your pregnancy providers will work with your hematologist to keep you and the fetus safe.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Signs of pyruvate kinase deficiency in a fetus may show up during a
prenatal ultrasound
. If your pregnancy care provider sees warning signs, they may test for pyruvate kinase deficiency. One sign is fluid buildup in the fetus’s body (hydrops fetalis).
If you or your child experiences symptoms of PK deficiency, a healthcare provider will order
blood tests
. These tests will check for:

Anemia
. Your provider will see if you have hemolytic anemia. Lots of conditions can cause anemia. Blood tests will help your provider rule those out.
Reduced pyruvate kinase activity
. Biochemical tests can measure how active your pyruvate kinase enzyme is. It’s less active with pyruvate kinase deficiency.
The
PKLR
gene mutation
. Molecular tests can find errors in the
PKLR
gene that cause the disorder.
Management and Treatment
How is pyruvate kinase deficiency treated?
Treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are and when you’re diagnosed.
Fetuses and newborns
Fetuses and newborns with pyruvate kinase deficiency may need lifesaving transfusions and treatments, like:
Intrauterine fetal transfusion
. A fetus with PK deficiency may need treatment before birth. A healthcare provider injects red blood cells from a donor into the fetus during this procedure.
Phototherapy
.
Phototherapy
helps your newborn’s body break down
bilirubin
. Bilirubin is a waste product of destroyed red blood cells. Too much of it can cause
jaundice
.
Exchange transfusion
. Newborns with severe jaundice may need an exchange transfusion. Their provider will replace their blood with a donor’s blood.
Infants, children and adults
Treatments can manage anemia symptoms and prevent complications of PK deficiency. They include:
Blood transfusions
. You may need lifelong
blood transfusions
to boost your low red blood cells. Some people who need regular transfusions as children find they no longer need them as adults.
Mitapivat
(Pyrukynd®). This
medicine
treats pyruvate kinase deficiency and hemolytic anemia in adults. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it in 2022.
Folic acid supplements
. Folic acid helps your body make red blood cells. You may need to take
supplements
if you’re not getting enough from the foods you eat.
Iron chelation
. Too much iron may build up in your body. It can happen because of the condition itself or from regular blood transfusions.
Iron chelation
gets rid of excess iron.
Spleen removal
. Your
spleen
stores destroyed red blood cells. It may get too big if you have a pyruvate kinase deficiency. If this happens, a provider may need to
remove it
.
Gallbladder removal
. You may develop gallstones with a pyruvate kinase deficiency. If they cause problems, your provider may recommend
removing your gallbladder
.

Researchers are testing new treatments, including:
Stem cell transplant
. During this procedure, you receive
stem cells
from a donor that eventually mature into healthy red blood cells.
Gene therapy
. Your healthcare provider replaces the faulty gene that causes pyruvate kinase deficiency with a healthy gene.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You’ll need regular checkups with your hematologist to check your red blood cell levels. They’ll also test for complications, like too much iron in your body.
They’ll let you know the follow-up care you need based on your condition.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
Your experience depends on your symptoms and treatments. Potential complications of a PK deficiency shape your experience, too. Also, your experience can change over your lifetime. For example, children who need regular blood transfusions may not need them as adults. An adult may not realize there’s an issue until a major health event triggers symptoms.
Your healthcare provider is your best resource for explaining what a pyruvate kinase deficiency means for your long-term health.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your healthcare provider will monitor you closely if you have PK deficiency. You may need frequent tests to ensure you have enough red blood cells. You may need blood transfusions to prevent severe anemia symptoms. Or you may not need treatment. There’s no set outcome when it comes to your experience. The most important thing is getting diagnosed so that you’re under a specialist’s care. Your red blood cells are your lifeblood. It’s important that you have enough of them to keep feeling your best.
