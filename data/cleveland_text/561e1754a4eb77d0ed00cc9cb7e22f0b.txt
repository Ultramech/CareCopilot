Urethral syndrome is a condition that causes irritation of your
urethra
. This is the tube connecting your bladder to the outside of your body. Your urethra carries urine (pee) and semen (sperm) away from your body.

Other names for urethral syndrome include:
Abacterial cystitis.
Frequency-dysuria syndrome.
Symptomatic abacteriuria.
Urethral pain syndrome (UPS).
Urethral syndrome symptoms are similar to those of other conditions. They may look the same as symptoms seen in urinary tract infections and urethritis. But unlike these conditions, viral and bacterial infections don’t cause urethral syndrome. Several factors can result in urethral syndrome, which can make it difficult for healthcare providers to identify the exact cause.
Who might have urethral syndrome?
People of any age, race or sex might have urethral syndrome. But
females
have this condition more commonly than males, and it affects those ages 30 to 50 the most. Healthcare providers diagnose urethral syndrome most often in people who are white.
How common is urethral syndrome?
Up to 25% of patients who see a healthcare provider with symptoms in their lower urinary tract may have urethral syndrome.
What is the difference between urethral syndrome and urethritis?
Bacterial or viral infections cause urethritis, including
nongonococcal urethritis in men
. But urethral syndrome doesn’t come from an infection. If an infection isn’t causing your symptoms, your provider may suspect urethral syndrome.
Symptoms and Causes
