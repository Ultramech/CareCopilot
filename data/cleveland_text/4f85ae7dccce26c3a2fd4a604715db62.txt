Alpha-Blockers
Alpha-blockers are medications that mainly treat high blood pressure. You may also take them for certain conditions that affect your circulatory system or prostate or for certain types of tumors. Alpha-blockers prevent cells from taking certain actions, like tightening blood vessels.

Overview
What are alpha-blockers?
Alpha-blockers are medications that treat
high blood pressure
. They attach to alpha-receptors on cells to keep them from performing an action.

Common examples of alpha-blockers for high blood pressure include doxazosin, prazosin and terazosin.
Healthcare providers commonly prescribe alpha-blockers for several conditions, like an enlarged prostate. Other names for alpha-blockers are:
Alpha adrenergic blockers or antagonists
Alpha-antagonists
Alpha-adrenoceptor blockers
Types of alpha-receptors
There are two types of alpha receptors:
Alpha-1 receptors
are in
blood vessels
, especially in your skin, kidneys, digestive organs and brain. They’re also in your prostate, ureters and eye muscles. They make blood vessels tighten, increasing
blood pressure
.
Alpha-2 receptors
are mostly in your brain and nerve endings that communicate with other nerves or blood vessels. They’re also in your pancreas, fat cells and blood vessels. They slow your nervous system to keep everything calm.
Types of alpha-blockers
There are two types of alpha-blockers — selective and non-selective. Both can affect your blood pressure.
Selective alpha blockers
target specific alpha-1 receptors to decrease your blood pressure or relax muscles. Examples include:
Alfuzosin
Doxazosin
Prazosin
Silodosin
Tamsulosin
Terazosin
Non-selective blockers
target both alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors. They work more broadly but have more side effects. Because they also block alpha-2 receptors, they increase the amount of norepinephrine — a stress hormone — in your system. This increases your blood pressure and heart rate and can make you feel jittery. Examples include
phenoxybenzamine
and phentolamine.

Other medical conditions an alpha-blocker can treat
Besides high blood pressure, alpha-blockers can help with:
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), an enlarged prostate that makes it hard to pee
Tumors
that can create extra
adrenaline
and
norepinephrine
Skin at risk from norepinephrine leaking out of your blood vessels and into nearby tissue
Reversal of the effects of some local
anesthetics
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Raynaud’s phenomenon
Prostatitis
(inflammation)
Chronic pelvic pain syndrome
Kidney stones
stuck in your ureters (tubes between your
kidneys
and bladder)
Symptoms from
ureteral stents
Treatment Details
How long will I need alpha-blockers?
For conditions like high blood pressure or benign prostate hyperplasia, it’s common to take an alpha-blocker long-term. For other conditions, you might only need to take them short-term. Your healthcare provider will explain options to you and help you decide what works best for you. They can tell you how long you’ll need to follow that course of treatment.
Depending on the medication and the condition you have, you can take some alpha-blockers long-term. Others are meant for short-term use.
You should never stop taking an alpha-blocker without talking to your healthcare provider. That’s because suddenly stopping them can cause serious complications. Some of these can be severe or even life-threatening.
Depending on why you take an alpha-blocker, your provider may tell you to stop taking them if:
You lower your blood pressure through physical activity and nutritious foods so that you no longer need medicine to manage it
You have a medical procedure (like
prostate removal
) that removes your need for an alpha-blocker
You switch to another medicine that isn’t an alpha-blocker but still has the same effect
What are the potential benefits and risks of this treatment?
Alpha-blockers can offer a treatment option that avoids surgery for certain conditions. But like other medicines, alpha-blockers have side effects.
Selective alpha-1-blocking medications often cause these side effects:
Low blood pressure (hypotension)
First-dose effect (a much stronger effect on blood pressure at first than later doses)
Dizziness
Priapism
, an erection that lasts four or more hours
Non-selective alpha-blockers may cause these side effects:
Weakness
Fast heartbeat
Muscle tremors
Some alpha-blocker medications may interact with alcohol, citrus juices or other foods. Alpha-blockers can also
interact
with many other medicines. Effects can vary from person to person. Your healthcare provider is the best source of information on how alpha-blockers are most likely to affect you.
Who should not take alpha-blockers?
There are several health concerns (contraindications) that can prevent you from taking alpha-blockers. These include:

Cataract surgery
: Because alpha-blockers affect the pupils in your eyes, they can cause complications during cataract surgery. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a common example of this.
Breastfeeding
: When breastfeeding, avoid taking non-selective alpha-blockers.
History of
orthostatic hypotension
: Taking alpha-blockers can make this condition worse.
Erectile dysfunction
medications
: In some cases, certain erectile dysfunction medicines can interact with alpha-blockers.
Kidney disease, circulatory diseases or
respiratory infections
: Non-selective alpha-blockers may not be an option if you have one or more of these conditions.

Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better?
Selective alpha-1 blockers can relieve symptoms in a few days.
Is there anything I can do to make this treatment easier on me?
Yes. Take your first dose of a selective alpha-1-blocker right before you go to bed. The effect of the first dose can be strong and can cause orthostatic hypotension. This means your blood pressure drops quickly when you stand up.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
In general, you should contact your provider if you have any sudden changes in your symptoms, especially when they keep you from your regular activities.
You should seek medical care right away if you have any of these:
Fainting or passing out
Chest pain (angina)
Shortness of breath
Fast or irregular heartbeat
Heart palpitations
Priapism (a painful, four-hour erection)
Symptoms of a
severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
like hives, rash, itching, swelling and difficulty swallowing

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Taking a new medicine may make you wonder how your body will respond to it. Alpha-blocker medications are common prescriptions for a wide range of conditions. While alpha-blocker use is common, there are some cases where they aren’t the best choice. If your healthcare provider recommends taking an alpha-blocker, talk to them about your concerns. They can help you understand how best to take these medications.
