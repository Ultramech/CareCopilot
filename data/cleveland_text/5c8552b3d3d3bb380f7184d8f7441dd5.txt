Why is bowel prep important?
Bowel prep
cleans out your colon. This helps your
gastroenterologist
see the lining of your colon. A clean colon lets your doctor identify
polyps
that may lead to cancer. For your doctor, a clean colon is like driving on a clear, sunny day. A dirty colon is like driving in a rainstorm.
How do I use CLENPIQ?
CLENPIQ bowel prep typically comes in a ready-to-drink solution (a small bottle). You drink one bottle the day before your exam and a second bottle on the day of your exam. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.
If you’re a Cleveland Clinic patient, you must follow the instructions for bowel preparation exactly as prescribed or your colonoscopy will be canceled.
Key preparation instructions
The following instructions are key to a successful colonoscopy:
Your bowel must be empty so that your doctor can clearly view your colon.
Follow the instructions you get from your gastroenterologist exactly as they are written.
Don’t eat any solid food the entire day before your colonoscopy. Drink only clear liquids. Continue drinking clear liquids until 3 hours before your colonoscopy.
Get your bowel preparation kit at least five days before your colonoscopy.
Transportation on the day of your colonoscopy
A responsible adult driver must be with you when you check in before your colonoscopy. They must stay in the waiting area until you’re discharged. You’re not allowed to leave alone after your colonoscopy. If you don’t have a driver with you to take you home, your exam will be canceled.

Additional Common Questions
What if I have constipation?
You may take extra laxatives in the days leading to your prep. This should help resolve your constipation before your bowel prep day.
What if I've had poor prep results in the past?
Contact your physician as you’ll likely need additional bowel prep instructions.
What if I have motility issues from a medical condition?
Certain medical conditions and medications can slow bowel emptying or lead to constipation. Conditions like Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis (MS) or using a wheelchair can slow down your digestion. Medications like narcotics, gabapentin and anticholinergic medications can also have an impact. Contact your physician and be sure to share your medical history and current medication use, as you’ll likely need extra time and additional laxatives to complete your bowel prep.
What if I can’t drink a large volume of liquid?
Start your prep two to three hours earlier to allow yourself more time to complete the entire prep.

What if I can't finish my bowel prep?
If you can’t finish your entire bowel prep, you’ll likely need to reschedule your colonoscopy due to poor prep quality.
Do I still have to complete the entire prep if I’ve had bariatric surgery?
Gastric bypass surgery involves your stomach and small bowel. It doesn’t change the length of your colon. You may need to drink smaller amounts, more slowly. You’ll need to complete the entire bowel prep, it may just take longer time to complete it.
What if I’m on dialysis?
Please consult your nephrologist prior to scheduling to get instructions that are specific to you. In general, dialysis patients take the
Golytely
bowel prep and have the procedure on the same day as their dialysis (colonoscopy in AM, dialysis in PM).
How do I know if something is a clear liquid?
If you can pour it in a glass and you can see through it, it’s considered "clear liquid."
Can I take Uber®, Lyft®, taxi or bus home?
An adult must be present with you at check-in for your colonoscopy and remain in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged. You can hire a driver to take you home only if this adult escort is with you at check-in, remains in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged, and takes the hired ride home with you.
Can I “sleep it off” here and drive myself home?
No, you must have an adult with you when you check in. Your responsible adult must remain in the endoscopy center during your procedure and then drive you home. You can’t drive a vehicle after your procedure for the rest of the day.
