Treatment Details
How does hypnosis work?
You might have an image in your mind of how hypnosis works from TV or a movie. In real life, there are no magicians waving watches in front of your eyes to put you under their spell. Instead, your hypnotherapist will guide you through a series of exercises and meditations that help you relax and focus your mind.
There are four stages of hypnosis:

Induction
Deepening
Suggestions
Emergence
It’s a common myth that you lose consciousness or go to sleep when you’re under hypnosis. Most people remember everything that happens during a session. In fact, hypnosis can be a very active process. You’ll be focusing on and thinking about making positive changes in your life, and you’ll always be in control of your mind and thoughts.
Induction
Induction means to begin. During induction, you’ll start relaxing. Your therapist will help you focus your attention and ignore distractions. There are a few ways they might encourage you to relax, including:
Focusing your thoughts on a specific image or thought in your mind
Slow, controlled breathing
Tensing your muscles as you breathe in, then relaxing them as you breathe out (progressive muscle relaxation)
Deepening
Deepening is just what it sounds like — increasing your relaxation and focus. Think about induction like walking into the shallow end of a pool. Deepening is safely submerging your whole body under the water. In fact, your therapist might encourage you to think of images like slowly walking down a staircase or sinking into a comfortable bed. These first two stages will help you become more open to suggestions.
Suggestions
Suggestions are the actual changes in your behavior or experience you want to make. Your hypnotherapist will use imagery and carefully chosen language. They’ll gently suggest that you change how you think, act or respond to something. It can be a specific suggestion, like helping you quit smoking, or a more general one, like feeling less
job stress
.
Emergence
Your therapist will help you come out of hypnosis. If entering hypnosis is like sinking into a pool, emergence is floating back up to the surface. Your therapist will ask you to focus on reverse images of your deepeners. They’ll have you picture climbing back up the stairs or gently removing the covers and getting out of the comfortable bed.
How long does a hypnosis session last?
Hypnosis sessions usually last around an hour. You’ll probably need several sessions before you start seeing or feeling changes in how you think about your health or conditions you have.

Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of hypnosis?
Hypnosis is a safe, low-risk way to help you manage symptoms or some conditions. It’s becoming a more accepted and recognized form of therapy.
Many of the benefits people experience are anecdotal. This means we haven’t been able to prove exactly how or why hypnosis helped in a scientific study. But that doesn’t mean it’s fake or doesn’t work. The changes can be very real. In other words, if you feel better, it’s a helpful treatment.
Experts are still studying hypnotherapy to better understand it and how it helps people.
What are the risks of hypnotherapy?
It’s rare, but you might experience some side effects after a hypnotherapy session, including:
Dizziness
Drowsiness or feeling
fatigue
Headaches
Increased anxiety
Trouble sleeping

Tell your hypnotherapist if you experience any side effects or negative feelings.
Is hypnotherapy dangerous?
Hypnotherapy is safe when you work with a trained, certified therapist. Hypnosis isn’t mind control or brainwashing. And your hypnotherapist isn’t tricking your body or brain into changing. Any changes in your health or habits will come from you choosing to make them.
There’s always a chance hypnosis doesn’t help you. Be honest with yourself and your therapist. Your therapist wants to help you accomplish your goals. They won’t be offended if you find that hypnosis isn’t working well for you.
Recovery and Outlook
How long will I need hypnotherapy?
There’s not a set amount of time you’ll need hypnotherapy. Your therapist will monitor your progress. You might need only a few sessions to start seeing results, but it may take longer. Your therapist will develop a treatment plan for future sessions with your input and feedback.
When To Call the Doctor
How do I choose a hypnotherapist?
First, look for a healthcare professional who’s properly trained, licensed and credentialed in a healthcare field such as medicine, dentistry, psychiatry, psychology, social work or nursing. They should have additional training in hypnosis and hypnotherapy techniques.
The most important part of hypnosis is trusting your therapist. Like any healthcare provider or counselor, you should feel comfortable with them.

Your hypnotherapist will get to know you before you start your first session. You shouldn’t have to do any special preparation, just be yourself and be honest about what you hope to accomplish.
Your regular healthcare provider may be able to suggest a hypnotherapist. The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis or the American Association of Professional Hypnotherapists have information available about how to find a hypnotherapist near you.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Complementary medicine like hypnosis works alongside traditional medical approaches. Talk to your regular
primary care provider
if you’re experiencing any new or different symptoms. You may need other treatments alongside hypnosis to help you make healthy changes or manage symptoms.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Hypnosis can be a great way to help you manage a wide range of symptoms and conditions. You might be surprised to find that you don’t have to stare at a twirling spiral or get put under a spell for it to work. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. You’ll actively work with your hypnotherapist to find ways to make healthy changes in your daily routine.
Like any type of therapy, hypnosis can take some time. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see immediate results. But at the same time, be honest about your progress. Some people find hypnosis benefits them a lot — others never quite click with it. There’s no right or wrong answer. If it works for you, it can be a great tool. If not, your healthcare provider can help you find other treatment options.
