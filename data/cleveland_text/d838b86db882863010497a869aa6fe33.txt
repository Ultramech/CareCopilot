Overview
What is MiraLAX® bowel preparation?
MiraLAX® works as a laxative to clean out your colon (large intestine) to prepare it for a colonoscopy. MiraLAX is a laxative that softens your stool and helps you have a bowel movement. You mix MiraLAX with Gatorade® or another noncarbonated, clear beverage.

Why is bowel prep important?
Bowel prep is key to a successful colonoscopy because it clears out your colon. It helps your gastroenterologist best identify polyps that can sometimes become cancer during your exam. For your doctor, a clean colon is like driving on a clear, sunny day. A dirty colon is like driving in a rainstorm.
If you’re a Cleveland Clinic patient, you must follow the instructions for bowel preparation exactly as prescribed or your colonoscopy will be canceled.
How do I use MiraLAX bowel prep?
Using this type of bowel preparation involves buying 64 ounces of Gatorade (most people use two 32-ounce bottles), Propel®, Crystal Light® or another non-carbonated, clear liquid sports drink. Don’t use drinks that are red, orange or purple. You’ll also need one 238-gram bottle of MiraLAX and four Dulcolax® tablets.
Key preparation instructions
The following instructions are key to a successful colonoscopy:
Your bowel must be empty so that your doctor can clearly view your colon. Follow the instructions you get from your gastroenterologist exactly as they are written.
Don’t eat any solid food the entire day before your colonoscopy. Drink only clear liquids.
Get the products for your bowel preparation at least five days before your colonoscopy.
Transportation on the day of your colonoscopy
A responsible driver must accompany you when you check for your colonoscopy. They must stay in the waiting area until you’re discharged. You’re not allowed to leave alone after your colonoscopy. If you don’t have a driver to take you home, your exam will be canceled.

Additional Common Questions
What if I have constipation?
You may take extra laxatives in the days leading to your prep. This should help resolve your constipation prior to entering the bowel prep day.
What if I've had poor preps results in past?
Contact your physician as you’ll likely need additional bowel prep instructions.
What if I have motility issues from a medical condition?
Certain medical conditions and medications can slow bowel emptying or lead to constipation. Conditions like
Parkinson’s
,
multiple sclerosis (MS)
or using a wheelchair can slow down your digestion. Medications like narcotics, gabapentin and anticholinergic medications can also have an impact. Contact your physician and be sure to share your medical history and current medication use, as you’ll likely need extra time and additional laxatives to complete your bowel prep.

What if I can’t drink a large volume of liquid?
Start your prep two to three hours earlier to allow yourself more time to complete the entire prep.
What if I can't finish my bowel prep?
If you can’t finish your entire bowel prep, you’ll likely need to reschedule your colonoscopy due to poor prep quality.
Do I still have to complete the entire prep if I’ve had bariatric surgery?
Gastric bypass surgery involves your stomach and small bowel. It doesn’t change the length of your colon. You may need to drink smaller amounts, more slowly. You’ll need to complete the entire bowel prep, it may just take longer time to complete it.
What if I’m on dialysis?
Please consult your nephrologist before scheduling to get instructions that are specific to you. In general, dialysis patients take the
Golytely
bowel prep and have the procedure on the same day of their dialysis (colonoscopy in AM, dialysis in PM).
How do I know if something is considered a clear liquid diet?
If you can pour it in a glass and you can see through it, it’s considered "clear liquid."
Can I take Uber®, Lyft®, taxi or bus home?
An adult must be present with you at check-in for your colonoscopy and remain in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged. You can hire a driver to take you home only if this adult escort is with you at check-in, remains in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged, and takes the hired ride home with you.
Can I “sleep it off” here and drive myself home?
No, you must have an adult with you when you check in. Your responsible adult must remain in the endoscopy center during your procedure and then drive you home. You can’t drive a vehicle after your procedure for the rest of the day.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Good bowel preparation is a critical part of your colonoscopy. Make sure to follow your gastroenterologist’s instructions. Having a clear colon makes it easier for them to detect polyps, inflammation and other abnormalities. Be sure to ask them any questions you have about mixing MiraLAX and Gatorade (or other sports drinks).
Care at Cleveland Clinic
A colonoscopy or other screening is an important test for colon cancer. The team at Cleveland Clinic can give you peace of mind and expert care when you need it.
