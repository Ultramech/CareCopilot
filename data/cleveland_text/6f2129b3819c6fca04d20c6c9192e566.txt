Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)
Leber’s congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disease that affects babies’ retinas. Some babies have blindness at birth. Others have very poor vision. Changes in genes that develop and form retinas cause Leber’s congenital amaurosis. Treatment for children with very poor vision includes eyeglasses or magnifying glasses.

What Is Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis?
Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare disease that affects the
retinas
in babies’ eyes. “Congenital” means it’s present at birth. Babies born with LCA have
low vision
that gets worse as they grow up. They often lose some or all of their sight. One in three babies with Leber’s congenital amaurosis is born with
blindness
.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of Leber’s congenital amaurosis
Some babies with LCA are born with blindness. Other babies with the condition develop symptoms when they’re about 6 months old. You may not notice any changes in your baby’s vision right away. For example, babies often rub their eyes when they’re tired. But your baby frequently rubbing or poking at their eyes may be an early symptom of LCA. Other symptoms include:
Misaligned eyes (
strabismus
)
Sensitivity to light (
photophobia
)
Shaking eyes (
nystagmus
)
Your child’s pupils don’t adjust to changes in light (slow or missing pupillary response)
LCA causes
Leber’s congenital amaurosis happens when your baby inherits certain
genetic variations
that affect how their retinas develop.
The genetic variations affect the process that creates images that your baby sees. Normally, light-detecting cells (
photoreceptors
) in your baby’s retinas turn light into electrical signals. Your baby’s brain turns the signals into images that they see. Leber’s congenital amaurosis affects that process so there’s less electrical activity (signals). The less electrical activity there is, the less sight your baby has.
Variations in almost 30 different genes can cause Leber’s congenital amaurosis. The variations affect the following genes:

CEP290
CRB1
GUCY2D
RPE65
LCA is usually an
autosomal recessive
condition. That means both biological parents have one or more of the changed genes that can cause Leber’s congenital amaurosis.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose LCA
An
eye care specialist
will diagnose Leber’s congenital amaurosis. They’ll perform an
eye exam
to look at your child’s eyes (including inside them). They’ll do an electroretinography (ERG) test to measure the electrical activity in your child’s retinas. They may do an
optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scan. This test uses reflected light to create images of the back of your baby’s eyes.
Your child’s eye care specialist may do tests to rule out other conditions that can affect your child’s eyes. You might see this referred to as a
differential diagnosis
. Some conditions they’ll check for include:
Color blindness
Drooping eyelids (ptosis)
Joubert syndrome
Retinitis pigmentosa
Zellweger syndrome
Management and Treatment
Leber’s congenital amaurosis treatment
There’s no cure for Leber’s congenital amaurosis. Your child’s eye specialist will recommend low vision aids if your child can see. Low vision aids include
eyeglasses,
magnifying glasses and reading prisms.
Your child may be a candidate for gene therapy if genetic tests show they have a changed version of the
RPE65
gene.
Gene therapy
replaces diseased or inactive genes with copies of healthy genes. In some cases, gene therapy introduces new genes into your body to treat a specific disease.
When should my child see their eye care specialist?
Visit an eye care specialist if light seems to hurt their eyes. Babies rub their eyes when they’re tired. But a baby with LCA may rub or poke at their eyes even when they aren’t tired. These are symptoms of Leber’s congenital amaurosis or another eye condition.
Leber’s congenital amaurosis is a progressive disease. That means it gets worse over time. Ask your child’s eye care specialist to explain what changes in your baby’s vision mean that the condition is getting worse.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has Leber’s congenital amaurosis?
Your child will need regular eye exams to track any changes in their eyes. An eye care specialist will tell you how often your child will need their eyes examined.
Your child may benefit from
early intervention services
. These services support children with issues like blindness and low vision. Check out support groups for parents and family members, too. LCA is a rare disease. You may not know many people with children who have blindness or low vision. It may help to connect with people who do.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It may be devastating to learn your baby has Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA). There’s no cure for most cases of LCA. But there are treatments for very poor vision. And there are services and programs that can help your child if they have blindness.

If your child has LCA, take some time to understand what the condition means for your baby now and as they grow older. Don’t hesitate to ask your baby’s eye care specialist to explain how this condition may affect your baby.
It’s not easy to learn that your baby will need lifelong support to navigate their world. Connecting with others whose children have LCA may help.
