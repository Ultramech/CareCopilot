Pure Autonomic Failure
Pure autonomic failure (PAF) is a rare condition that causes sudden low blood pressure upon standing, as well as other autonomic nervous system issues. PAF slowly gets worse over time. There’s no cure, but certain therapies can help manage your symptoms.

Overview
What is pure autonomic failure?
Pure autonomic failure (PAF) is a rare
neurodegenerative condition
that affects your
autonomic nervous system
. The most common feature of PAF is
orthostatic hypotension
— a significant drop in
blood pressure
when you stand up. But PAF often causes other issues as well.

Your autonomic nervous system controls the automatic (out of your control) functions of your body that you need to survive. This includes things like blood pressure,
heart rate
, digestion and breathing. With PAF, you might first notice that you feel dizzy when you get up from a chair. You may notice other symptoms over time, like loss of bladder control or blurry vision.
PAF tends to develop in adults in their 40s to 60s. Healthcare providers used to call this condition idiopathic orthostatic hypotension or Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of pure autonomic failure?
The most common symptom of pure autonomic failure is orthostatic hypotension. This can make you feel
dizzy
and/or cause
fainting
when you transition to a standing position.
PAF can affect several organ systems. Other symptoms of PAF may include:
Sweating less than usual (
anhidrosis
) or more than usual (
hyperhidrosis
).
Issues with your
pupils
widening and narrowing properly, which may cause
blurred vision
.
Difficulty emptying your bladder (
urinary retention
).
Loss of bladder control (
urinary incontinence
).
Constipation
or loss of bowel control (
fecal incontinence
).
Sexual dysfunction
, like
erectile dysfunction
or
anorgasmia
.
These symptoms may happen before or after developing orthostatic hypotension. About half of people with PAF also have mild
anemia
.

What causes pure autonomic failure?
An abnormal buildup of a protein called alpha-synuclein in autonomic
nerves
causes pure autonomic failure.
The affected nerve cells are in clusters (called autonomic ganglia) on either side of your
spinal cord
or near organs. Over time, the number of these nerve cells decreases, causing autonomic malfunctions. PAF doesn’t affect any other nerves, and your
brain
and spinal cord don’t experience damage. Researchers don’t know why the buildup of alpha-synuclein happens or fully understand the purpose of the protein.
Alpha-synuclein also builds up in your brain if you have
Parkinson’s disease
,
multiple system atrophy
or
Lewy body dementia
. Some — but not all — people who have pure autonomic failure eventually develop one of these conditions.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is pure autonomic failure diagnosed?
The diagnostic process for pure autonomic failure mainly involves ruling out other conditions that cause orthostatic hypotension.
To start, your healthcare provider will:
Ask about your symptoms and medical history.
Do a
physical exam
and a
neurological exam
.
They’ll then likely recommend some tests. These may include:
Tilt table test
: This test shows how your blood pressure responds to standing up after lying down.
QSART (quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test or sweat) test
: This test looks at the nerves that control your sweating. A QSART can help diagnose autonomic nervous system conditions,
peripheral neuropathies
and some types of pain disorders.
Imaging tests
:
Cardiac functional imaging
and
brain MRI scans
can help rule out other conditions.
Laboratory tests
: Having low levels of
norepinephrine
in your blood and pee while lying down with minimal to no increase on standing typically supports a PAF diagnosis.
Thermoregulatory sweat test
: This test measures how much you sweat in a room that has controlled temperature, humidity and airflow capabilities. Providers don’t use this test very often.
Going through this testing process may feel overwhelming. But know that having the right diagnosis is important to getting the best care.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for pure autonomic failure?
There’s no cure for pure autonomic failure, so treatment involves managing its symptoms. Your healthcare team will work with you to tailor a plan that’s unique to your needs and goals.
Managing orthostatic hypotension
Your healthcare provider may recommend several strategies for managing orthostatic hypotension.
Examples of non-medical strategies include:
Slowly transitioning from lying or sitting positions to standing.
Increasing your water intake. Providers may recommend drinking 3 liters of water a day.
Increasing your salt intake or using electrolyte-replacement beverages.
Elevating the head of your bed four to six inches so you’re lying on an incline.
Wearing waist- or thigh-high
compression garments
.
Certain prescription medications may also help with orthostatic hypotension.
Managing bowel issues
For constipation, your provider may recommend eating foods with plenty of
fiber
and taking
stool softeners
. If constipation persists, you may need to use
enemas
.
For a loss of bowel control, treatment options include:
Dietary changes.
Bowel training.
Medications like
loperamide
and
diphenoxylate
.
Surgery, like
sacral nerve stimulation
or
colostomy
.

Managing urinary issues
If you have urinary retention, your provider may recommend using a
Foley catheter
to empty your bladder. Certain medications, like
bethanechol
, can also help.
The following medications can help urinary incontinence (an overactive bladder):
Oxybutynin
.
Mirabegron
.
Tolterodine
.
If medication doesn’t help, using a catheter may be a better option.
Managing sexual dysfunction
Certain medications, like
sildenafil
or
tadalafil
, can help erectile dysfunction. But these medications may worsen orthostatic hypotension.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for someone with pure autonomic failure?
The prognosis (outlook) for people with pure autonomic failure varies. PAF is progressive, which means it gets worse over time. For many, this happens slowly over decades. But PAF affects each person differently.
In a study of 100 people with PAF, 34% of them developed Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy within four years of receiving their PAF diagnosis.
Your healthcare team will give you a better idea of what to expect based on your unique situation. They’ll work with you closely to develop a treatment plan and monitor your health over the years.
What is the life expectancy of someone with pure autonomic failure?
It’s difficult for researchers to give a number related to life expectancy for someone with PAF. This is because the condition is rare, and there aren’t many long-term studies on it.

One study reported the average survival rate to be 12.5 years after diagnosis. But keep in mind that the condition affects everyone differently. Talk to your healthcare team about what to expect based on your symptoms.
Prevention
Can I prevent pure autonomic failure?
Pure autonomic failure isn’t preventable. Researchers don’t know why the buildup of alpha-synuclein in autonomic nerves happens in PAF.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have pure autonomic failure, you’ll need to see your healthcare provider regularly to keep an eye on the progression of PAF and to see if your treatment is working.
If you develop signs of Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy, see your provider as soon as possible.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider about PAF?
If you have PAF, it may be helpful to ask your provider the following questions:
What treatments do you recommend?
What can I do at home to manage PAF?
How quickly will PAF progress?
What other signs and symptoms should I be looking out for?
What’s my risk of developing Parkinson’s, Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy?
How often should I have medical appointments?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Developing orthostatic hypotension can be unsettling. And other symptoms of pure autonomic failure (PAF) can make you feel out of control of your body. Know that there’s nothing you could have done to prevent PAF, as it seems to affect people randomly. Your healthcare team will be by your side to develop a symptom management plan that’s best for your needs and goals. Don’t hesitate to ask questions or voice your concerns.
