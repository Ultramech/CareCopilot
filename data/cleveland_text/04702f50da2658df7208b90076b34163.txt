Cyst on Penis
A cyst on your penis usually isn’t a cause for concern. But, in some cases it could indicate other health problems, like sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Most of the time, penile cysts are harmless. Still, if you develop a skin cyst on your penis head, shaft or base, you should have it checked by your healthcare provider. They can determine what caused the cyst on your penis and recommend treatment to ease your symptoms.
How common is it to develop a cyst on my penis?
While some types of penile bumps are quite common, actual cysts on the penis don’t develop often. Penile cysts are usually no cause for concern. Still, it’s never a bad idea to see your healthcare provider.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of cyst on penis?
It’s important to know the difference between cysts and bumps caused by
sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs).
In general, cysts are:
Similar to the color of your
skin
.
Similar to the texture of your skin.
Not painful (but may be tender).
Not likely to change drastically in size.
Hard or firm to the touch.

Cysts on penis: What are the different types and causes?
Causes and symptoms can vary depending on the type of cyst you have on your penis:
Epidermoid cysts
An epidermoid cyst on your penis is usually harmless. These cysts are filled with keratin — a protein found in skin, hair and nails. Epidermoid cysts form when skin cells move deeper into your skin instead of sloughing off. Symptoms may include:

A small white or yellow bump.
A small blackhead in the center of the bump.
Redness or
inflammation
.
Drainage.
Epidermoid cysts are more likely to develop on your scrotum, but they can appear on your penis as well.
Sebaceous cysts
These cysts occur when your sebaceous glands (oil-producing glands) become damaged or blocked.
Sebaceous cysts
usually aren’t painful, but if they become inflamed, they may be tender. Symptoms may include:
A small lump under your skin.
Drainage.
Penile epidermal inclusion cysts
Epidermal inclusion cysts
are common overall, but they rarely appear on the penis. When they do occur, they’re generally a complication of circumcision. Symptoms may include:
A movable lump just underneath the skin.
A lump that slowly grows larger.
Median raphe cysts
These rare cysts are congenital (present at birth). They develop when tissue becomes trapped near the median raphe nerve in your penis.
Median raphe cysts usually don’t cause problems, but some people may develop symptoms later on in life, including:
Swelling in the area.
Painful urination
(pain when you pee).
Changes in urinary frequency (how often you pee).
Is a cyst on my penis contagious?
A true cyst isn’t contagious and can’t spread. However, if you have STD-related bumps, they can spread through sexual contact.
If you have an STD-related bump, it’s important to tell your sexual partners so they can have testing.
Do cysts hurt to touch?
Most of the time, a cyst on your penis doesn’t cause pain. However, if the bump becomes inflamed or irritated, it can be tender to the touch.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a cyst on penis diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination. If they suspect an STD, they’ll likely request
urinalyses
, blood tests or cultures to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, they may recommend a
biopsy
to rule out other conditions like
penile cancer
.
Management and Treatment
How do you get rid of a cyst on your pubic area?
In most cases, a cyst on your penis will go away on its own. However, if the cyst continues to be problematic, your healthcare provider may recommend treatment. Options could include:
Antibiotics
, for infection.
Steroid injections
, for inflammation.
Excision
, which includes surgical removal of the entire cyst, including the cyst wall and contents.
Drainage
, which can alleviate any pressure buildup.
Can you squeeze out a cyst?
Though it may be tempting, you should never squeeze a cyst or attempt to pop it. This can actually send bacteria deeper into your skin, resulting in the formation of more cysts.
