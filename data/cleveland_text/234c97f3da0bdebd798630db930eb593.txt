Overview
What is physical therapy (physiotherapy)?
Physical therapy, or physiotherapy, is treatment that helps you improve how your body performs physical movements. It can be part of a generalized
pain management
plan or a specific treatment for an injury or health condition. It’s common to need physical therapy after many types of surgery, too. You might also need physical therapy to help prevent injuries before they happen.

— a healthcare provider who’ll make sure you’re safe during your therapy.
How long you’ll need physical therapy depends on which injuries or health conditions you have and which area of your body needs help moving better. Some people only need a few weeks of physiotherapy to help with a short-term issue. Others need it for months or years to manage symptoms of a chronic (long-term) condition.

Stretching.
Strength training (with or without weights or exercise equipment).
Massage.
Heat or cold therapy.
Hydrotherapy
.

Physical therapy is usually an outpatient treatment, which means you aren’t staying in a hospital or healthcare facility while you do it. You might start therapy if you’re staying in the hospital after an injury or surgery then continue it after you go home.
Depending on where you live and which type of physical therapy you need, you might do your therapy at a specialized clinic, in the hospital or even in your own home. You might be able to do physical therapy with a virtual visit, either on a video call or over the phone (telehealth).

Musculoskeletal system

What are the risks of physical therapy?
Physiotherapy is very safe and effective. Like with any physical activity, you’ll have a small injury risk — including aggravating an existing injury. Talk to your physical therapist about how to do all your exercises and movements safely — especially if you’re planning on doing physical therapy at home or without supervision between appointments.
Recovery and Outlook
Is physical therapy worth it?
It might not be easy (especially at first), but physical therapy is definitely worth it. You might feel stressed, tired or exhausted after a physical therapy session. These feelings are valid and normal. Your physical therapist will help you set realistic goals and expectations.
Your strength, flexibility and mobility will improve over time. You might feel like physiotherapy isn’t working right away. But stick with it.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Visit a healthcare provider if you notice new or worsening symptoms. Tell your physical therapist if any part of your physical therapy seems too hard or too easy. They can adjust your treatment plan as you make progress.
Additional Common Questions
What is physical therapy vs. occupational therapy?
Physical therapy and occupational therapy both help you move your body better or more safely. The difference between them is their end goal.
People usually need physical therapy to manage symptoms of a health condition like pain and stiffness in a specific body part. It’s also common to need physical therapy while you’re rehabbing after an injury or surgery.
Occupational therapy
is more focused on helping people improve their ability to do common daily tasks and live as independently as possible. The occupation in occupational therapy doesn’t necessarily mean your ability to do your job or get back to work after an injury. Occupational therapy is a general term providers use to mean any of the daily tasks you do. An
occupational therapist
will help you improve your ability to do tasks like use a computer, shop for groceries or get dressed.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Physical therapy (physiotherapy) is a common treatment for lots of injuries and health conditions. It’s also a common rehab step after surgeries. Whether you only need a few sessions after an injury or long-term help managing a chronic condition, physical therapy can improve your strength, flexibility and mobility.
Don’t forget to give yourself credit while you’re in physical therapy. It’s hard (sometimes sweaty) work to manage symptoms like pain, stiffness or instability. But it’s worth it. Don’t be afraid to ask your therapist questions before, during and after sessions. They’ll help you understand everything about physical therapy and how it can benefit you.
