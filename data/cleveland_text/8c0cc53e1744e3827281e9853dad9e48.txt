Stem Cell Transplant (Bone Marrow Transplant)
A stem cell transplant can treat — and sometimes cure — certain blood disorders, cancers and autoimmune diseases. The procedure replaces unhealthy stem cells with healthy ones. Your provider might get healthy stem cells from your own bone marrow. Or they might use donated stem cells from another person.

Overview
In autologous stem cell transplants, healthy blood stem cells are collected and stored for infusion later.
What is a stem cell transplant?
Stem cells create blood in your bone marrow. Sometimes, healthcare providers collect them so they can give them back to you after chemotherapy (autologous stem cell transplant). In other instances, providers collect them from a donor and give them to someone who has cancerous, abnormal or damaged stem cells (allogeneic stem cell transplant). Autologous stem cell transplants are used to treat certain kinds of
cancer
, blood disorders and
autoimmune diseases
.

Most transplants use peripheral blood stem cells (immature stem cells in your bloodstream). But some use
bone marrow
or umbilical cord blood stem cells. If you receive a stem cell transplant, your provider may use your own healthy stem cells or donated stem cells.
Over
22,000
people living in the United States have a disease that a stem cell transplant could
cure
. People usually have stem cell transplant procedures when other treatments aren’t effective or if their condition comes back after treatment.
Other names for this procedure include:
Bone marrow transplant
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant
Types of stem cell (bone marrow) transplants
There are two types:
Allogeneic stem cell transplant
: Uses donated stem cells
Autologous stem cell transplant
: Uses your own healthy stem cells
Autologous stem cell transplants are slightly more common than allogeneic stem cell transplants.
Treatment Details
How does a stem cell (bone marrow) transplant work?
Whether you’re receiving donated stem cells or your own stem cells, the process feels a lot like receiving medication through a
central venous catheter
.
First, your provider may give you
fluids
and medication to help prevent side effects or reduce the chance your body may reject the new stem cells. Then, they’ll start infusing stem cells.
The process may take several hours. While you’re receiving new stem cells, your provider will frequently check for signs of fever, chills and other potential side effects.

A stem cell transplant itself isn’t painful. But many people develop side effects like nausea, vomiting and discomfort during recovery. Medication can help manage these side effects.
How successful are stem cell (bone marrow) transplants?
It depends on several factors, including:
The type of condition you have
Whether you have early- or late-stage disease
Whether you’ve had previous cancer treatments
Your age
Your body’s healing capacity
Because everyone is unique, calculating overall
survival rates
and life expectancy can be difficult. To learn more about survival rates and what they mean for you, talk to your healthcare provider.
What are the potential benefits and risks of stem cell (bone marrow) transplants?
Stem cell transplants may help cure or slow certain
blood cancers
or
blood disorders
that didn’t respond to other kinds of treatment.
The greatest risk is that you’ll go through the procedure and your transplanted stem cells can’t slow or eliminate your illness. Cancer can come back (
recur
) after a stem cell transplant. But it’s less likely to happen over time.
Stem cell (bone marrow) transplant complications
Potential complications vary based on your overall health, age and previous treatment, including pre-transplant chemotherapy (conditioning). If you’re considering a stem cell transplant, your healthcare provider will outline potential complications so you can weigh those risks against potential benefits.
Allogeneic stem cell transplants are more likely to cause:
Bacterial infection
Fungal infection
Graft vs. host disease (GvHD)
Viral infections

Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better?
It depends on the type of stem cell transplant you have. People who have autologous stem cell transplants usually recover in about two months.
It can take several months to up to a year to fully recover from an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Your healthcare provider may recommend you stay in or near the hospital or treatment center for the first 100 days after your procedure.
Is there anything I can do to make this treatment easier on me?
A successful stem cell transplant can cure your condition or slow its growth. But it’s not an overnight transformation. It can take a year or more for you to recover. Here are some things that can help in the meantime:
Baby your skin
. Your
skin
may be more sensitive after your transplant. Use mild soap and shampoo when you bathe or shower, remember to moisturize and protect your skin from sunlight.
Eat nutritious meals
. Focus on lean protein, a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy. Avoid undercooked meat and fish, unwashed fruits and vegetables, and non-processed dairy.
Protect yourself from infections
.
Wash your hands
, stay away from people who are sick and ask your healthcare provider what
vaccines
you should have.
Take care of your teeth
. Visit your
dentist
every six months and practice good
oral hygiene
.
Take it easy
. You may have days when you feel exhausted and days when you feel fine. A hard day doesn’t mean you’re not doing well. It means you need to give yourself a break.
Support your mental health
. You may find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster. Talking to a therapist or joining a support group can help. Ask your provider for recommendations.

When should I call my healthcare provider?
Tell your provider if you develop any of these symptoms while recovering from your stem cell transplant:
Chills
Coughing
, sneezing or
runny nose
Fever
over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius)
Frequent or
painful urination
Lightheadedness/
dizziness
Rash
Shortness of breath
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you’ve been coping with cancer or a blood disease, a stem cell transplant can be a new lease on life. It can mean hope for a cure or
remission
when other treatments haven’t worked. But stem cell transplants come with demanding physical challenges and significant risks. Not everyone who has cancer or blood disorders is a candidate for a stem cell transplant. And unfortunately, not everyone who needs a donor finds one. If you’re considering a stem cell transplant, talk to your healthcare provider about potential risks and benefits. They’ll evaluate your situation, options and potential outcomes.
