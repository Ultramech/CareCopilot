One symptom specific to atypical depression is a temporary mood improvement in response to actual or potential positive events. This is known as mood reactivity. Other key symptoms include increased appetite and rejection sensitivity.
“Atypical” doesn’t mean that the condition is odd or unusual. It’s just different from “typical” depression.
What is the difference between typical and atypical depression?
Typical and atypical depression are both mental health conditions that involve prolonged feelings of sadness and hopelessness. The main difference is that in atypical depression, your mood can temporarily brighten as a result of positive events (such as a fun birthday party). In typical major depression, your depressed mood is usually constant.
Typical depression often causes a
loss of appetite
and
insomnia
(difficulty falling and/or staying asleep), whereas atypical depression usually causes an increase in appetite and feeling sleepy despite sleeping enough or too much.
In addition, atypical depression tends to begin at an earlier age and last longer (often becoming a chronic condition) than typical depression.
Who gets atypical depression?
Atypical depression is twice as likely to affect
women
than men. It tends to begin in the teen years or early 20s.
How common is atypical depression?
Despite its name, atypical depression is quite common. It affects 15% to 36% of people with a depressive disorder. Approximately 121 million people worldwide have a depressive disorder.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of atypical depression?
The main sign of atypical depression (in comparison to typical depression) is that your mood temporarily improves in response to positive events. This usually doesn’t happen in typical depression.
In addition, people with atypical depression have at least two of the following symptoms:
Increase in appetite and/or significant weight gain.
Excessive sleepiness (
hypersomnia
).
Heavy feeling in their arms or legs (also called leaden paralysis).
Increased sensitivity to criticism or rejection, which results in significant social and occupational impairment. The emotional reactions may happen after imagined, anticipated or real rejection.
Other depressive symptoms that apply to atypical depression include:
Feeling very sad or hopeless.
Not enjoying things that used to bring you joy.
Being easily irritated or frustrated.
Having a difficult time concentrating or remembering things.
What causes atypical depression?
Researchers don’t know exactly why some people experience depression or atypical depression. But they believe the following factors contribute to its development:
Impaired functioning of
neurotransmitters
(chemicals that carry brain signals to other parts of your body) and/or neuroreceptors (the “receivers” of the signals).
Genetics. Having a biological family member with mood disorders, including
bipolar disorder
and
persistent depressive disorder
, may contribute to the development of atypical depression.
Trauma.
Chronic
stress
.
Additional risk factors for atypical depression include:
History of bipolar disorder and/or anxiety.
Negative childhood experiences (also called adverse childhood experiences).
Emotional, physical or sexual abuse.
Significant illness, such as a major injury or a
chronic illness
.
Grief following a significant loss.
History of
substance use
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is atypical depression diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose atypical depression based on a thorough understanding of your symptoms and medical and mental health history.
A provider will likely perform a physical exam and may order certain blood tests to rule out physical causes of depressive symptoms, such as
thyroid disease
.
The provider may refer you to a mental health specialist (
psychologist
or
psychiatrist
) for diagnosis and treatment.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for atypical depression?
Atypical depression often responds well to treatment. Your treatment may vary depending on the condition’s severity. Treatments for atypical depression usually include
psychotherapy
(talk therapy) and/or
medication
.
Lifestyle changes, such as exercising regularly or quitting alcohol or recreational drug use, can also help improve symptoms.
Psychotherapy
“Psychotherapy” is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change unhealthy emotions, thoughts and behaviors.

Psychotherapy takes place with a trained, licensed mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. It can provide support, education and guidance to help you function better and increase your well-being.
Mental health professionals often use
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
, one type of psychotherapy, to help treat atypical depression. During CBT, your therapist or psychologist helps you take a close look at your thoughts and emotions. You’ll come to understand how your thoughts affect your actions. Through CBT, you can unlearn negative thoughts and behaviors and learn to adopt healthier thinking patterns and habits.
Antidepressant medications
Various medications are available to treat depression (antidepressants), including atypical depression. There’s no single best antidepressant, and the best one for you depends on your symptoms and individual needs.
Usually, antidepressants help balance your levels of neurotransmitters, including
serotonin
,
dopamine
and
norepinephrine
.
Currently, there are six different classes of medications approved to treat depression, including:
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
.
Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
.
Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs)
.
Noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists.

Historically, people with atypical depression have responded best to MAOIs. However, this class of antidepressants has more severe side effects than other classes. There are also significant dietary restrictions. Because of this, healthcare providers don’t prescribe MAOIs as often.
Your provider will work with you to find the best medication for you.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for atypical depression?
The prognosis (outlook) for atypical depression depends if it’s properly treated.
Atypical depression is a serious medical condition with potential complications if it isn’t treated, including:

Prevention
How can I prevent atypical depression?
