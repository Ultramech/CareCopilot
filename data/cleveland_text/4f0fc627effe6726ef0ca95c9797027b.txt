Lifespan
The maximum human lifespan — so far — is a little over 120 years. That’s much greater than the average human life expectancy. But both of those metrics are trending upward. And the goal of modern medicine is to increase both the average and the maximum, while also narrowing the gap between the two.

What is lifespan?
Lifespan is the maximum length of time that a person can live. Right now, the maximum human lifespan is 122 years. Experts base that lifespan on the longest-lived person with a verifiable date of birth.

The person who holds that record is Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died in 1997. For
males
only, lifespan is a bit shorter. The verified longest-lived man was Jiroemon Kimura of Japan, who died in 2013 at age 116.
But lifespan is just one metric for how long humans can or should live. Others include:
Life expectancy
Longevity
Healthspan
Life expectancy
Life expectancy is an average age that a group of people are likely to survive to. It’s common for people to use this term interchangeably with “lifespan.”
There’s no way to predict how long a single person is going to live with any accuracy. So, experts calculate an approximate average based on population statistics.
Where you live can heavily influence your life expectancy. Some other factors that play a role in that include (but aren’t limited to) the following:
Access to healthcare (including physical access, affordability, and availability of professionals and supplies)
Access to nutritious foods and clean water
Availability of sanitation services
Biological family history
Inherited or genetic factors
Medical history
Presence of public safety services like firefighting and law enforcement agencies
War or armed conflicts
And sometimes, global concerns affect life expectancy. The worldwide
COVID-19
pandemic that started in late 2019 caused global life expectancy to drop for two straight years, sinking to 71 in 2021.

Longevity
Longevity is the term for living longer than the average life expectancy. And around the world, the number of people living longer than average is going up. In 2000, the number of people over 75 was about 152 million. As of 2023, that number has almost doubled to 300.8 million.
Healthspan
Advances in modern medicine mean people are living longer. But living longer isn’t the same thing as being alive and healthy. That’s where the concept of healthspan comes in.
Healthspan is how long people can live without chronic conditions and age-related disabilities. It’s a concept that researchers may use when looking at groups of people, not individuals. A group with a longer average healthspan may have better health than other similar groups. Or it might mean that health interventions aimed at the group are working.
What’s the average human life expectancy?
As of 2022, the worldwide average life expectancy was 72 years. That’s well over double what the average life expectancy was in 1900. Back then, it was 32.
For males, the average life expectancy is about 70 years. For females, it’s about 75 years.
But 72 is just the global average. It can vary a lot from country to country. In 2022, the top five average life expectancies worldwide were in:
Macao
: 85 years
Liechtenstein
: 84 years
Japan
: 84 years
Hong Kong
: 84 years
French Polynesia
: 84 years
The United States ranks 64th on that list, with an average life expectancy of 77 years. The average life expectancy for males in the U.S. is 75. For females, it’s 80.
What’s the difference between life expectancy and lifespan?
Life expectancy is the average age that people live to. This average can vary depending on where you live, your personal background and more. Lifespan is the maximum age people can live to, so it’s much longer than the average.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Lifespan, life expectancy and longevity are all words you might use to refer to the length of a person’s life, but they aren’t always the same thing. You might not always need to use these terms as precisely as an expert or researcher, but it can still help to know their meanings. And while these concepts can’t predict how long you’ll live, they can help you better understand some of the context of your health. That knowledge can help you live a life that’s healthier, longer and, hopefully, happier.
