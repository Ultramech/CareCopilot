These symptoms can feel like having uninvited guests stop by your house. They interrupt you and stop you from doing what you planned on doing that day. Luckily, the guests don’t stay too long.
Research suggests it could be the result of
inflammation
(an
immune system
response) behind your eye.
You may hear your healthcare provider refer to Tolosa-Hunt syndrome as:
Ophthalmoplegia.
Recurrent ophthalmoplegia.
Ophthalmoplegia syndrome.
How common is Tolosa-Hunt syndrome?
Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is rare. Studies estimate it affects 1 person per million throughout the world.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome?
Symptoms of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome happen suddenly and include:
A
headache
, with pain near your upper face and eyes (periorbital headache). This pain can be sharp or dull.
Seeing two of something you look at (

ptosis
).
Low vision

What causes Tolosa-Hunt syndrome?

Inflamed or narrow
blood vessels
. These block or slow blood from flowing to certain parts of your brain.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is Tolosa-Hunt syndrome diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose Tolosa-Hunt syndrome after a
physical exam
to review your symptoms and take a complete medical history. Blood tests and radiology imaging tests can confirm a diagnosis and rule out possible conditions with similar symptoms. Imaging tests for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome include a:
Computed tomography (CT) scan
: A series of X-rays and a computer produce a 3D image of soft tissues and bones in your body.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
test
: A large magnet, radio waves and a computer take pictures of the inside of your body.
A healthcare provider specifically looks for certain characteristics, like inflammation behind your eye, from imaging tests to make this diagnosis.
When does a Tolosa-Hunt syndrome diagnosis occur?
Tolosa-Hunt syndrome can affect anyone at any age, but a diagnosis is most common around age 40.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat Tolosa-Hunt syndrome?
Short-term steroid medications, like
corticosteroids
, treat Tolosa-Hunt syndrome symptoms. This medication reduces inflammation. Inflammation behind your eyes is what causes your symptoms.
Are there side effects of the treatment?
Talk to your healthcare provider about the possible side effects of steroids before starting a medication. Possible side effects of corticosteroids include:
Swelling
in your legs.
Increased appetite.
Mood changes.
Bruising easily.
Blurry vision
.
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
After taking prescribed steroids, you may feel better in one to three days. Without treatment, your symptoms may go away on their own within 15 to 20 days. Even after your symptoms go away, they may come back unexpectedly.
