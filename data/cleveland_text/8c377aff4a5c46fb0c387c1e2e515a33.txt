Interferons
Interferons are a type of lab-made protein that can help your immune system fight certain infections and diseases. Interferon medications act in a similar way to the natural interferons your body makes. Healthcare providers sometimes use interferons to treat viral infections, certain cancers and other health conditions.

Overview
What are interferons?
Interferons are a type of signaling protein. Your body naturally produces interferons to help your
immune system
fight certain infections, cancers and
autoimmune diseases
. They got their name because they “interfere” with
viruses
and other
germs
and prevent them from multiplying.

They can also be made manually in a lab to use as treatments for various diseases. They act in a similar way to the natural interferons your body makes. Scientists created the first lab-made interferons in 1986 as a treatment for certain kinds of
cancer
. Since then, different types of interferons have been created to fight other illnesses and infections.
How do interferons work?
Interferons are the frontline defenders in your body. A variety of cells, including
white blood cells
, produce interferons in response to infection and other stimuli, like cancer cells. They initiate signaling cascades by stimulating the infected cells and those nearby to produce
cytokines
.
Manufactured interferons, for example, tell your cytokines to attack the offending cells, can stop cancer cells and viruses from growing and dividing, and also help healthy cells fight infections.
There are three main types of interferons:
Interferon-alpha (or alfa).
Interferon-beta.
Interferon-gamma.
Interferons are broadly classified into three main types (alpha, beta and gamma) based on their cellular source and inducing agents. More recently, interferon lambda has been discovered and is under investigation.
What conditions do interferons treat?
The different types of interferons treat different diseases and conditions.

Interferon-alpha
Interferon-alpha can be used to treat various conditions, including cancers and infections like:
Chronic
hepatitis B and C
.
Hairy cell leukemia
(blood cell cancer).
Kaposi sarcoma
(AIDS-related tumor).
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Renal cell carcinoma
(a type of kidney cancer).
Malignant
melanoma
.
Genital warts
.
Interferon-beta
Healthcare providers use interferon-beta to treat various kinds of
multiple sclerosis
(MS), an autoimmune inflammatory illness. The medication can reduce inflammation in your spinal cord and brain to prevent nerve damage.
Interferon-gamma
Providers use interferon-gamma to treat
chronic granulomatous disease
. This is a disease that affects your immune system. They also use it to treat severe malignant
osteopetrosis
, which is a disease that affects your bones.
Although interferon lambda is considered to have critical roles in viral infections, cancer and autoimmune diseases, it’s only been shown experimentally to be useful for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C viral infection. It isn’t currently approved or authorized by the FDA for any clinical use.
Treatment Details
What happens during this treatment?
Your healthcare provider will usually give you interferons as an injection into your
muscle
or under your
skin
. You may also receive it as an infusion into a vein in your arm. The treatment typically takes place in the hospital or another medical setting. Your provider may be able to teach you how to give the medication to yourself at home. They’ll teach you how to properly prepare and administer the medicine.
The types, amounts and dosages of the injections or infusions will depend on your condition. For example, for chronic hepatitis treatment, you may receive interferon-alpha subcutaneously (under your skin) three times a week for 24 weeks. For multiple sclerosis, your provider may give you interferon-beta into a muscle once a week and subcutaneously three times a week. For chronic granulomatous disease, your provider may give you interferon-gamma subcutaneously three times a week.

Risks / Benefits
What are the potential benefits of this treatment?
Interferons are lab-made versions of proteins your body naturally makes. These medications work by helping your immune system find and attack cancer cells and viruses. Interferons can prevent cancer cells and viruses from growing and spreading. They can also stop other cells from getting infected.
What are the risks or complications of this treatment?
Interferons can cause some adverse effects and complications.
Interferon-alpha
Interferon-alpha can cause flu-like symptoms for a few hours after you receive the medication. These symptoms can include:
Headache
.
Fever
.
Chills
.
Nausea
.
It can also cause skin rashes, fatigue, alopecia, autoimmune reactions, loss of appetite and erectile dysfunction.
Interferon-beta
Interferon-beta can also cause flu-like symptoms within eight hours of receiving the medication, which can last for 24 hours. Symptoms may include chills, fever, headaches,
back pain
and
muscle aches
.

Interferon-gamma
Interferon-gamma can cause a number of adverse side effects, including:
Fever.
Chills.
Headache.
Fatigue
.
Skin rash
.
Tenderness and redness/discoloration at the injection site.
Diarrhea
.
Nausea and vomiting.
Weight loss
.
Autoimmune reactions.
Complications
In addition to these adverse side effects, interferons can cause some significant health complications, including:
Heart issues:
Using interferons as a treatment can cause some people to experience
low blood pressure
or develop an irregular or fast heartbeat. Your healthcare provider will want to track your health closely if you have any known heart conditions.
Mental health disorders:
Treatment with interferons has caused some people to develop
depression
or suicidal ideation. If you have a mental health condition, your provider will want to monitor you closely while taking an interferon.
Eye disease:
If you have an eye disease like
diabetes-related retinopathy
(a diabetes complication that affects your eyes), the use of interferons could make it worse. Your provider will recommend that you get your vision checked before you start taking interferons. You’ll need to have regular eye exams while you’re using them.
Thyroid disease:
Some people taking interferons have experienced thyroid issues like overactive thyroid (
hyperthyroidism
) or underactive thyroid (
hypothyroidism
). Your provider will check your thyroid levels before you start treatment with interferons.
Lung issues:
If you have lung diseases like
bronchitis
(an infection that causes inflammation of the major airways into your lungs) or
pneumonia
(a lung infection), the use of interferons can make them worse. Your provider will watch you closely while you’re taking the medication.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Interferons are a family of proteins that your body naturally produces. They’re made and released by your immune system to fight infection and disease. Healthcare providers use human-made versions of interferons to treat a wide range of health conditions, from viral infections to certain types of cancer. While they come with some risks, they also provide the benefit of treating and even curing certain diseases. If your healthcare provider wants to treat you with interferons, they’ve weighed the risks against the benefits and have decided they’re the best option for you.
