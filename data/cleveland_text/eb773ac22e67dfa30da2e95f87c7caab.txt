Ganglioglioma
A ganglioglioma is a rare type of brain tumor that’s often slow-growing and benign. One of the first signs of a ganglioglioma is seizures because they frequently occur near your temporal lobes. While most gangliogliomas are noncancerous, treatment is necessary to remove the tumor.

Overview
What is a ganglioglioma?
A ganglioglioma is a rare type of
brain tumor
made up of a mixture of neuronal cells and glial cells. Neuronal cells form
neurons
in your brain, which carry information throughout your body. Glial cells form the structure of your
central nervous system
and interact closely with neurons, helping them function correctly.

Gangliogliomas are also known as mixed neuronal-glial tumors. They most commonly affect children and young adults. Gangliogliomas are typically small, slow-growing and noncancerous (benign). They usually don’t spread to other parts of your body. Even though these tumors are benign, they can still cause problems and require treatment.
Most gangliogliomas are low-grade
gliomas
that aren’t cancerous and have a low risk of returning (recurrence). A glioma is a brain or spinal cord tumor that develops when glial cells grow out of control. Sometimes, gangliogliomas are classified as high-grade gangliogliomas, which means they can turn cancerous (malignant). These are aggressive and have a high risk of recurrence.
What are the types of gangliogliomas?
Gangliogliomas are found most often in your
temporal lobes
. But they may occur in any part of your
brain
, including your:
Cerebrum
.
Brainstem
.
Cerebellum
.
Thalamus
.
Hypothalamus
.
They may also occur in your
spinal cord
.
A desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma is a very rare type of ganglioglioma that occurs before the age of 2 in the upper part of a baby’s brain.
How common are gangliogliomas?
Each year, more than 4,000 children ages 19 and younger in the U.S. receive a brain or spinal cord tumor diagnosis. Gangliogliomas are very rare. They account for about 1% to 2% of all brain tumors in children and young adults.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of gangliogliomas?
Gangliogliomas most often occur near your temporal lobes, which are located near your ears. Because of their position in your brain, they tend to cause
epilepsy
. So,
seizures
may be your first clue that a ganglioglioma is present.
Other ganglioglioma symptoms usually develop slowly. Depending on the location of the tumor in your brain, symptoms may include:
Headaches
, especially upon waking in the morning.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Difficulty swallowing
.
Double vision
.
Unsteady gait (walk).
Fatigue
.
Dizziness
.
Weakness on one side of your body.
What causes gangliogliomas?
Most gangliogliomas develop randomly with no known cause. Researchers have discovered a
genetic mutation
in the
BRAF
gene that occurs in 10% to 60% of all gangliogliomas, but the mutation happens in a range of other tumors as well.
What are the risk factors for this condition?
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of children developing glial tumors, including gangliogliomas. These conditions include:
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)
.
Tuberous sclerosis
.
Turcot syndrome
.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
.
von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
.
In addition, brain and spinal cord tumors occur more frequently in
male
children than in female children. These tumors occur in white children more than any other racial/ethnic group.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are gangliogliomas diagnosed?
Your child’s healthcare provider will perform a
physical exam
and ask you about your child’s symptoms. They’ll go over your child’s medical history and perform a
neurological exam
as well. The neuro exam tests your child’s reflexes, muscle strength, mouth and eye movement, and alertness and coordination. Your child’s provider will likely order additional tests to make a diagnosis. These tests may include:
Computed tomography (CT) scan
:
This test uses a series of X-rays and a computer to produce images of your child’s brain.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
:
This test uses magnets, radio waves and a computer to produce images of your child’s brain.
Electroencephalogram (EEG)
:
This test measures and records your child’s brain’s electrical signals and activity.
Biopsy
:
Depending on your child’s situation, their provider may refer to a neurosurgeon to perform a biopsy to obtain samples of tissue that a
pathologist
will examine under a microscope and send for additional testing (such as genomic testing).
Management and Treatment
How do you treat ganglioglioma?
To make sure your child receives the best possible treatment, they should receive care at a pediatric medical center. They should see a board-certified pediatric
oncologist
or neuro-oncologist with extensive experience in treating gangliogliomas.

Your child’s ganglioglioma treatment will depend on several factors, including:
Your child’s overall health, age and medical history.
The type, location and size of the tumor.
Severity of the tumor.
Your child's tolerance for specific therapies, procedures or medications.
How your child’s providers expect the tumor to progress.
The first line of treatment is usually surgery to remove the
tumor
. Your child’s provider will remove as much of the tumor as possible. Surgery is sometimes limited due to the placement of the tumor in your child’s brain. If your child’s provider can’t remove the entire tumor and it’s high-grade, they may proceed with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy
is a procedure that uses high-energy X-rays and other types of radiation to destroy cancer cells and/or stop them from growing and dividing. Radiation therapy can precisely target the tumor. Your child’s provider may recommend radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent ganglioglioma.
Your child’s healthcare provider may also choose to use
chemotherapy
, a drug treatment that kills or shrinks cancer cells. They may also use
targeted therapy
, a drug treatment that attacks a specific marker in the tumor. Many gangliogliomas have specific markers that targeted therapy can destroy, such as
BRAF
mutations.

Providers may recommend clinical trials for children with recurrent tumors that aren’t responsive to other therapies.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the ganglioglioma prognosis?
The overall five-year
survival rate
for a ganglioglioma is more than 90%. That means the likelihood of your child being alive five years after they’ve received their diagnosis is very good. Survival depends on many factors, including the tumor grade, your child’s age and the location of the tumor.
What is the likelihood of relapse?
More than 95% of gangliogliomas are considered low-grade and won’t return after a complete tumor removal. Higher-grade gliomas like grade 3 gangliogliomas are more likely to recur (return) after surgery.
Prevention
Can gangliogliomas be prevented?
Researchers don’t know why gangliogliomas occur in some children and not others. There’s no way to prevent the condition.
Living With
When should my child see their healthcare provider?
If your child experiences a seizure or any other ganglioglioma symptoms, they should see their healthcare provider for an evaluation. Ganglioglioma symptoms may look like the symptoms of other health conditions, so it’s important to see your child’s provider for a proper diagnosis.
What questions should I ask my child’s healthcare provider?
If your child has a ganglioglioma, you probably have many questions. Some questions you may want to ask your child’s provider include:
What type of ganglioglioma does my child have?
Is it cancerous?
How will the tumor affect my child’s brain and health?
What are the treatment options?
Can you recommend a support group for families with children with gangliogliomas?

A note from Cleveland Clinic
“Your child has a brain tumor.” If you’ve heard those words, it’s a moment frozen in time. In one shattering moment, your life has changed forever. But don’t give up hope. While hearing those words can be devastating and shocking, it’s important to remember that most gangliogliomas are benign, low-grade tumors. It’s scary to hear your child has a tumor, regardless. And they’ll still need treatment. But the chances that your child will be tumor-free soon are very good. Talk to your child’s provider about their prognosis.
