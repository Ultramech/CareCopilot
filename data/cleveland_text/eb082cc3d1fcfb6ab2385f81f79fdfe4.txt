Migraine Hangover (Postdrome)
A migraine hangover (postdrome) is the last stage of a migraine. Symptoms include fatigue, mental fog and body aches. You’ll feel symptoms after a severe headache and right before you feel like yourself again. Not every migraine causes symptoms of a migraine hangover.

A
migraine
is a common condition that causes a severe, throbbing
headache
on one side of your head (a migraine attack). There are four phases to a migraine. A migraine hangover is the postdrome stage — the final stage before you feel better. Not everyone who experiences a migraine has symptoms in the postdrome stage.
Many people with migraine hangovers experience symptoms that can be as disruptive as the migraine itself. A healthcare provider can help you manage migraines and their aftereffects.
How common is a migraine hangover?
Studies show that more than 80% of people who experience migraine attack have migraine hangovers.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a migraine hangover?
Symptoms of a migraine hangover may include:
Fatigue
(feeling tired all the time).
Body aches like a
stiff neck
.
Difficulty concentrating.
Nausea
.
Light sensitivity.
Sound sensitivity.
Dizziness
.
Mood changes, ranging from euphoria (extreme happiness) to
depression
.
What does a migraine hangover feel like?
A migraine hangover feels similar to a traditional
hangover
, or the morning after a night of drinking a lot of alcohol. You’ll likely be tired and sore throughout your body. The room might feel like it’s spinning, which can make you feel nauseated. You may feel better resting in a dark and quiet area. It can be a challenge to focus on a specific task or make a decision. Your mood can also change, from feeling very happy to very sad.

The symptoms can temporarily prevent you from engaging in activities with your loved ones and being fully present in the moment.
How long can a migraine hangover last?
A migraine hangover can last for a few hours, up to two days. It starts right after migraine pain ends. Each person’s experience with this phase of a migraine is different, and the length of time can vary from one migraine to the next.
What causes a migraine hangover?
Healthcare providers aren’t exactly sure what causes migraine hangovers. Certain factors can trigger a migraine, which also triggers a migraine hangover, like
stress
, anxiety or missing a meal.
What are the risk factors for a migraine hangover?
If you have migraines, you’re at risk of migraine hangovers. Most people who have migraines also experience postdrome symptoms, but not everyone does.
What are the complications of a migraine hangover?
A migraine hangover is temporary, but how you feel can affect your ability to function. You might not want to participate in routine activities or feel well enough to get out of bed until your symptoms go away. You shouldn’t experience any lasting complications.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a migraine hangover diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose a migraine by learning more about your:
Medical history.
Biological family health history.
Symptoms and frequency of symptoms.
Your provider may use
blood tests
and imaging tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms before diagnosing migraines.
A migraine hangover happens after a migraine, so your provider may ask you to explain how you feel once your head pain stops and how long those symptoms last before you feel better.
Management and Treatment
How is a migraine hangover treated?
There isn’t a specific treatment available to help a migraine hangover go away. If you experience a migraine with a migraine hangover often, a healthcare provider may suggest medications to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.
There are some things you can do to help your body recover after a migraine that may reduce how long postdrome symptoms last like:
Get plenty of rest.
Stay hydrated and eat well-balanced meals.
Participate in light physical activities (like stretching).
Avoid triggers that make your symptoms worse, like bright lights and loud noises.
For some people,
caffeine
can ease migraine hangover symptoms. For others, it may make symptoms worse. You might find comfort in using a heating pad or an ice pack or meditating during this phase.
Ignoring your symptoms and pushing through strenuous activities can prevent your body from recovering from a migraine completely, which may bring on another attack.
It may help to keep a migraine journal or diary so you can find patterns or triggers that bring on migraines, how you felt and what you did to ease your symptoms. The solutions that might work to reduce your symptoms can vary from others who experience migraines.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a migraine hangover?
A migraine hangover is a sign that your migraine is almost over. Your symptoms can make you feel tired, sore or in a fog for up to 48 hours. These symptoms can go away sooner, and when they do, you’ll feel more like yourself. It’s tough to know when you might have a migraine hangover, but most people have one at some point if they regularly have migraines. A healthcare provider can help you manage migraines.
Prevention
Can a migraine hangover be prevented?
There’s no known way to prevent a migraine hangover, as experts don’t know what causes them. A healthcare provider may suggest preventive medications to reduce how often you have a migraine.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you experience a migraine, it can feel like the worst headache of your life. When the head pain goes away, you might not be in the clear just yet. A migraine hangover is the final stage of a migraine. But symptoms should go away within 48 hours and then, you’ll start to feel more like yourself again.
