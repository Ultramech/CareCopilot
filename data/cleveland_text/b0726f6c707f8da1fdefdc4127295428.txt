Management and Treatment
What is the best treatment for cervical spondylosis?
The best treatment is one that helps ease your symptoms. In general, healthcare providers start cervical spondylosis treatment with noninvasive, conservative treatments. For example, they may recommend:
Physical therapy.
Over-the-counter
pain relievers
.
Placing ice or applying heat to your neck for 15 minutes several times during the day.
Soft collar or brace.
If you have significant neck pain, your provider may recommend treatments like

or
radiofrequency ablation
.
If these treatments don’t help or your condition is a complication of cervical myelopathy or cervical radiculopathy, your provider may recommend
spinal fusion
surgery.
What are the treatment side effects?
Conservative treatments rarely cause side effects. Treatments like spinal fusion surgery, steroid injections or radiofrequency ablation have different side effects. Your healthcare provider will explain what you can expect, including any treatment side effects and complications.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Our bodies change as we age, and one of those changes may be cervical spondylosis. It can make your neck hurt, ache or feel stiff. Everyone’s susceptible, but people who spend hours looking up toward the ceiling or down toward the ground are more likely to develop it. Healthcare providers can’t cure cervical spondylosis, but they have treatments to make your neck less stiff or painful. Talk to a healthcare provider if your neck hurts or feels stiff for more than a few days.
