Buerger’s Disease
Buerger’s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a rare disease most often found in those who smoke. The blood vessels in their legs, arms, feet and hands get inflamed, making it hard for blood to travel through. Clots make the issue worse, leading to pain and damaged tissue. Quitting smoking is the best way to make symptoms better.

Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between Buerger’s disease and Raynaud’s disease?
Raynaud’s disease or syndrome can be a symptom of Buerger’s disease. With Raynaud’s disease, the blood vessels in your toes and fingers collapse because you’re feeling cold or you’re under stress. The lack of enough blood getting through your blood vessels makes your skin look white or blue. After a few minutes or hours, your skin looks red and can feel numb or tingly.
Simply warming up your hands, wearing gloves or wearing warm socks can help relieve the symptoms. Buerger’s disease is painful and has many more symptoms than Raynaud’s disease.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

While you can take medicines for your symptoms, the best treatment for Buerger’s disease is to quit smoking. Most people with Buerger’s disease get relief from their symptoms when they stop smoking. Ask your provider to help you quit smoking so you can feel better.
