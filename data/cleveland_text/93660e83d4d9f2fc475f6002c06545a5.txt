Craniotomy
A craniotomy is a type of brain surgery where a surgeon removes part of your skull to access your brain. During the same surgery, your surgeon will replace the removed part of your skull before closing the incision site. A craniotomy treats tumors, blood clots and epilepsy. It can take up to two months to heal after a craniotomy.

Overview
What is a craniotomy?
A craniotomy is a type of
brain surgery
where a
neurosurgeon
will open and remove a piece of your skull to access your
brain
. During the same surgery, your surgeon will reapply the piece of your skull. A craniotomy is a major surgery. A surgeon usually considers this type of treatment after diagnosing a
brain tumor
or life-threatening condition or after a
traumatic brain injury
.

What is the difference between a craniotomy and a craniectomy?
While both a craniotomy and a
craniectomy
are types of brain surgery, they’re different procedures. A craniotomy removes and replaces a piece of your skull to access your brain. A surgeon will also remove a piece of your skull during a craniectomy, but the removed piece of skull isn’t immediately put back into place after surgery. You may need a follow-up surgery called a
cranioplasty
to replace the missing part of your skull.
What are the types of craniotomy?
There are several types of craniotomy procedures. Their names relate to the location where your surgeon will remove a piece of your skull to access your brain. Types of craniotomy surgeries include:
Frontal: The front of your skull near your hairline.
Temporal: Part of your skull next to your eyes and in front of your ear.
Parietal: The top-middle and upper back of your skull.
Pterional (frontotemporal): The side of your skull, behind your temple.
Orbitozygomatic: Part of your skull near your eye socket and cheek.
Retrosigmoid (keyhole): A small incision in the area of your skull behind your ear.
Suboccipital: The base of your skull, above your neck.
What does craniotomy treat?
You may need a craniotomy to treat:
A
tumor
.
A
blood clot
.
An abnormal collection of blood vessels (
vascular malformations
).
Tangled blood vessels (
arteriovenous malformation
).
An artery enlargement (
aneurysm
).
Swelling or pressure in your brain.
Epilepsy
.
A
skull fracture

How should I prepare for a craniotomy?
Before craniotomy surgery, you’ll meet with your surgeon, who’ll carefully plan the procedure. They’ll order several tests to assess your health and the reason for your surgery. Tests also help your anesthesiologist determine how much anesthetic to give during your procedure. You may need the following tests before a craniotomy:
Physical examination
.
Blood tests.
Imaging tests (
MRI
,
CT scan
,
PET scan
or
angiography
).
Your surgeon will let you know how you can prepare for your surgery, which may include:
Arriving on the day of your surgery on an empty stomach.
Stopping any
blood-thinning
medications three to 10 days before your surgery.
Taking
antibiotics
,
anticonvulsant
medications or
corticosteroids
before the day of your surgery.
In addition, your surgeon will discuss the results of your tests with you and explain the procedure. They’ll also explain the side effects of the treatment, your healing time and what to expect after surgery. If you have any questions about the surgery, ask your surgeon before the day of your procedure.
What happens during a craniotomy?
On the day of your craniotomy surgery, an
anesthesiologist
will give you
anesthesia
. This will make it so you don’t feel any pain. In the operating room, your surgical team will adjust the position of your head and body to avoid putting pressure on any points.
Your surgeon will begin by shaving any hair near the incision site, and they’ll sterilize (use iodine or alcohol to kill any germs and reduce your risk of infection) your head. Then, they’ll make an incision or opening in your
skin
. The location of the opening varies according to the type of craniotomy you need. Your surgeon will adjust or move the
muscles
around your skull. Next, your surgeon will drill several holes and cut in between each hole with a medical saw to remove a piece of your skull. After removing the piece of your skull, your surgical team will place it on a surgical instrument table so they can use the same piece to close up your skull at the end of your surgery.
Next, your surgeon will remove or repair your brain according to the reason for your surgery.
Once your surgeon treats your brain condition, they’ll fit your skull back into place like a puzzle. Then, your surgeon will move any muscles or tissue back into place and close up the incision in your skin.
Are you awake during a craniotomy?
Some types of craniotomy procedures require you to be awake for the surgery. This happens if your surgeon needs to see how your brain functions, especially if they’re working on the part of your brain that controls your movement, speech or vision. During an “awake” craniotomy, you’ll receive a localized anesthetic so you won’t feel any pain, and it won’t make you fall asleep.

How long does a craniotomy procedure take?
Craniotomy procedures can take three to five hours, but they can last longer depending on what your surgeon needs to do.
What happens after a craniotomy?
After a craniotomy, you’ll move into the intensive care unit (ICU) in a hospital. Here, your care team will monitor your healing until you’re able to move out of the ICU. You’ll need to stay in the hospital for up to a week after your surgery.
You’ll need to stay in bed with your head elevated as you recover. Your care team will keep track of your
vitals
and give you medications as needed to provide comfort and prevent complications.
When you’re ready to leave the hospital, you’ll receive instructions so you can finish recovery at home. The main focus of your recovery is rest.
