Axillary Temperature
Axillary temperature is a body temperature you take in your child’s armpit. You place the tip of a digital thermometer in your child’s armpit and hold their arm against their side until the thermometer beeps. Underarm temp isn’t as accurate as other methods so add ½ to 1 degree Fahrenheit (.3 to .6 degrees Celsius) to it.

Overview
What is axillary temperature?
An axillary temperature (also called an underarm temperature or armpit temperature) is a number that can help you know if your child has a fever. You take your child’s axillary temp by placing the tip of a digital
thermometer
in their armpit. After a short wait, the thermometer beeps and the display screen shows their temperature (in Fahrenheit or Celsius).

Is axillary temperature accurate?
Sort of. An underarm temp isn’t as accurate as other numbers, like a rectal temperature or oral temperature. But this method is noninvasive and simple. And it lets you (or others, like daycare teachers) quickly check for a
fever
.
Do you add a degree for axillary temperature?
Yes. You should add ½ to 1 degree Fahrenheit (.3 to .6 degrees Celsius) to an axillary temp to get a more accurate sense of your child’s temperature. Be sure to tell your
pediatrician
if you do this.
Research
shows that an armpit temp runs lower than oral or
rectal temperatures
. This is because with an axillary temp, the tip of the thermometer is only against your child’s skin and not inside their body. So, the reading isn’t a true internal temperature.
Adding up to a full degree Fahrenheit to the armpit temp reading makes the number more accurate. But when possible, it’s a good idea to follow up an armpit check with a rectal, oral, forehead or ear measurement. Your pediatrician can help you understand which method is best based on your child’s age.
How do I take my child’s axillary temperature?
You can use a standard digital thermometer to measure axillary temperature. (Don’t use a glass thermometer.) Be sure to follow the instructions on the package for how to clean the thermometer before and after use. To take your child’s underarm temp, follow these steps:

Remove any clothing that’s covering your child’s arm so you can easily access their armpit. The thermometer tip must directly touch their skin.
Turn on the thermometer.
Lift your child’s arm.
Put the tip of the thermometer in the center of your child’s armpit. This is the pocket area that’s hidden if your child’s arm is at their side.
Lower your child’s arm back down, with the thermometer still in place.
Keep your child’s arm snug against their body. It may help to hold your child close to you so your arm can keep their arm in place. You shouldn’t be able to see the thermometer tip.
When the thermometer beeps, remove it and read the temperature on the display screen.
Write down the temperature.
Add ½ to 1 degree Fahrenheit (.3 to .6 degrees Celsius) to get an “adjusted” temperature.
Report both numbers to your pediatrician if you’re concerned about a fever.
What’s a normal axillary temperature for infants?
Infants typically have an underarm temp of around 98.24 degrees F (36.8 degrees C), according to a
study
published in 2023. It’s normal for your baby’s temperature to be a little higher or lower than this. But your baby
has a fever
if their underarm temp is 99 degrees F (37.22 degrees C) or higher. This fever threshold applies to infants as well as young children up to age 5.
After age 5, you should take your child’s temperature orally (in their mouth) whenever possible. An oral reading of 100 degrees F (37.77 degrees C) or higher is a fever.

Additional Common Questions
What’s the normal range for axillary temperature in adults?
The average axillary temp in adults ranges from 95 to 98.47 degrees F (35.01 to 36.93 degrees C), according to a
systematic review
published in 2019. But it’s a good idea to take your temperature orally, if possible, to get more accurate results.
When it comes to body temperature, what’s
normal
can vary from person to person. And it can also change throughout your life. Your healthcare provider can explain more about what’s normal for you.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s a familiar scene. Your child doesn’t feel well, and you’re making the morning judgment call of whether or not to send them to daycare. Out comes the thermometer. If you’re doing an armpit check, the number on the screen might give you a false sense of relief. Not a fever! But then you wonder — is an armpit temp accurate?
For a quick read, an underarm temp is better than nothing. But if you think your child has a fever, you should use a more accurate method — like oral, rectal, forehead or ear — as soon as you can. Call your pediatrician if you have questions about what your child’s temperature should be or how best to check for a fever.
