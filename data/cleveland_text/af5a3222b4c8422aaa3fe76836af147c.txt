Pes Anserine Bursitis
Your pes anserinus bursa is a thin, fluid-filled sac located on the inside of your knee joint. It cushions your joint and prevents your bones from rubbing against each other. Pes anserine bursitis occurs when inflammation affects this bursa, causing pain, swelling and tenderness. Fortunately, many nonsurgical treatment options are available.

What Is Pes Anserine Bursitis?
Pes anserine bursitis, or pes anserinus bursitis, occurs when the bursa next to your knee joint becomes inflamed.
Pes anserine bursitis, or pes anserinus bursitis (pronounced “ber-CY-tuss”), occurs when the bursa next to your
knee joint
becomes irritated and produces too much fluid. The bursa then swells, causing
knee pain
and tenderness.

A bursa is a fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion and lubricant. Bursae (plural form of bursa) allow your
tendons
and
muscles
to glide smoothly along your
bones
.
Your pes anserinus bursa is located between three conjoined tendons (your sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus) and your shin bone (
tibia
). The term “pes anserinus” means “goose’s foot” in Latin. As the conjoined tendons attach to your tibia, it looks like a goose’s footprint.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of pes anserine bursitis
People with pes anserine bursitis usually develop one or more warning signs. Pes anserine symptoms may include:
Pain below your knee joint that develops gradually and feels better with rest
Knee pain that worsens during physical activity or climbing stairs
Pain on the inside of your knee
, 2 to 3 inches below your knee joint
Your pain level can vary depending on how advanced your condition is. In general, people with pes anserine bursitis experience more discomfort when kneeling, standing up from a chair or walking up and down stairs. Typically, pain improves with enough rest.
Pes anserine bursitis causes
Bursitis
most often occurs due to overuse or stress on your bursae. Some of the most common pes anserine bursitis causes include:
Playing sports that require repetitive knee movements, like soccer or tennis
Tight
hamstrings
Abnormal knee alignment (valgus)
Overuse of your knee
Improper training techniques, like not properly stretching before a workout

females

Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose pes anserine bursitis
Your healthcare provider will examine your knee and discuss your symptoms with you. Because pes anserine bursitis can have the same symptoms as a stress fracture, you may need a
knee X-ray
to rule out a
broken bone
.
Ultrasound
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
may also be necessary to determine the extent of your injury.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat pes anserine bursitis?
There are several ways to reduce discomfort and begin your road to recovery. Pes anserine bursitis treatment includes:
Medication
.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
can help reduce pain and swelling.
Rest
.
Take a break from activities that lead to bursitis flare-ups. Ask your healthcare provider when you can return to your normal routines.
Cold packs
.
Applying ice to the affected area three to four times daily can help reduce inflammation.
Orthotics
.
If your pain is due to abnormal knee alignment, wedge insoles can help you keep your leg in the right position.
Kinesiology tape
.
You can use kinesiology tape to ease your pain symptoms. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about proper techniques.
Physical therapy
.
Your healthcare provider may recommend ultrasound treatments or stretching exercises to help you regain strength and range of motion.
Bursa injections
. In rare cases, your provider may inject steroid medications into your bursa to relieve your symptoms.
Platelet-rich plasma
(PRP) injections
. Your provider takes PRP from a sample of your blood. They’ll use the PRP to promote healing and tissue regeneration.
Surgery
.
Though rare, you may need surgery in severe cases. During this procedure, your provider surgically removes your bursa.
When should I call my healthcare provider?

Outlook / Prognosis
How long does pes anserine bursitis last?
Most people with pes anserine bursitis heal in about six to eight weeks. It could take longer for more severe cases. You’re likely to recover faster if you rest and seek proper treatment.
You can usually return to work immediately following pes anserine bursitis treatment, especially if you have a desk job. But if your job is physically demanding, you may need to take a few weeks off. Ask your healthcare provider when it’s safe for you to return to work or school.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk for pes anserine bursitis?
To reduce your risk for pes anserine bursitis, ask your healthcare provider to recommend exercises you can do at home. These exercises can help stretch and strengthen the muscles in your knees, thighs and abdomen — and in many cases, they can prevent a recurrence.
