Celiac Plexus Block
A celiac plexus block relieves severe abdominal pain caused by pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis. It’s a type of nerve block that stops a bundle of nerves in your abdomen from sending pain signals to your brain. Some medications used during a celiac plexus block provide temporary pain relief, while others offer long-term relief.

Policy
Healthcare providers use celiac plexus blocks to treat conditions that can cause severe
abdominal pain
. You may need only one injection or several to manage pain.
What is the celiac plexus?
The celiac plexus is a group of nerves in your upper abdomen. It sits behind your pancreas and is close to your aorta (your largest
blood vessel
). It’s part of your
nervous system
.
Celiac plexus nerves send signals (communicate) to your brain and
spinal cord
from
digestive system
organs, including your:
Gallbladder
.
Intestines
.
Liver
.
Pancreas
.
Stomach
.
It can be painful when something presses against these nerves.
What does a celiac plexus block treat?
Healthcare providers use a celiac plexus block to ease chronic and severe abdominal pain caused by the following:
Pancreatic cancer
: Cancerous tumors can put pressure on your celiac plexus, causing pain.
Pancreatitis
: A celiac plexus block can alleviate severe
upper abdominal pain
or
back pain
caused by
inflammation
(swelling) of your pancreas.
Most people have significant abdominal pain at the time they receive a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Healthcare providers typically prescribe strong
pain medicines
to manage this pain. But these medications can cause uncomfortable side effects like
confusion
,
constipation
and
nausea
. Even with medicine, you may still have pain. A celiac plexus block might help in these situations.

Treatment Details
How should I prepare for a celiac plexus block?
Your healthcare provider will give you instructions to follow before a celiac plexus block. Your instructions may include:
Stop taking certain medicines like
blood thinners
a few days before the procedure. Don’t make changes to your medications unless your provider approves it.
Don’t eat or drink for several hours before the procedure. Anesthesia is safer on an empty stomach.
Quit smoking
, as tobacco products could increase the risk of complications.
Arrange for someone to drive you to and from your appointment. A celiac plexus block is an outpatient procedure. You can go home the same day.
What happens during a celiac plexus block?
During a celiac plexus block, your provider will:
Give you a
sedative
medication through a needle in a vein in your arm (intravenously). This will help you relax, but you won’t be asleep.
Instruct you to lie on your stomach on a table with a pillow underneath your hips. If this is uncomfortable, your provider may position you to lie with your back on the table.
Sterilize (clean) the treatment area with an antiseptic.
Numb the treatment area with a local
anesthetic
injection. You may feel a slight pinch and pressure.
Insert a needle and inject a contrast dye into your abdominal region. The contrast dye shows up on an imaging scan like an
X-ray
, a
CT scan
or an endoscopic ultrasound. This helps your provider put the medication in the right place.
Inject a pain medicine (anesthetic) or steroid into the treatment area.
Inject alcohol or phenol into the celiac plexus (for a neurolytic procedure).
How long does a celiac plexus block take?
The entire celiac plexus block procedure usually takes about an hour. The actual injection is only a few minutes. You’ll need to get prepped before the injection and wait under observation for at least 30 minutes afterward. Your procedure time may be longer depending on the technique your provider used.
What happens after a celiac plexus block?
After a celiac plexus block, you may start feeling pain relief within 30 minutes. Your provider will have you wait at the treatment center under observation for at least 30 minutes to monitor you for complications. Within an hour or so, you’ll be able to go home. You’ll need to have someone drive you home.

Recovery and Outlook
What does recovery look like after a celiac plexus block?
You should be able to go back to your regular activities within 24 to 48 hours after a celiac plexus block. You shouldn’t drive or do any strenuous exercise or lifting for the first 24 hours. You can also resume eating and drinking regularly after the procedure.
If you stop taking medications before treatment, your provider will let you know when it’s safe to start taking those again. It’s usually OK after the procedure.
How long does a celiac plexus block last?
The length of time you’ll feel pain relief after a celiac plexus block varies from person to person. Your provider will let you know what you can expect based on the type of medication they inject into your celiac plexus. For example, many providers inject a combination of an anesthetic and a steroid medication during a block. This may provide three to six months of pain relief. You may need another treatment in the future.
For longer-term relief, your provider may perform a neurolytic celiac plexus block. This technique destroys part of the nerves that send pain signals to your brain. You generally won’t need another treatment if you undergo a neurolytic block.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Pain can dampen your quality of life. You may not feel well enough to get out of bed or spend time with your loved ones. Taking pain medications may also prevent you from feeling your best due to side effects like dizziness and nausea. If pain keeps you from enjoying each day, contact your care team about trying new pain management options, like a celiac plexus block.
You might be nervous to undergo this procedure, especially if you’re not a fan of needles, but you won’t feel any pain as it happens. Your care team will be with you to answer any questions and let you know what you can expect from a celiac plexus block. Don’t hesitate to contact your provider if you notice any side effects after the injection.
