Symptoms of
M. pneumoniae
infection can be mild, like a cold, even when you have pneumonia. This is why it’s sometimes called “walking pneumonia.” Sometimes, it progresses to severe complications.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of a mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can be mild, like a cold, even when you have pneumonia.
Symptoms of
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections usually cause mild respiratory symptoms. But sometimes, symptoms can become severe. They include:
Fever
Headache
Fatigue
Chills
Cough
Sore throat
Shortness of breath
Runny or stuffy nose
Wheezing
Rash (uncommon)
Kids might also have digestive symptoms, like diarrhea or vomiting.
Causes
Bacteria cause
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections. They spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing. But you usually have to spend a lot of time around someone to get infected.
Outbreaks of
M. pneumoniae
can happen where people are living close together. Examples include:
Boarding schools
College dorms
Hospitals
Long-term care facilities
Military bases
Summer camps
Risk factors
Young adults and school-aged kids are most likely to get
M. pneumoniae
infections. You’re at a higher risk for serious illness if you:
Have a
weakened immune system
Have
asthma
,
COPD
(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or another chronic respiratory condition
Complications
Complications aren’t common but can be serious. They include:
Advertisement
Blood clotting issues, like
disseminated intravascular coagulation
Brain swelling (encephalitis)
Destruction of red blood cells (
hemolytic anemia
)
Guillain-Barré syndrome
Kidney issues
Painful ulcers (
Mycoplasma
-induced rash and mucositis/MIRM)
Severe lung infections
Stevens-Johnson syndrome
(SJS)
Worsening or development of asthma symptoms
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Healthcare providers don’t regularly test for
M. pneumoniae
infections. They can use a chest X-ray to look for pneumonia. Then, they can use a
nose and throat swab
to determine the cause of the infection — like the specific bacterium or virus.
Management and Treatment
How is
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
treated
?
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
usually goes away on its own. If you have pneumonia or other severe symptoms, a healthcare provider will treat you with antibiotics.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to your healthcare provider if you have a long-term health condition or compromised immune system and you have signs of an infection. Go to the emergency room if you have difficulty breathing or other severe symptoms.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infection?
If you have a mild infection, it should get better on its own within two to three weeks. If your symptoms get worse or if you have other health conditions, you’ll need antibiotics to get rid of the infection.
Prevention
Can
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections be prevented?
You can reduce your risk of getting and spreading infections by:
Washing your hands frequently
Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
Disinfecting frequently-touched surfaces (think toys, phones, doorknobs and countertops)
Avoiding others when you’re sick
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Even though the name sounds scary,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections usually aren’t serious. But like all respiratory infections, some cases can be serious. Don’t hesitate to see a healthcare provider if you have difficulty breathing or other serious symptoms.
