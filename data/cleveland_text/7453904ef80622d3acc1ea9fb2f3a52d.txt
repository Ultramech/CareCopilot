In addition to allergy testing, your allergist appointment may also include:
Lung function testing (spirometry, pulmonary function testing).
This is a test to measure your lung function. It helps in the diagnosis and management of asthma.
Instructions on how to use medical devices.
Your provider might prescribe and demonstrate the use of epinephrine injectors for severe allergic reactions or inhalers and nebulizers for asthma.
How do you become an allergist?
To become an allergist in the U.S., you must first complete medical school and a three-year residency in either internal medicine or pediatrics. This includes passing the exam for either the American Board of Internal Medicine or the American Board of Pediatrics.
