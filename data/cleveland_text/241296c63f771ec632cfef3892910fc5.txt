Iridodialysis
Iridodialysis is the name for what happens if your iris separates from the ciliary body of your eye. It usually happens because of an eye injury. Small tears may not need treatment, but larger ones may need surgery.

Overview
Iridodialysis is the name for what happens when your iris separates from the ciliary body of your eye.
What is iridodialysis?
Iridodialysis refers to the separation of the
iris
of your
eye
at the root of the iris. The root, the thinnest part, usually attaches to the ciliary body of your eye.

The ciliary body is a part of your inner eye. One of its functions is to make aqueous humor, a fluid that provides your eye with nutrients. The ciliary body also contains the ciliary muscle, which helps to shape your lens.
Iridodialysis typically happens because of blunt or penetrating damage from an
eye injury
. It may also happen during eye surgery, like
cataract surgery
. Iridodialysis can make it look like you have a second pupil in one eye.
You pronounce iridodialysis as “ear-id-oe-die-
AL
-is-is.” The plural form is iridodialyses (“ear-id-oe-die-
AL
-is-eez”).
Another name for iridodialysis is coredialysis, although some people may use the term coredialysis to refer to a surgical tear rather than a traumatic tear.
Who does iridodialysis affect?
Eye injuries — and, therefore, iridodialyses — can happen to anyone. Injuries can happen at jobs or during sports. In older people, eye injuries can happen during falls.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs and symptoms of iridodialysis?
Signs and symptoms of iridodialysis may include:
Double vision (diplopia)
.
Eye pain
.
Hyphema
(bleeding inside your eye).
Difference in
pupil
size.
Traumatic
cataract
.
Glare.
Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
.
What causes iridodialysis?
Iridodialysis typically happens after a penetrating or blunt eye injury. The name for this type of iridodialysis is traumatic iridodialysis. Eye injuries often happen in car accidents, work accidents or stabbings.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is iridodialysis diagnosed?
An
eye care provider
will be able to see that your iris has detached while performing an
eye examination
. They may also do an
ultrasound
of your eye or a
CT scan
(computed tomography scan). They may need to look for foreign bodies in your eye.
Your provider will use
gonioscopy
to check glaucoma-related drainage in your eye. Gonioscopy is a painless test that evaluates the drainage angle in your eye. The test uses a split lamp and a goniolens.
Management and Treatment
How is iridodialysis treated?
In some cases, you may not need treatment for iridodialysis.
In other cases, you may use special contact lenses to help with repair.
You may need surgery, though, if you have a large tear that causes these signs and symptoms:
Double vision in one eye.
Glare.
Photophobia.
Discomfort with your appearance.
Surgery for iridodialysis
Surgeons have used different types of sutures and techniques to repair iridodialysis, including lasers. Surgeons may use a newer procedure that combines implanting an intraocular lens and an artificial iris. You may have to wait until your eye heals from trauma to treat iridodialysis.
An intraocular lens is a clear implant that acts like the eye’s lens to focus light. The light comes in through your cornea and pupil and then travels back to your retina. Surgeons implant intraocular lenses to replace cloudy ones.

Prevention
How can I prevent iridodialysis?
You can’t prevent iridodialysis completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by protecting your eyes. One estimate says that people can prevent about 90% of all eye injuries. To do this, you can:
Use protective eyewear when you’re working.
Use protective eyewear when you’re participating in intense sports.
Wear your seatbelt while driving.
Living With
When should I see a healthcare provider?
If you have any kind of eye trauma or injury, see a healthcare provider. You may want to ask:
How long will it take me to recover?
When can I go back to normal activity?
What symptoms are serious enough to call you or to go to an emergency room?
What can I do to prevent this from happening again?
What kind of appointment schedule should I follow?
Additional Common Questions
Cyclodialysis vs. iridodialysis: What’s the difference?
Cyclodialysis refers to the ciliary body tearing away from the
sclera
(the white of your eye). Iridodialysis means that the iris tears away.
When the ciliary body tears away from your sclera, you may develop a type of
glaucoma
because the tearing disrupts the flow of aqueous humor. This fluid carries nutrients and keeps the eye inflated. When its flow is challenged, it backs up and causes the higher intraocular pressure often related to glaucoma.
Iridonesis vs. iridodialysis: What’s the difference?
Iridonesis and iridodialysis both involve the iris of your eye. But iridonesis refers to the way the iris vibrates when your eye moves. There’s no tear like there is with an iridodialysis.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Eye trauma can cause your iris to tear away from the ciliary body, which can create what looks like a second pupil. It’s important to get help immediately if you have an eye injury or if you notice issues after an eye surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment will give you a good chance for the best outcome.
