Radiation Sickness
Radiation sickness (acute radiation syndrome) or “radiation poisoning” is a life-threatening condition that results from significant exposure to ionizing radiation. It’s most likely to happen after a radiological or nuclear emergency, not from medical procedures. It has a distinct order of symptoms based on the amount of exposure.

Overview
Radiation sickness can cause a range of symptoms at first, which include feeling weak, confused, feverish and sick to your stomach.
What is radiation sickness?
Radiation sickness, also known as acute radiation syndrome (ARS) or “radiation poisoning,” is a life-threatening condition that results from prolonged or significant exposure to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is energy used to generate power in manufacturing, industrial and military settings. It’s used in small doses for some medical procedures.

Radiation sickness is generally associated with acute (sudden and severe) exposure, like from a nuclear power plant accident. Its severity depends on:
The amount of radiation your body absorbs (measured in units called Gray, or Gy).
How long you were exposed.
If all or a certain part of your body was exposed.
Exposure to a high, single dose over minutes to hours is more damaging than several smaller doses given over weeks or months to a small area of your body (such as with
radiation therapy
for
cancer
). Large doses of ionizing radiation can lead to
death
within hours or several months after exposure.
What are the types of radiation sickness (ARS)?
After acute exposure to a high dose of radiation, three distinct syndromes may occur:
Cerebrovascular syndrome
: Affects blood flow to your
brain
. It happens after extremely high whole-body doses of radiation (more than 30 Gy).
Gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome
: Affects the passageway of your
digestive system
. GI syndrome happens after whole-body radiation doses of about 6 to 30 Gy.
Hematopoietic syndrome
: Affects the
formation
of all types of
blood cells
. Hematopoietic syndrome happens after whole-body radiation doses of about 1 to 6 Gy.
How common is radiation sickness?
Radiological or nuclear emergencies that can lead to radiation sickness are rare, but they can harm large numbers of people. Catastrophic incidents of radiation exposure in recent memory include the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Japan in WWII and the power plant disaster in Chernobyl in 1986. In addition to the initial deaths, thousands of people later died from radiation-induced cancer.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of radiation sickness?
Symptoms may begin right after exposure or over the next few days, weeks or months. While symptoms vary based on the syndrome type, the first signs and symptoms of radiation sickness include:
Weakness or
fatigue
.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Vomiting blood
.
Rectal bleeding
(bloody stools).
Diarrhea
.
Fever
.
Confusion
.
Hair loss
.
Tenderness, discoloration, swelling or a burning sensation in your
skin
.
Later, symptoms and complications unfold in stages related to the three ARS syndromes.
What are the stages of radiation sickness?
Each acute radiation syndrome (ARS) has distinct stages. They are the:
Prodromal stage
: Initial symptoms start minutes to two days after exposure.
Latent asymptomatic stage
: A period with no symptoms begins hours to 21 days after exposure.
Systemic illness stage
: More severe symptoms and changes in your body start hours to fewer than 60 days after exposure. Symptoms vary based on the type of syndrome.
Syndrome
Prodromal stage
Latent stage
Systemic illness stage
Cerebrovascular syndrome.
Starts within minutes to one hour after exposure.
Is nonexistent or very brief.
You may experience diarrhea, fever, tremors, seizures and trouble coordinating your muscles (ataxia).
GI syndrome.
Starts within about an hour of exposure and lasts for about two days.
Lasts from four to five days.
You may experience diarrhea, fever, dehydration, a failure of your circulatory system (cardiovascular collapse), electrolyte imbalance and sepsis.
Hematopoietic syndrome.
Starts one to six hours after exposure and lasts up to two days.
Lasts about four weeks.
You may experience infections, low red blood cells (anemia), prolonged bleeding and tiny purple, red or brown spots on your skin (petechiae).

What causes radiation sickness?
Radiation sickness (acute radiation syndrome) can occur after direct exposure or contamination by high doses of radioactive materials. Think of it this way: Low doses of radiation can interfere with cell repair systems, growth and division. But large doses cause cell death.
A nuclear blast, radiation accidents and fallout from nuclear weapons testing can result in direct exposure. Contamination can result from consuming nuclear-contaminated food and water and skin contact with nuclear material.
Is acute radiation syndrome (ARS) contagious?
If someone who’s been exposed to a high dose of radiation is decontaminated — their clothes are removed and their body is washed — they’re not “contagious.” You’re not at risk of radiation exposure from them because the radiation is internalized (inside their bodies).
But you are at risk of radiation poisoning if you’re near someone with radiation exposure who hasn’t been decontaminated. First responders to nuclear emergencies, for example, are at higher risk of exposure from other people.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is radiation sickness diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose radiation sickness by considering the following:
History of radiation exposure.
Symptoms and signs.
Lab test results.
Knowing the onset, timeframe and severity of symptoms helps providers determine the radiation dose and predict future symptoms and complications.
After acute radiation exposure, your provider will likely order lab tests like a
complete blood count (CBC)
and follow your results over time to estimate your initial radiation dosage and prognosis (outcome).
When providers suspect radioactive contamination, they test your entire body with a tool called a Geiger-Muller counter to detect and measure ionizing radiation. To detect possible internal contamination, a provider will wipe your
ears
,
mouth
and wounds with swabs. Then, they’ll test the swabs with the counter. They may also test your pee and poop for radioactivity.

Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for radiation sickness?
The treatment for radiation sickness varies based on its severity. As significant exposure usually results from radiological or nuclear emergencies, healthcare providers and first responders prioritize care based on the severity of symptoms and injuries.
General treatment strategies include:
Decontamination
. Removing clothing and washing your body protects others from further exposure.
Surgical procedures
. Life-threatening injuries may require surgery.
Supportive care
. This may involve getting fluids and
electrolytes
, taking medications to manage pain associated with
burns
or other injuries, and getting treated for any signs of infection with
antibiotics
.
Prevention of thyroid cancer
. Providers typically recommend that all children and
pregnant
women who were exposed take
potassium iodide
to protect their
thyroid
from the uptake of radioactive iodine.
Management of psychological trauma
. Treatments include
psychotherapy
(talk therapy) and medication.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis of radiation sickness?
The prognosis (outlook) of radiation sickness depends on several factors, including:
How much radiation your body absorbed.
How much of your body was affected.
If you were able to get immediate medical care.
Radiation sickness is often fatal. The time to death decreases as the dose of radiation increases.

With survivors, long-term complications may occur. Survivors have an increased likelihood of radiation-induced cancer, including
leukemia
and
thyroid cancer
.
Prevention
Can radiation sickness be prevented?
There’s nothing you can do to prevent emergencies that lead to unexpected significant radiation exposure and radiation sickness. But there are steps you can take to protect yourself if a nuclear emergency happens. You can:
Avoid the exposure area
. Leave (or don’t enter) the area where the exposure occurred.
Decontaminate
. Remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible and store it in a sealed container. Wash yourself thoroughly with soap and water.
Get treated
. Seek emergency medical treatment as soon as possible.

When should I seek care?
An incident involving high doses of radiation exposure is always an emergency that requires immediate medical care. Get away from the radiation source as soon as it’s safe to do so, and get help ASAP.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Radiation sickness is a life-threatening condition that happens after significant radiation exposure. While there’s usually nothing you can do to prevent it, there are steps you can take if you’ve been exposed after a radiological or nuclear event (radiological emergency sounds off). If possible, decontaminate yourself by removing your clothes and washing your body. Then, get medical care as soon as possible.
