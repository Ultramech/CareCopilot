VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Secreting) Tumor
VIPoma (vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting) tumors are rare. They develop in the endocrine cells in your pancreas. A VIPoma can be malignant (cancerous). The most significant symptom is severe watery diarrhea. Treatment may include medication to manage symptoms and surgery to remove the tumor. In some cases, surgery cures the disease.

Overview
What is a VIPoma tumor?
A VIPoma (vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting) tumor is a rare type of
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.
It develops in your
pancreas’s
endocrine cells. The tumors cause chronic (long-term) watery diarrhea. Healthcare providers may refer to this condition as Verner-Morrison syndrome.

VIPomas are very rare. Experts estimate 1 in 10 million people in the U.S. will develop this condition. It can be challenging to live with a
very rare disease
that disrupts your daily life. But healthcare providers have treatments that may cure VIPoma or help ease its symptoms.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of VIPoma?
The most significant symptom is severe watery
diarrhea
that happens even when you’re not eating (fasting) or doesn’t get better within a few days. Other symptoms are:
Belly cramps
Fatigue
Flushing, when your face and chest suddenly turn red for no reason
Weak
muscles
What causes VIPoma?
Experts don’t know the exact cause. They do know VIPoma symptoms happen when the tumor releases unusually large amounts of a certain hormone. This is the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)
hormone
. It supports your digestion. It manages the release of water, salts, enzymes and gastric acid in your
digestive system
. It also relaxes certain muscles in your digestive tract. In VIPoma, large amounts of the VIP hormone trigger symptoms like severe watery diarrhea and belly cramps.
What are the complications of VIPoma?
VIPoma triggers floods of watery diarrhea. Some people produce 1 to 3 quarts of watery poop every day. Over time, people develop
dehydration
and
hypokalemia
(low levels of potassium). Those conditions may lead to serious medical issues like:

Hypovolemic shock
Myopathy
Tetany
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose VIPoma?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical examination
. They’ll ask about your symptoms, like watery diarrhea and belly cramps that last for more than a few days. They may do a
stool test
to rule out other common diseases that cause diarrhea. Other tests may include:
Blood tests
, including tests measuring VIP hormone levels
Imaging tests like a
computed tomography scan
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
test
Management and Treatment
How is VIPoma treated?
Treatment may be a combination of medication and surgery. A healthcare provider may prescribe:
IV fluids to replace fluids and minerals lost because you had ongoing diarrhea
Medication like octreotide (Sandostatin LAR
®
), which controls diarrhea
Once your symptoms are under control, your provider may recommend the following:
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy
A distal
pancreatectomy
removes the body and tail of your pancreas. It’s an option in cases when a tumor hasn’t spread (
metastasized
) to another area of your body.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have VIPoma?
Surgery may cure VIPoma. Medication may reduce VIPoma symptoms. But everyone’s situation is different. What you can expect may be very different from what other people with VIPoma may experience. Your surgeon and healthcare team know you and your situation. They’re your best resources for information.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you’re receiving treatment for VIPoma, contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms don’t go away or get worse. Go to the emergency room if you have:
Severe belly pain
Watery diarrhea that lasts for several days
Dehydration symptoms like feeling weak or lightheaded or you have dark-colored pee
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A VIPoma can cause chronic diarrhea that disrupts your days and nights. It may be a relief to know what’s causing your symptoms. But VIPoma is a very rare disease. It can be frustrating and lonely to have an illness that few people understand. You may feel self-conscious about the symptoms that VIPoma causes. Your healthcare team understands those feelings. Don’t hesitate to ask for help, whether it’s how to manage symptoms or how to live with a rare disease.
