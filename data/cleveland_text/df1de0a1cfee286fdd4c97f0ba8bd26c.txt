A lab technician will examine the sample under a microscope. Or they may place the sample in a culture. A culture is a substance that allows the sample to grow so the fungus can be identified.
If you do have a yeast infection, your healthcare provider may recommend testing for diabetes. High blood sugar levels in people with diabetes are used as food for yeast and help it grow.

antifungal
medication. Your healthcare provider may recommend an antifungal cream, ointment or powder. You’ll apply the antifungal directly onto the skin of your belly button.

You’ll need to
keep your navel area clean
and dry as part of your treatment. Keeping the area clean and dry can also help prevent yeast infections from returning. Exposing your belly button to air may help as well.
In certain cases, your healthcare provider may suggest an antifungal medication taken by mouth. Medications such as
fluconazole
are taken orally.
