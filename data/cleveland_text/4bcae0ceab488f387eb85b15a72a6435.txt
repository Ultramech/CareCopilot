addiction
or compulsive gambling, is a pattern of betting that continues even though it creates problems within your life.

Gambling is any activity where you risk something valuable to win something in return. Common types of gambling include:
Bingo
Casino games
Lottery
Slot machines
Sports betting
Not everyone who gambles develops a gambling problem. But when it leads to addictive behavior, it becomes compulsive gambling.
This mental health condition can affect your relationships, work or school performance, finances and more. It changes how your brain works and can cause withdrawal, tolerance and cravings. This is similar to other addictions like substance use disorder.
The
World Health Organization
estimates that 1.2% of the global population faces this condition. A mental health provider can help you manage it.
Symptoms and Causes
There are several signs of gambling disorder. They can look and feel different for everyone.
Signs of gambling disorder
A major sign of problem gambling is when betting starts to harm important parts of your life. Look out for these signs:
Continuing to gamble even when it causes major problems.
Depending on others to give you money to gamble or pay off your losses.
Feeling upset or angry when you try to stop.
Gambling when you feel sad, stressed or upset (to escape bad feelings).
Gambling to win back money you already lost (“chasing losses”).
Hiding or lying to loved ones about how much you gamble.
Needing to bet more money to feel the same excitement.
Thinking about gambling all the time.
Trying many times to cut back or stop, but not being able to.

Gambling disorder causes
There isn’t just one reason why gambling disorder develops. It’s a complex condition influenced by multiple factors. Both genetic predisposition and environmental influences play key roles, and the condition directly affects how your brain functions.
Normally, your brain releases a “feel-good” chemical called
dopamine
. It does this when you do things like eat tasty food or spend time with loved ones. Gambling can trigger an unusually large release of dopamine, causing intense excitement and pleasure at first. However, over time, your brain adjusts and becomes less responsive. To get the same level of pleasure and excitement, you need to gamble more or with larger amounts of money. This cycle can lead to addiction.
Risk factors of gambling addiction
Anyone who gambles is at risk. Even though the legal age for gambling is 18 or 21 in the United States (depending on the state), it can still affect people below this age group.
You may be more at risk if you:
Act impulsively and seek thrills
Experienced low income or unemployment
Find it hard to make decisions or control your actions
Had
adverse childhood experiences
Have a biological family member with the condition
Live where there are a lot of gambling opportunities
It’s common to have a gambling disorder with another mental health condition, like:
Anxiety disorders
Impulse control disorders
Mood disorders, like depression
Personality disorders
Substance use disorder
Complications of gambling addiction
Gambling disorder can hurt different aspects of your life. It may:
Lead to mental health problems, like depression, anxiety or even thoughts of suicide
Create money problems
Damage your relationships
Get in the way of work or school
Lead to breaking the law
Make you feel like you’re not yourself anymore
People with gambling disorder have
an increased risk
of suicide. If you have thoughts of harming yourself, call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at
988
(U.S.). Someone is available to talk with you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose problem gambling
To diagnose this condition, a healthcare provider may send you to a psychologist or an addiction counselor. They’ll ask you (and sometimes, your loved ones) questions about your gambling habits. This helps them get a better understanding of how gambling affects you.
Mental health professionals use guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (
DSM-5
)
. This is a book that helps providers make a diagnosis. You’ll need to have at least four signs within the past year to meet the criteria.

Management and Treatment
Gambling addiction treatment
The best way to stop gambling is to talk to someone about it. Therapy (also called
psychotherapy
) is the main treatment. A mental health professional, like a psychologist or counselor, can help you:
Manage gambling habits and urges
Cope with stress in healthy ways
Fix relationships
Take better care of your finances
Help you manage any other mental health conditions
The most common type of therapy is
cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT). It helps you understand and change the thoughts and habits that lead to gambling. Other options include group therapy, family therapy and support groups like Gamblers Anonymous.
Your provider may prescribe medications to help manage urges or reduce gambling behaviors. Additionally, they may prescribe medicines to help with mental health issues like anxiety or depression. But there currently isn’t a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication specifically for gambling disorder itself.
Recovery doesn’t happen overnight. It may take time to find the right approach for you. Keep in mind that relapses can happen. These are times when you may fall back into old behaviors. It’s normal and nothing to feel bad about. When this happens, reach out to your support system. They can help you get back on track.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Visit a healthcare provider if you notice your gambling habits are becoming more than just a game — they’re taking over your life. It can feel hard or scary to ask for help, but your provider is there to support you, not judge you. They want to help you feel better and give you the best care possible.
If you don’t know where to start, you can reach out to the National Problem Gambling Helpline (U.S.),
1.800.GAMBLER
. This confidential support line offers resources to anyone who needs more information about problem gambling. It’s available 24/7.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have gambling disorder?
Not everyone with gambling disorder gets diagnosed or treated. Shame, stigma or feeling weak can stop you from seeking help. But reaching out can help you heal and regain control of your life.
Recovery isn’t easy or quick — it takes effort, patience and support. Treatment options like therapy, support groups and even medication can help you every step of the way.
Triggers (things that make you want to gamble) can be everywhere, from games on your phone to sports ads on TV. It’s impossible to avoid all of them, but your care team can teach you healthier ways to cope.
With time, support and the right tools, you can feel more like yourself again.
Prevention
How to prevent gambling addiction
There are steps you can take to lower your risk:
Advertisement
Limit or avoid gambling
: Gamble less often, for shorter periods, and with less money. If gambling starts to take over your life, talk to a healthcare provider or mental health professional right away.
Know your family history
: If your family has a history of addiction, you might be at higher risk. Ask your provider about healthy strategies to protect yourself.
Manage stress
: If you’re stressed, you might gamble to cope. Find healthy activities like exercise, meditation or new hobbies. If you have trouble dealing with stress, consider talking to a mental health professional.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
You just won! But the money and emotions you lose might end up costing you more than any prize. Remember, gambling disorder is a mental health condition that changes how your brain works. You’re not just choosing to gamble for fun — strong urges can make it feel impossible to stop.
The good news is that there are treatments to help you feel more like yourself and take back control. But it takes patience and time.
This is a lifelong condition that you’ll need to manage. Some days will feel easier than others. You’ll need support from friends, family and your care team to stay on track and reach your goals. Your providers can also help you find healthy ways to cope or new hobbies to focus on when you feel the urge to gamble.
Winning doesn’t have to be a gamble. It can mean having a treatment plan made just for you to help you get better.
