H. Pylori Infection
H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori) is a type of bacteria that attacks the lining of your stomach and duodenum (the first part of your small intestine). While most people don’t have symptoms, the bacteria can cause irritation and inflammation, leading to peptic ulcers and gastritis. Treatment includes antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors.

Overview
What is an H. pylori infection?
H. pylori
(
Helicobacter pylori
) is a type of bacteria that infects your
stomach
. It’s the most common chronic
bacterial infection
in humans. It affects more than half of the world’s population. But it doesn’t cause illness in most people.

Helicobacter pylori
(pronounced “hel-i-ko-bak-ter pai-law-rai”) infections mostly occur during childhood. It’s more common in developing countries. In the U.S., about 5% of children under the age of 10 have
H. pylori
bacteria. Infection is most likely to occur in children who live in crowded conditions and areas with poor sanitation.
What happens if you have H. pylori?
H. pylori
bacteria are spiral-shaped and can live in the harsh acidic environment of your stomach by producing
enzymes
that neutralize the acid. This allows
H. pylori
to burrow into your stomach lining, where they can cause chronic inflammation and irritation. They can lead to:
Peptic ulcers
. These are painful sores that can develop in the lining of your stomach or
duodenum
(the first part of your small intestine).
Gastritis
. This is inflammation of your stomach lining.
Stomach cancer
.
H. pylori
infection is a risk factor for stomach cancer. But most people with
H. pylori
won’t develop it.
Symptoms and Causes
H. pylori symptoms
Most children with
H. pylori
infection don’t have symptoms. Only about 5% to 10% do. If they do, symptoms and signs arise from peptic ulcers or gastritis.
One symptom they may experience is a dull or burning
pain in their stomachs
. More often, this happens a few hours after eating and at night. Their pain may last minutes to hours and may come and go over several days to weeks.

Other
H. pylori
symptoms may include:
Unexplained weight loss
Bloating
Nausea and vomiting
(bloody vomit)
Indigestion
Burping
Loss of appetite
Feeling full after eating a small amount of food (
early satiety
)
What does H. pylori poop look like?
In most people with
H. pylori
infection, their poop will appear normal. This is because many people experience no symptoms or only mild ones. But there’s a warning sign to look for in your poop that can be a point to a more serious complication:
blood
.
If your
poop appears dark, black or tarry
, this could mean you have bleeding in your upper
digestive tract
, possibly due to an ulcer from
H. pylori
. Blood in your poop that appears red can be a sign of bleeding lower in your digestive system.
If you notice any signs of blood in your poop, it’s important to see a healthcare provider right away. They can determine the cause of the bleeding and recommend the appropriate treatment.
H. pylori causes
The most common cause of
H. pylori
infection is direct person-to-person transmission.
H. pylori
causes include:
Close contact
. This includes sharing utensils or having contact with vomit or poop from an infected person.
Contaminated food or water
.
H. pylori
can survive in unsanitary conditions. They might be present on food or in water that hasn’t been properly cleaned or treated.
Is H. pylori contagious?
Yes.
H. pylori
can spread from person to person.
H. pylori
are found in
saliva
, poop and
plaque
on teeth. Infection can spread by transferring the bacteria from the hands of those who haven’t thoroughly washed them after pooping.
Risk factors for H. pylori infection
Crowded living conditions and areas with poor sanitation are major risk factors for
H. pylori
infection, especially in developing countries. While contaminated food and water can be a cause, person-to-person transmission is likely more common.
Complications of H. pylori infection
If you have an
H. pylori
infection, you have an increased risk of stomach cancer later in life. If you have a strong biological family history of stomach cancer and other cancer risk factors, your healthcare provider may recommend being tested for
H. pylori
antibodies
. They may suggest this even if you don’t have symptoms of a
stomach ulcer
.
In addition to screening and treatment, your provider may suggest some lifestyle changes. This may mean including more fruits, vegetables and
fiber
in what you eat. Regular checkups with your provider and following their recommendations can reduce your cancer risk.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose H. pylori infection
If your healthcare provider suspects
H. pylori
bacteria may be causing a stomach ulcer, they may order one or more of the following
H. pylori
tests
:

Management and Treatment
How do you treat Helicobacter pylori?
If you don’t have
Helicobacter pylori
bacteria symptoms, you don’t need treatment. If your provider diagnosed you with
H. pylori
, avoid taking
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
. These medicines can increase your risk of developing an ulcer.
If you do have symptoms of peptic ulcers or gastritis,
H. pylori
treatment includes a combination of
antibiotics
and an acid-reducing
proton pump inhibitor
(PPI).
Antibiotics
. Your provider will usually prescribe two antibiotics. Among the common choices are
amoxicillin
,
clarithromycin
(Biaxin
®
),
metronidazole
(Flagyl
®
) and
tetracycline
.
Proton pump inhibitor
. Commonly used proton pump inhibitors include
lansoprazole
(Prevacid
®
),
omeprazole
(Prilosec
®
),
pantoprazole
(Protonix
®
),
rabeprazole
(Aciphex
®
) and
esomeprazole
(Nexium
®
).
Bismuth subsalicylate
. Sometimes, your provider may add this medication (Pepto-Bismol
®
) to your treatment. It protects your stomach lining.
You’ll usually take a combination of
Helicobacter pylori
treatments for 14 days.
One newer medication,
Talicia
®
, combines two antibiotics (rifabutin and amoxicillin) with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) into a single capsule.

What foods should I avoid if I have an H. pylori infection?
Certain
foods can irritate your stomach
lining or slow digestion if you have
H. pylori
. You may want to avoid:
Spicy foods
. Chili peppers, mustard and anything with a strong kick can aggravate inflammation.
Acidic foods
. Citrus fruits like lemons, oranges and grapefruits might increase stomach acid and discomfort.
Fatty foods
. Fatty meats, fried foods and processed cheeses slow down digestion and keep food in your stomach longer, potentially worsening symptoms.
Caffeinated drinks
. Coffee, black tea and sodas can stimulate stomach acid production.
Alcohol
. Alcohol irritates the stomach lining and can hinder healing.
Processed foods
. These are often loaded with preservatives and additives that may irritate your stomach.
It’s important to note that everyone reacts differently. If you have specific foods that trigger
heartburn
or indigestion, avoid those, as well.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms of peptic ulcers or gastritis. It’s also important to see them if you have any signs of bleeding in your upper digestive tract, like vomiting blood or blood in your poop.
If you have a strong family history of stomach cancer, your provider may recommend getting tested and treated for
H. pylori
to potentially reduce your long-term risk.

Also, if you’ve finished treatment but are still experiencing symptoms, see your provider. They may need to retest you for
H. pylori
to confirm it’s gone and explore other potential causes for your symptoms.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s my child’s prognosis (outcome) if they have an H. pylori infection?
Your child needs to follow the treatment plan. This means they have to finish all their medications. If they do, the chance that an infection would return within three years is less than 10%. Also, treatment may heal stomach ulcers. But it can take weeks to months for symptoms to completely go away.
How will I know if the H. pylori infection has healed?
Your healthcare provider will repeat a breath and/or stool test. They’ll wait to test until at least two weeks after completion of proton pump inhibitor treatment. They’ll wait four weeks after your child completes antibiotic treatment.
Prevention
Can H. pylori infection be prevented?
You can lower your risk of
H. pylori
infection if you:
Drink clean water and use clean water during food preparation. (This is especially important if you live in areas of the world known to have a contaminated water supply.)
Wash your hands
thoroughly (20 seconds) with soap and water before eating and after using the bathroom.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
While a diagnosis of
H. pylori
might sound concerning, it’s important to remember it’s a very common infection and often doesn’t cause any problems. In fact, most people with
H. pylori
never experience symptoms. Even if you do have some discomfort, there’s highly effective treatment available with antibiotics. With your healthcare provider’s guidance and a short course of medication, you can eliminate the infection and feel better.
