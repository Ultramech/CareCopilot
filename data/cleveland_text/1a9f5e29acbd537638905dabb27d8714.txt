Abdominal Mass
An abdominal mass is a growth or area of swelling in your belly. Many abdominal masses are benign (noncancerous), but some are malignant (cancerous). Several conditions can cause abdominal masses, including Crohn’s disease, an enlarged spleen and certain types of cancer. Treatment depends on the cause but may include medication or surgery.

Depending on the underlying condition, you might have one mass or several. A mass in your abdomen doesn’t necessarily mean you have
cancer
. Many abdominal masses are
benign
(noncancerous). But if you have one, you should still get it checked out.
Abdominal masses can form anywhere in your abdomen, including the:
Right upper quadrant.
Right lower quadrant.
Left upper quadrant.
Left lower quadrant.
Middle of your belly, just below your ribcage (epigastric region).
Area around your belly button (periumbilical region).
Part of the belly wall itself (subcutaneous and muscle wall).
If you feel a pulsating lump in your belly along with severe pain, seek medical care right away. It could mean you have an
aortic aneurysm
(a bulging area in your aorta). If this bulging area bursts, it can cause internal bleeding and other life-threatening symptoms.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of an abdominal mass?
Whether you experience symptoms depends on several factors, including the underlying condition and the type, size and location of the mass. In some cases, healthcare providers detect these growths during routine checkups before you ever develop symptoms.
If you develop abdominal mass symptoms, they may include:
Abdominal pain
.
Blood in your pee (hematuria)
.
Constipation
.
Diarrhea
.
Feeling a “fullness” in your belly.
Fever
.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Rectal bleeding

Swelling or a lump in the affected area.
Unintentional weight changes (losing or gaining weight for no apparent reason).

.
Pancreatic pseudocysts
.
Peritoneal inclusion. (Your
peritoneum
is the membrane that lines your abdominal cavity.)
Seroma (fluid collection after surgery).
Cancer

Colon cancer
.
Endometrial cancer
.
Gallbladder cancer
.
Kidney cancer
.
Liver cancer

Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly)
.
Enlarged spleen
.
Gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis)

What are the complications of abdominal masses?
An abdominal mass can press on other organs in your belly. This could lead to general complications like:
Pain.
Swelling
.
Bloating
.
Loss of appetite
.
Other complications vary depending on the underlying condition. For example, people with masses due to Crohn’s disease may develop
intestinal blockages
. People with abdominal masses due to uterine fibroids might have
abnormal uterine bleeding
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are abdominal masses diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will start with a
physical examination
. They’ll review your health history and ask about your symptoms.
Next, they’ll ask you to lie down on an exam table while they gently press on different areas on your belly. This can help them locate the abdominal mass and determine if any of your organs feel swollen or tender to touch.
If your provider can feel the growth during the examination, it’s a palpable abdominal mass. (“Palpable” means “able to be touched or felt.”)
Tests used to diagnose abdominal masses
Once your provider completes your exam, they’ll probably need to run some additional tests. These tests may include:
An
angiogram
to check your
blood vessels
and find blockages in your
arteries
.
Blood tests
to check
hormone
levels or look for signs of infection inside your body.
Colonoscopy
or
upper endoscopy
to look at your
digestive system
from the inside.
Imaging tests
like abdominal
X-rays
,
CT (computed tomography) scans
or
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
.
Transvaginal ultrasound
to check for masses in people with uterine conditions.
Urinalysis
(pee tests)
to find any abnormalities in your urinary system.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat abdominal masses?
Treatment depends on what’s causing your abdominal mass. Your healthcare provider will focus on addressing the underlying condition.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for people with abdominal masses?
Your overall outlook depends on what’s causing the mass. Some abdominal growths, like cysts, may not need treatment at all. Other abdominal masses, like
cancerous ones
, require specialized treatment that may involve surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
With such a wide range of possibilities, lean on your healthcare provider to investigate. They can design a personalized treatment plan for your specific situation.
Prevention
Can abdominal masses be prevented?
You can’t always prevent abdominal masses because it’s not always possible to know when you’re at risk. Sometimes, things happen without a known cause or reason.
The best thing you can do is treat and manage any underlying conditions — and see your provider for regular checkups.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Schedule a visit with a provider if you notice signs or symptoms of an abdominal mass, including pain in your belly or sudden changes in your weight or bowel habits. If something feels “off,” let a provider know. They can run tests to see what’s causing your symptoms.

When should I go to the ER?
Call 911 or head to your nearest emergency room if you have:
Severe abdominal pain.
A lump in your belly that feels like it has a heartbeat.
This is an emergency condition that needs immediate medical attention.
These symptoms could indicate an aortic aneurysm (a bulging area in your aorta). If this bulge bursts, it could be life-threatening.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you have an abdominal mass, here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider:
What kind of abdominal mass do I have?
Is it cancerous or noncancerous?
What kind of treatment do I need?
Will I need surgery? If so, how soon?
Do I need chemotherapy or radiation therapy to shrink the mass?
How long will my treatment last?
What if I don’t do anything?
What’s the overall outlook for my diagnosis?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Hearing “mass” and “diagnosis” in the same sentence can send you into an emotional tailspin. What kind of mass? Do I have cancer? Is it life-threatening? If these are the questions running through your mind, you’re not alone. Your healthcare provider is here to find out why you’re having symptoms and what kind of mass you have, as well as what kind of treatment can help.
