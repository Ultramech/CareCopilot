Hearing Aids
Hearing aids are small, electronic devices that amplify sounds and deliver them to your ear. These devices help people with hearing loss improve hearing and speech comprehension, so they can participate more fully in daily life.

Overview
A hearing aid has three basic parts to help it function, including a microphone, amplifier and speaker.
What are hearing aids?
A hearing aid is a small, electronic device worn behind or inside your
ear
that improves access to sound. Hearing aids make sounds louder, so many people with
hearing loss
can interact with others more easily. They can’t restore your natural hearing. But if you’re straining to hear or asking others to repeat themselves a lot, hearing aids may help.

There are different
types of hearing aids
, including prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) ones. There are lots of styles you wear differently. Some are more noticeable, while others are hard to see. They include:
Behind-the-ear (BTE)
In-the-ear (ITE)
In-the-canal (ITC)
Receiver-in-the-ear (RITE)
A hearing specialist called an audiologist can help you find the style and fit that work best for you.
How do hearing aids work?
Hearing aids contain different parts that work together to amplify (boost) sound. Although the specifics can vary based on the type, here are the basic parts of a hearing aid and how they work:
Sound goes in through a set of
microphones
.
The microphones convert the sound waves to electrical signals and process the signals before sending them to an
amplifier
.
The amplifier makes the signals louder, boosting the sound.
The amplifier sends the sounds to your ear through a tiny
speaker (receiver)
.
Some hearing aids have disposable batteries you replace. But most use rechargeable ones. You can charge your hearing aids like you charge a smartphone.

Who performs hearing aid evaluations and fittings?
Generally, audiologists perform hearing aid evaluations. Your primary care physician (PCP) or otolaryngologist (ENT) can refer you. But some audiologists will see you without a referral.

First, you’ll need a
hearing test
. This is a separate appointment that comes before a hearing aid evaluation. This test determines whether you have hearing loss and whether hearing aids might help. What happens next depends on whether you get over-the-counter or prescription hearing aids.
OTC hearing aids
: In the U.S., adults 18 and older can buy hearing aids without an exam or prescription. This type may be appropriate if you have mild hearing difficulty. You’ll have to adjust the devices on your own so that they work for you.
Prescription hearing aids
: An audiologist will help you choose the right hearing aid and customize the settings for you. They’ll test the hearing aids to ensure they work as they should and meet your prescription. They’ll also complete follow-up care for your hearing health and hearing aids.
You can buy OTC hearing aids in most pharmacies, big-box stores and online. You’ll get prescription hearing aids from your audiologist.
How long do hearing aids last?
Most people can use the same hearing aids for six to seven years. This means that in most cases, you can update your existing devices instead of having to buy a new one.
If you have hearing loss, the recommendation is that you get an updated hearing test each year. Your audiologist can reprogram your hearing aids based on the changes.
What are the potential benefits and risks of this treatment?
Hearing aids can help you hear better. They can’t cure hearing loss, but they can turn the volume up on conversations you don’t want to miss. Many have features that can reduce sounds you don’t want to hear (like background noise).
In some cases, hearing aids can ease symptoms that often accompany hearing loss, like ringing in your ears (
tinnitus
). Depending on the cause of your symptoms, amplifying desired sounds may reduce tinnitus over time. Some types of prescription hearing aids are designed to help with tinnitus.
According to research, by helping you hear better, hearing aids can help keep your thinking sharp. Hearing aids can also combat social isolation and depression by helping you engage with others. This is especially important for people who are high risk of
dementia
as they get older.

How can I properly care for my hearing aids?
Your audiologist will tell you how to clean and care for your hearing aids. Here are some general guidelines:
Apply personal care products, like hairspray, before putting in your hearing aids.
Keep your hearing aids away from extreme temperatures, moisture, children and pets.
Replace or recharge dead hearing aid batteries.
Turn your hearing aids off when you’re not using them.
Visit your audiologist at least once a year to adjust prescription hearing aids.

Is there anything I can do to make this treatment easier on me?
One of the best things you can do is to prepare for minor hiccups as you adjust to your hearing aids. It can take several months to get used to them. It’s useful to know what challenges to expect and how you can manage them:
It may be helpful to get your ears cleaned first
.
Consider getting an ear cleaning before your hearing test or hearing aid evaluation. This will make it easier for the audiologist to assess your hearing without delays.
Your voice might seem too loud to you at first
. This is because the microphones are picking up your voice along with other voices. Most people adapt to this over the first couple weeks of consistent hearing aid use. You likely sound louder to yourself than others hear you.
You may get feedback
. Whistling or buzzing may mean that your hearing aid needs cleaning or adjustments. Or it may mean your hearing aids aren’t correctly placed in your ears. Ask your audiologist for help.
You may have trouble hearing in certain environments
. See your audiologist if you’re having issues. There may be a way to turn the volume down on distracting background noises. Remember, though, that noisy environments can pose hearing challenges even for people with typical hearing. Loud and busy settings might still be challenging.

When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your audiologist if you have any questions about how to use or care for your hearing aids. Let them know if they’re not helping enough. They may need to fine-tune the settings for you.
The important thing is not to give up. It can be tempting to set your hearing aids aside in the beginning if they don’t feel right or work as you expected. But the better option is to contact your audiologist to adjust prescription hearing aids. If OTC ones aren’t helping, it may be time to see an audiologist for prescription hearing aids instead.
Additional Common Questions
Can a deaf person hear with a hearing aid?
It depends on what’s causing your hearing loss and its severity. A hearing aid won’t help if the structures inside your inner ear are severely damaged. You may need other treatments depending on the cause of your hearing loss. For some people, a
cochlear implant
is a more appropriate option when hearing aids aren’t helping enough.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Many people who could benefit from hearing aids don’t use them. Especially when hearing loss is gradual, it may not be obvious how much it’s reducing your quality of life. But hearing keeps your brain engaged. It keeps the give-and-take of everyday conversations flowing. It has a huge impact on your overall health and well-being. This is why it’s a good idea to see an audiologist if you think you have hearing loss. They can let you know if there’s an issue. They can advise you on whether hearing aids might help.
