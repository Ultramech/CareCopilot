Overview
What is a language disorder?
Language disorders are when it’s hard for you or your child to use and understand language. In some cases, people with language disorders have trouble using words to share what they’re thinking and feeling. In other cases, the issue is understanding the message behind the words that others say.

You may be born with a language disorder (congenital language disorder) or develop one during your lifetime (acquired language disorder). Symptoms often start during early childhood. But they can happen later if you or your child has a
brain
injury or condition that affects their ability to use language to communicate.
Often, language disorders are lifelong conditions. But
speech therapy
may help people to improve their language skills.
How common are language disorders?
Experts estimate that 1 in 20 children in the U.S. has some type of language disorder. This includes children who have other conditions, like
autism spectrum disorder
or
hearing loss
, that affect their ability to use language to communicate.

What causes language disorders?
Language disorders happen in different ways.
Congenital language disorder
. Some people are born with language disorders. Healthcare providers may call this
developmental language disorder
. Often, there’s no known reason for a developmental language disorder.
Acquired language disorder
. Some people have language disorders as complications of medical conditions. A brain injury or condition may affect someone’s ability to use language to communicate.
Aphasia
is an example of an acquired language disorder.
What are the complications of language disorders?
Language disorders may cause a ripple effect of challenges, from making it more difficult to learn to read to
mental health
issues. Possible complications include:
Anxiety
Behavioral issues
Depression
Types of language disorders
There are different types of language disorders:
Expressive language disorder
.
This is difficulty using words to communicate. It may seem like your child doesn’t know what words to use or how to put words together in a way that others will understand.
Receptive language disorder
.
This is difficulty understanding what people say. Your child may feel anxious about interacting with people because they’re never sure that they know what people are saying.
Some people may have mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. As the name implies, this means they have difficulty using words to communicate and understanding what people say.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are language disorders diagnosed?
Healthcare providers’ first step is to rule out any issues, like hearing loss, which may cause a language disorder. If your provider suspects hearing loss, they’ll refer you to an
audiologist
for a
hearing test
. They’ll also refer you to a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment.
Management and Treatment
How are language disorders treated?
There’s no one approach to treating language disorders. In general, your
speech-language pathologist
will tailor treatment to your or your child’s specific needs. For example:
Congenital
. If your 3-year-old has expressive language disorder, their therapist will use exercises and techniques to help them improve how they use words and sentences.
Acquired
. If you have an acquired language disorder, your provider will focus on activities to help you feel more confident about using words to communicate. They may recommend alternatives, like spelling words by pointing to letters or using apps on computer tablets or a speech-generating device.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has a language disorder?
Many things cause language disorders in children, so what you can expect depends on their situation. Your child may need short-term speech therapy or long-term support.

For example, if your child has a developmental language disorder, they may need speech therapy that targets their specific issues like building their vocabulary. If your child has an underlying disorder that affects their speech, they may need ongoing speech therapy as part of their overall care.

How do I take care of myself or my child?
There’s nothing easy about having a language disorder. The best way you can take care of yourself, or your child, is to understand your issues with language don’t define who you are or who your child is. Here are some suggestions that may help you to help yourself or your child:
Get mental health support
. Children and adults with language disorders often have mental health issues like anxiety. Working with a
psychologist
may help.
Share the situation
. Let your family, friends and your child’s teachers know how a language disorder affects you or your child. Your child may qualify for early intervention programs or specialized support at school.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between a speech disorder and a language disorder?
A
speech disorder
is when it’s hard for you to say sounds. A language disorder is when you have issues using words to communicate or understanding words. Some people have both conditions.
What is a language delay versus a language disorder?
If your child has a language delay, they’re developing typical language skills, but at a slower rate than their peers. If they have a language disorder, they’re not developing those skills and may need help to do that.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Words matter. They’re how we make ourselves heard. Language disorders make it hard to be heard and to be sure we know what people are telling us. If you have a language disorder, you may feel like you’re constantly navigating a maze of verbal twists and turns. If your child has a language disorder, you may worry the condition will affect their ability to navigate the verbal maze. Speech therapy can help. If you or your child is struggling with language, ask a healthcare provider for help. They’ll hear you, and they’ll do their best to help you.
