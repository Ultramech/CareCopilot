Policy
You might visit a podiatrist when you’re having an issue that affects your foot and ankle, or after seeing another healthcare provider who suggests you see a specialist. Some podiatrists have offices in hospitals and health system clinics. Others are part of multispecialty groups or have their own standalone offices.
What does a podiatrist do?
Podiatrists diagnose and treat any
foot or ankle problem
. They perform physical exams and use tests to identify issues that make it hard to move or use your feet and ankles. They can also perform surgery. Podiatrists treat anyone, including children.
A podiatrist can:
Diagnose health conditions that affect your feet and ankles.
Order lab tests or imaging tests.
Prescribe medicine.
Perform surgery on your foot and ankle.
Prescribe medical devices like orthotics (shoe inserts), braces and casts.
Suggest mobility aid devices like canes and walkers.
When you visit a podiatrist, they’ll ask you about your overall health and medications, focus on any symptoms you’re experiencing and when you first noticed them. They might watch how you stand and walk (a gait assessment). They’ll probably ask you about the kinds of shoes you wear most often. Tell your podiatrist what you do for work and any activities, sports or hobbies you do that might put stress or extra pressure on your feet and ankles.

If they find a diabetes-related ulcer or blister, your podiatrist will:

Visit a healthcare provider or a podiatrist if you’re experiencing any of the following symptoms in your foot or ankle:
Pain.
Discoloration or redness.
Swelling.
A feeling of heat or warmth.
New growths or bumps (on or under your skin).
Even though many of the most common issues that affect your feet aren’t life-threatening, see a podiatrist before starting any treatment at home. If you try to self-diagnose or start over-the-counter (OTC) treatments without seeing a healthcare provider, you might make a minor issue more serious.

Additional Common Questions
Is a podiatrist a doctor?
Yes, podiatrists are doctors. Podiatrists have a doctor of podiatric medicine (DPM) degree and attend a specialized podiatric medical school. It’s the podiatric equivalent of being a
medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathy (DO)
. Podiatrists are qualified to diagnose and treat any issue that affects your feet, including performing surgery.
How long does it take to become a podiatrist?
It takes four years to earn a DPM degree, and most podiatrists have a four-year undergraduate degree, too.

Most states require podiatrists to perform three years of training in a residency program after earning their DPM, and a number of physicians also do an additional year in fellowship training.
What is the difference between a podiatrist and an orthopedist?
Podiatrists and orthopedists are different types of healthcare providers, but they often treat similar issues.
A podiatrist is a provider who specializes in caring for your feet, ankles and lower legs.
An
orthopedist
(also spelled orthopaedist) is a specialist who treats injuries and diseases that affect your
musculoskeletal system
(your bones, muscles, joints and soft tissues). Orthopedists are surgeons, but they can also prescribe and administer nonsurgical treatments.
Which type of provider you see depends on the injury, issue or condition you’re experiencing. You might meet with both a podiatrist and an orthopedist.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Podiatrists can care for any condition that affects your feet, ankles and lower legs. They can treat common short-term issues like ingrown toenails, or work with you long-term while you manage a chronic condition like diabetes.
