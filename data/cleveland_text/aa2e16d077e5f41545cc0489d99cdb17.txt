Management and Treatment
How is persistent depressive disorder treated?
The most effective persistent depressive disorder treatment combines medications and talk therapy, or counseling.
Antidepressants are prescription drugs that can relieve depression. There are many different kinds of
medications for the treatment of depression
. You may need to take medication for a month or longer before you feel a difference. Make sure to continue taking the medication exactly as your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have side effects, let your healthcare provider know.
Counseling can also help manage persistent depressive disorder. One type of therapy,
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
is often helpful for depression. A therapist or psychologist will help you examine your thoughts and emotions and how they affect your actions. CBT can help you unlearn negative thoughts and develop more positive thinking.
