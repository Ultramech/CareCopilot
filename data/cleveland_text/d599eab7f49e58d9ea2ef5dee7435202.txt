What happens during pediatric occupational therapy?
Pediatric occupational therapy can help your child learn new skills. This takes time. You can talk with a pediatric occupational therapist or a healthcare provider to learn more about what to expect during your child’s first appointment, second appointment, etc. as there may be differences in how each facility runs its program.
Pediatric occupational therapy evaluation
Your child’s first visit with a pediatric occupational therapist is an evaluation. This is a session that helps your child’s therapist learn more about what your child can do and what skills therapy can help them develop.
A parent or caregiver will be in the same room as your child and the pediatric occupational therapist. It’s important that other siblings aren’t in the same room during this evaluation.
During this session, your child’s therapist will offer assessments that review your child’s fine motor skills and observe your child’s behavior as they play and move. Examples of what your child might do during their first occupational therapy session include:
Writing or coloring.
Eating familiar foods with various textures (crunchy, soft, etc.).
Stringing beads or stacking blocks.
Your child’s therapist will also ask you about their daily habits, your concerns about your child’s development and if you have any questions about what to expect. This initial session can take an hour or up to two hours to complete.
Pediatric occupational therapy sessions
After the initial evaluation, your child’s pediatric occupational therapist will create a treatment plan to identify goals for your child to reach. Each session following the evaluation will incorporate your child’s goals with age-specific activities to keep your child interested and engaged. Activities that your child does won’t necessarily be the same as the activities of one of their peers. Examples of activities include:
Writing the alphabet.
Putting on their socks and shoes.
Playing a game.
Practicing using assistive equipment and devices.

Recovery and Outlook
How long will my child need pediatric occupational therapy?
The duration of each occupational therapy session and the frequency varies based on your child’s needs. Similar to going to school, a child won’t learn everything they need to learn in one day. They need continued practice and encouragement. Your child’s occupational therapist can give you guidance on their progress and the expected time they’ll need to meet their goals.
Is there anything I can do to make pediatric occupational therapy easier on my child?
You can support your child’s goals by practicing with them at home as instructed by your child’s therapist. Each child will reach their goals at their own pace. It’s important to have patience and understanding while your child learns new skills. Don’t get impatient with them if they’re not meeting their goals as expected. Talk to your child’s therapist to see if there are ways that you can help them outside of therapy.

When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my child’s pediatric occupational therapist?

Additional Details
How does occupational therapy differ from pediatric occupational therapy?
Age is the main difference between occupational therapy for adults and pediatric occupational therapy. The goals of occupational therapy are the same across all age groups: to help you build skills that you can use in your daily life. The activities of a child are different from the activities of an adult. For example, a child’s treatment may be school-focused to help them learn in a classroom. An adult may want to improve their skills to adapt to the workplace.
Does insurance cover pediatric occupational therapy?
Most insurance companies cover pediatric occupational therapy. Contact your insurance company to learn more about what’s covered under your plan.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Pediatric occupational therapy takes patience. Your child will need time to adjust and adapt the new skills they learn into their daily routine. If you have any questions about your child’s progress or notice behaviors at home that differ from therapy, let your child’s occupational therapist know. They’ll do their best to help your child meet their goals so they can reach their full potential.
