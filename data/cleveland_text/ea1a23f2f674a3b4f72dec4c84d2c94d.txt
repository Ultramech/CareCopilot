What is a pediatric urologist?
A pediatric urologist is a physician who specializes in diagnosing and treating issues that affect an infant or child’s
urinary system
and genitals, sometimes known as the genitourinary tract. These include organs like the:

A
pediatrician
can treat some issues that affect your child’s urinary system. Not all conditions warrant a trip to a pediatric urologist. But, if a pediatrician believes your child’s symptoms or condition is beyond their expertise, they’ll refer you to a pediatric urologist for more specialized care.
What’s the difference between a pediatric urologist and a urologist?
A pediatric urologist completes the same training as a
urologist
who treats adults but then completes additional specialized training for treating children. Your urinary tract changes as you age. For example, your bladder capacity changes and your ability to hold pee changes. A pediatric urologist may have more expertise in congenital conditions (conditions you’re born with) because they see and diagnose these conditions more frequently in younger children.
Pediatric urologists also know how to help children feel comfortable talking about peeing and their genitals, which can be a sensitive and embarrassing topic. The mind and emotions of a child are different than those of an adult. Pediatric urologists can talk to children in a way that’s supportive and easy to understand.

Why would my child need to see a pediatric urologist?
Pediatric urologists treat any conditions that affect an infant, child or teen’s urinary tract. This can also include their reproductive organs. Some urinary conditions are present at birth, while others occur after birth as your child grows up.
Some of the specific conditions a pediatric urologist may treat are:
Congenital anomalies
or malformations of the urinary tract. This includes conditions like
vesicoureteral reflux
,
hydronephrosis
or
varicocele
.
Kidney stones
,
bladder stones
or
ureteral stones
.
Frequent
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
or blockages.
Undescended testicles
or
swelling around a testicle
.
Inguinal hernias
.
Vaginal irregularities.
Cancer of urologic organs.
Hematuria
(blood in urine).
Bedwetting
or frequent
daytime accidents
due to
incontinence
, or not being able to hold in pee.
Problems associated with neurological conditions like
spina bifida
or
spinal cord injuries
.
Your child’s urologist will perform tests to make a diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include surgery.
What can I expect during my child’s appointment with a pediatric urologist?
A pediatric urologist will begin by going over your child’s symptoms and health history, including any surgeries or prior test results. They’ll also perform a
physical exam
. After that, they’ll decide what other tests are necessary to help them make a diagnosis. This could include tests like:
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging),
ultrasound
or other imaging tests.
Urine tests
.
Urodynamic testing
. These tests measure bladder capacity, urine stream and flow, and more.
Once they determine what’s causing their symptoms, they’ll recommend a treatment plan. Treatment for urologic conditions could include medication, surgery or a combination of both. Pediatric urologists perform surgery.
How do you become a pediatric urologist?
Pediatric urologists earn an undergraduate degree, then they attend medical school. After about four years of medical school, they attend a residency program, which can last five or more years. After residency, a pediatric urologist may go on to specialize in a specific aspect of urology and complete a fellowship. A fellowship can last longer than two years.
Pediatric urologists first receive board certification from the American Board of Urology as a general urologist and then earn a second board certification in pediatric urology, after passing a series of examinations.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s normal to worry when your child’s pediatrician refers you to a pediatric urologist. Seeing your child uncomfortable is also tough. Rest assured, a pediatric urologist is highly skilled in understanding and treating conditions that affect your child’s urinary tract and reproductive organs. They’ll work with you to help you and your child feel better.
