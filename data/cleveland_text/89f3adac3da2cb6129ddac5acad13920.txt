Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's Syndrome)
If you’ve recently recovered from a stomach bug, UTI or STI and suddenly develop joint pain, you might have reactive arthritis. It's a rare type of autoimmune response to a bacterial infection somewhere in your body. Your immune system reacts with inflammation in your joints, eyes, skin or other tissues. Symptoms typically last for several months.

Overview
What is reactive arthritis (Reiter’s syndrome)?
Reactive arthritis (Reiter’s syndrome) is a rare, temporary form of
inflammatory arthritis
that’s triggered by a
bacterial infection
. It causes pain and stiffness in your
joints
, especially in your lower body. It can also cause symptoms in other body tissues, like your
eyes
and
skin
, as well as whole-body symptoms like
fatigue
. But unlike most types of arthritis, it’s not a lifelong condition, and it usually lasts for less than a year.

Reactive arthritis happens when an infection in your
urinary tract
, genitals,
digestive system
or throat triggers an unusual reaction from your
immune system
. Your immune system normally generates
inflammation
to fight infections. But with Reiter’s syndrome, your immune system sends inflammation to places in your body where the infection never was. It’s as if it’s not convinced that the battle is over.
Symptoms and Causes
Reactive arthritis causes joint pain and other inflammatory symptoms, often in your lower body.
What are the symptoms of reactive arthritis?
The most common reactive arthritis symptoms are
joint pain
and stiffness, especially in your:
Lower back
.
Knees
.
Ankles
.
Feet
.
But you may also have a variety of other symptoms, including:
Eye pain
with swelling and
redness
.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, like
stomach pain
and
diarrhea
.
Needing to
pee more frequently
and
pain when you pee
.
Inflammatory
skin rashes
and
mouth sores
.
Achilles tendinitis
and
heel pain
.
Joint swelling,
especially in your fingers and toes (
sausage fingers
).
Flu-like symptoms, like
fever
, fatigue and body aches.
What is the ‘triad’ of reactive arthritis symptoms?
The classic triad of reactive arthritis symptoms is:
Arthritis
(joint inflammation).
Conjunctivitis
(eye inflammation).
Urethritis
(inflammation in your pee passageway).
This triad makes for a quick way to recognize Reiter’s syndrome. But most people won’t have all of these symptoms at the same time. Different symptoms may come and go. You may never have the full triad, and you may also have other symptoms not listed in the classic triad.

What is the cause of Reiter’s syndrome?
Reactive arthritis starts with a bacterial infection. It’s usually a:
Urinary tract infection (UTI)
.
Sexually transmitted infection (STI)
.
Gastrointestinal infection
(such as
food poisoning
).
Throat infection (sore throat)
.
Some of the specific bacteria that can trigger it include:
Chlamydia
.
Gonorrhea
.
Salmonella
.
Shigella
.
Campylobacter
.
Yersinia
.
Mycoplasma
.
C. difficile
.
Streptococcus
.
Reiter’s syndrome begins several days to weeks after the original infection ends, and only in a small percentage of people. It appears that the infection triggers an autoimmune response. This means your immune system overcorrects and begins to target healthy parts of your own body with inflammation. Fortunately, unlike most
autoimmune diseases
, reactive arthritis is usually a temporary condition.
Reactive arthritis belongs to a group of inflammatory arthritis conditions called
spondyloarthritis
. Most of these are autoimmune diseases. Scientists aren’t sure why some people get autoimmune diseases and others don’t. You don’t have to have a severe infection to trigger reactive arthritis. One possible factor is a
gene
called
HLA-B27
. Many people who get spondyloarthritis and Reiter’s syndrome have it.
Who gets Reiter’s syndrome?
Anyone can get reactive arthritis, but you’re more likely to get it if:
You’re a
male
under 40.
You have
HIV
.
You have another autoimmune disease.
You have the
HLA-B27
gene.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is reactive arthritis diagnosed?
If you've recently developed symptoms of arthritis, your healthcare provider will want to see them and hear about them. Certain combinations of symptoms will suggest reactive arthritis. They’ll particularly want to know if you’ve recently recovered from an infection that might have triggered Reiter’s syndrome.
You might have a variety of tests to help make the diagnosis, including:
X-rays
.
Computed tomography (CT) scan
.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
.
Joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)
.
Throat culture
.
Urinalysis.
Blood tests
.
Management and Treatment
How do you calm Reiter’s syndrome?
Treatment for reactive arthritis may include:
Antibiotics
. Depending on the infection that started it, and whether it’s still active, sometimes, a course of antibiotics, like
doxycycline
and
rifampin,
can stop or shorten reactive arthritis.
NSAIDs
. Your provider might prescribe a temporary high dose of a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), like
indomethacin
. After reducing your symptoms, they’ll reduce your dose.
DMARDs
. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like
sulfasalazine
treat inflammatory arthritis by suppressing some of your immune system’s activity. They can help if NSAIDs aren’t working.
Corticosteroids
. While most people with Reiter’s syndrome don’t benefit from oral steroids, these powerful anti-inflammatory drugs can be useful in topical creams or
as an injection
into a joint.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can reactive arthritis be cured?
Reiter’s syndrome is usually self-limited, meaning it will clear up on its own in time (in three to 12 months). In the meantime, treatment can often repress symptoms and may help them to go away quicker. But reactive arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, and no autoimmune disorder is really
curable
. This means it’s always possible for symptoms to return — for example, if you get another infection.
In a small percentage of people, Reiter’s syndrome seems to trigger a more serious and lasting form of spondyloarthritis. They develop long-term joint inflammation that can do real damage over time. It’s unclear whether this is chronic reactive arthritis or whether, in this case, you’ve developed a different disease. One autoimmune disease can trigger another, and many people have more than one.
Living With
How should I take care of myself while living with Reiter’s syndrome?
Even though it’s likely to be temporary, reactive arthritis can have a major impact on your day-to-day life while it lasts. Although many people have mild symptoms that come and go, others struggle with severe fatigue and discomfort. You might need to adjust your daily schedule or how you work during this time.
Your healthcare provider might recommend:
Physical therapy
. A
physical therapist
can suggest ways to gently exercise the muscles and tendons that support your sore joints. This can help reduce stiffness and strain on your joints.
Orthotics
. An
occupational therapist
can suggest ways to support the joints you use a lot or modify the way you use them. You might benefit from wearing a brace, splint or shoe insert.
Hot/cold therapy
. Ice packs and heat packs can help relieve soreness in different ways. Your provider might suggest ice for your sore joints and heat for your stiff muscles, for example.
Power naps
. Chronic fatigue can wear you down, but long periods of bed rest won’t help your sore joints or stiff muscles. Instead, try taking short naps and moving around in between.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Just when you thought your infection was over, reactive arthritis appears as an unexpected and unwelcome encore. It can make the symptoms of the original infection return, along with other symptoms — particularly, joint inflammation. Whether it affects you a little or a lot, it’s hard to live like this not knowing when it will end. But for most people, it will end, and treatment can help until it does.
