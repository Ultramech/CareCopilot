Fungating Tumor
A fungating tumor is an uncommon complication of cancer, usually late-stage breast cancers. While most tumors stay inside your body, these tumors grow through skin, creating a wound. The wounds usually ooze bad-smelling fluid. Your care team will use antibiotic creams and dressings to manage the drainage, mask odors and prevent infection.

What Is a Fungating Tumor?
A fungating tumor (fungating wound) is a cancerous mass that grows through skin. It gets its name — “fungating” — from the way it looks. Like fungi you might find in the woods, these tumors come in all kinds of unique shapes. As the tumor breaks through skin, it creates a non-healing wound that drains fluid.

These tumors are an uncommon complication of cancer. About
5 to 10 out of every 100 people
with cancer get them. Many are breast cancers. But fungating tumors can happen in other cancers that are close to skin. For example, they can happen in
head and neck cancers
and
skin cancers
like melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma.
Seeking care is important because treatments may be available to both treat the cancer and manage the wound.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of a fungating tumor
Fungating wounds come in all shapes and sizes. Some have a cauliflower-like appearance. Some show up as an ulcer that’s shrunken into skin, like a crater. Other symptoms include:
A bad-smelling fluid seeping from the wound
Exposed white or yellowish tissue (“slough”)
Bleeding
Itching
Pain
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Your healthcare provider may suspect a fungating tumor based on how it looks. This is especially the case if you’ve already been diagnosed with cancer. But sometimes, these tumors are easy to mistake for infected wounds or
abscesses
.
It’s important that your provider diagnose it correctly. Fungating wounds need different care from infected tissue that can heal.
To be sure it’s a fungating wound, your provider may do imaging tests and a
skin biopsy
.
What stage is a fungating tumor?
Cancer staging
helps healthcare providers know how far along you are in the disease course. Fungating tumors can happen as part of a locally advanced cancer, like breast cancer or certain skin cancers. Sometimes, it may be part of a cancer that’s spread (
metastatic cancer
).

Management and Treatment
How is it treated?
Treatment often involves a team lift. Your
oncologist
will treat the cancer based on your preferences. Getting treatment from wound care specialists is especially important.
Sometimes, the cancer is curable. Treatment focuses on managing the cancer and ensuring comfort through supportive measures to manage the wound. Depending on your situation, treatments may:
Shrink the tumor
: You may need
cancer treatments
that make the tumor small enough to remove with surgery. More often, shrinking makes it easier to manage.
Remove the tumor
: Seeking care with an experienced surgeon is important because removing these tumors is complex.
Manage the wound
: Shrinking the tumor makes it easier to care for the wound. Other things help, too, like antibiotics and dressings.
Wound care for fungating tumors
Your care team will let you know how to properly clean the wound. They’ll also recommend or apply treatments, which may include:
Topical antibiotics
: Rubbing antibiotic creams, like
metronidazole
, on the tumor can kill bacteria. This prevents infection and reduces odors.
Oral antibiotics
: You may need to take an antibiotic by mouth if you have an active infection. This medicine kills bacteria that have spread throughout your body.
Dressings
: Covering the wound with dressings helps absorb fluid and reduce odors. It can also hide the tumor if you’re feeling self-conscious about how it looks. Dressings are made of different things, like charcoal, honey, hydrogel, polyurethane and silver.
Your provider can explain the benefits of the type of dressing they’ve chosen to tend your wound.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Most people with fungating tumors see their healthcare providers regularly. For example, your provider may visit you at home to help change your dressings. But let your provider know if your symptoms are getting worse. You may need pain medications. You may also need a different type of dressing or more frequent dressing changes.

Outlook / Prognosis
How long is the life expectancy of someone with a fungating tumor?
Every person’s situation is unique, and many different cancer types can lead to fungating tumors. It’s best to meet with an oncology team to evaluate the situation and receive accurate information on life expectancy.
A combination of surgery, radiation or medical therapies can cure some fungating tumors.
Is there anything I can do to feel better?
A tumor that you (and others) can see can make the weight of a cancer diagnosis feel even heavier. You may feel as if your body is betraying you. It’s important to confront these emotions and care for your overall well-being.
You might benefit from talking to a therapist to manage the emotional impacts of the disease. It may also help to let your loved ones know how you’re feeling. For example, you may feel self-conscious if the tumor is in a highly visible place, like your face. Most people find that others are more than willing to provide reassurance that the tumor doesn’t make them any less lovable. Your caregivers can also recommend dressings to help hide the tumor.

Often, people with these tumors worry about the smell. If this is a concern for you, let your wound care provider know. They can recommend ways to mask any odors. Dressings and antibiotic ointments can help. Keeping odor neutralizers and essential oils in your room can also help. But don’t apply oils or any scented products directly on the wound.
Additional Common Questions
What does a fungating tumor smell like?
The smell depends on the type of chemicals the bacteria in the wound release. The tumor may smell like bad cheese, eggs or fish. Some describe the odor as unpleasantly sweet.
The important thing to remember is that these odors aren’t a sign of bad hygiene or anything that you can control. Treatments that kill bacteria and dressings that absorb drainage can help mask these smells.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A fungating tumor can feel like an added burden on top of an already difficult cancer diagnosis. If you develop one, it’s important to have honest talks with your caregivers and loved ones about how it’s impacting your health. This includes your emotional well-being.
Your caregivers can explain the steps they’re taking to manage the wound. They can suggest ways to mask smells, if that’s a concern. The important thing is to surround yourself with all the support you can, so you don’t have to face this disease alone.
