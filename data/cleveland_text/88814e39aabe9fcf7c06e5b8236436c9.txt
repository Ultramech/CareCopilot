What does a radiation therapist do?
Radiation therapists help ensure people receiving radiation therapy understand the process and are as comfortable as possible during treatment. For example, a radiation therapist will:
Help with treatment planning to make sure the right amount of radiation targets the right spot.
Ensure people receiving treatment are protected from unnecessary radiation.
Operate the machines that deliver radiation therapy.
Monitor the well-being of people receiving treatment.
Respond to any unusual reactions to treatment by passing information to the radiation oncologist or other team members.
Maintain detailed treatment records.
Where do radiation therapists work?
Most radiation therapists work in hospitals, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), but you may also work in a physician’s office or outpatient treatment center.
How do you become a radiation therapist?
To become a radiation therapist, you’ll need to:
Obtain an associate’s degree and required clinical training with a radiation oncology team or complete a four-year degree in radiation therapy and obtain a bachelor’s degree.
Complete the certification program offered by the American Registry of Radiation Technologists (ARRT).
Obtain a state license to become a registered technologist.
How many years does it take to become a radiation therapist?

Additional Common Questions
What‘s the difference between a radiation oncologist and a radiation therapist?
A radiation oncologist is a medical practitioner who oversees all aspects of radiation therapy. They lead the radiation oncology team, which includes radiation therapists. The education requirements are different: Radiation oncologists need four years of college, four years of medical school, a year of training in surgery or internal medicine and then four years of training (residency) in radiation oncology.
Do radiation therapists use needles in their work?
They may, but not to do things like give injections. When radiation therapists are preparing someone for treatment, they may use tiny needles to make tattoos that mark the treatment area.
What’s the hardest part of being a radiation therapist?
Radiation therapy is a rewarding career, but it can be challenging:
Radiation therapy requires intense and consistent attention to detail —from simulation through treatment — to avoid making a mistake that could affect someone’s cancer treatment.
They’re responsible for maintaining and operating the machines that deliver radiation.
People receiving radiation therapy often are anxious about having cancer or another serious illness. They may be scared to go through treatment. Showing compassion and empathy is a big part of a radiation therapist’s job.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Radiation therapists play an essential role in providing radiation therapy. The job requires constant attention to detail. At the same time, radiation therapists provide information and often offer emotional support to people receiving treatment.
