Candida
is a common type of yeast. It lives naturally in small amounts on your skin and in your body. Sometimes, the yeast grows out of control. When this happens, it causes an infection called
candidiasis
. Candidiasis is usually a minor infection. It affects specific parts of your body, like your mouth (
thrush
) or vagina (
vaginal yeast infection
).
But an invasive candidiasis infection can be life-threatening. It spreads to vital organs throughout your body, including your eyes, kidneys, heart and brain. It can cause severe complications, like
inflammation around your heart
. It can also damage the protective lining around your brain and spinal cord (
meningitis
).
Without immediate treatment, invasive candidiasis (systemic candidiasis) can lead to organ failure and
death
.
What’s the difference between invasive candidiasis and candidemia?
Invasive candidiasis is a candidiasis infection that spreads to various organs throughout your body. Candidemia is the most common form of invasive candidiasis. It’s when a candidiasis infection spreads throughout your bloodstream.
Candidemia is one of the most common
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
in the U.S. Like other invasive candidiasis infections, it’s an emergency that requires urgent medical attention.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of invasive candidiasis
Symptoms of invasive candidiasis can be hard to determine. That’s because most people who get the infection are already ill or recovering from surgery. Also, the signs can be similar to other conditions, like
bacterial infections
.
Invasive candidiasis symptoms may include:
Belly pain
Chills
Fever
Muscle pain
Skin rash
Weakness or
fatigue
Some symptoms are specific to the location of the infection. For example, invasive candidiasis that affects your eyes may cause:
Blurred vision
Sensitivity to light
Vision changes
Candidemia symptoms may include fever and chills, along with
confusion
and
low blood pressure
.
Invasive candidiasis causes
Invasive candidiasis occurs when too much
Candida
yeast grows in your body and spreads to your internal organs. This can happen when a healthcare provider inserts a medical device through your skin and into your body. Examples include a catheter that drains fluid from your body. Or a
peripheral IV
that delivers nutrition or medication.
Candida
can spread when the medical device picks up the yeast from your skin’s surface and carries it to your organs. Sometimes,
Candida
can transfer from a healthcare provider’s hands to the medical device, contaminating it.
You can also get invasive candidiasis outside of the hospital. This can happen if you’re sent home from the hospital with a
central venous catheter
that you look after yourself.
Is invasive candidiasis contagious?
Invasive candidiasis isn’t contagious from one person to another. But
Candida
itself can travel from person to person and onto surfaces. Something would have to introduce the yeast to your body to cause the infection.
Risk factors
Certain people have a higher chance of getting invasive candidiasis. This includes:
Babies born early
People who need to be
fed through a tube
People who need
stem cell transplants
People on
dialysis
People who receive
antibiotics
through an IV
People who share needles
People who’ve recently had
belly surgery
People who’ve stayed in the hospital for several days or longer, especially in the
ICU
People with catheters, like
PICC lines
People with weak
immune systems
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose invasive candidiasis
If your healthcare provider thinks you may have invasive candidiasis, they’ll take a sample of your blood for a blood culture. For this test, the sample goes off to a lab. At the lab, a
pathologist
will put it in a special substance. They’ll wait to see if
Candida
grows. They’ll also be able to find out the type of yeast in your blood. This can help your provider decide on treatment.
Blood culture test results can take a few days. Scientists are studying new ways to diagnose invasive candidiasis. They want to shorten the amount of time it takes to get results. Knowing if you have an infection and what type of
Candida
is causing it is vital for treatment. The sooner your provider has the results, the sooner they can start the correct treatment.

Management and Treatment
How is invasive candidiasis treated?
Treatment for invasive candidiasis can be challenging. It begins by finding and removing the source of the infection, if possible. This may include removing any IVs or tubes. Then, your healthcare provider will start you on an intravenous (IV)
antifungal medication
right away.
The type of antifungal depends on several factors, including:
Type of
Candida
Location of the infection
How severe the infection is
Strength of your immune system
Your provider will likely start you on an antifungal from the echinocandin drug class. Examples include:
Anidulafungin
Caspofungin
Micafungin
Once the infection starts to clear, they may prescribe another antifungal, like
fluconazole
or
voriconazole
. If you can’t use those or they’re unavailable, your provider may try
amphotericin B
.
How long does it take to cure invasive candidiasis?
Your healthcare provider will test you for
Candida
every one to two days. Treatment usually continues for two weeks after your symptoms go away. They also need to make sure cultures don’t find any yeast in your blood. Severe cases may need longer treatment.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook (prognosis) for someone with invasive candidiasis?
Invasive candidiasis is a serious condition. It can affect organs throughout your body. Even with treatment, your organs can shut down, leading to death. About
3 out of every 10 people
who get the infection will die.

Survivors have a long road to recovery. They may have complications from the infection. This can affect their quality of life. For example, invasive candidiasis that affects your eyes can lead to
blindness
.
You may have many future medical problems related to the infection. You’ll have to work closely with your healthcare provider. They can help you manage the side effects of the infection and treatment.
Prevention
Can invasive candidiasis be prevented?
If you’re at high risk for getting invasive candidiasis, your healthcare provider may prescribe an antifungal
prophylaxis
. This means that you’ll receive an antifungal medication to prevent infection. Prophylactic treatment doesn’t always work. Sometimes, it has risks. But your provider may decide that the benefits of preventing an infection outweigh those risks.
Other ways you can reduce your chances of getting an infection include:
Keeping your skin clean, especially your hands
Looking for signs of early infection, like
skin discoloration
or pain where a catheter or IV enters your body
Making sure that anyone who touches you washes their hands first, including healthcare providers
Your providers should also practice good
handwashing
. If you use a catheter, they should check it regularly for signs of infection.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Invasive candidiasis is a medical emergency. When the yeast
Candida
