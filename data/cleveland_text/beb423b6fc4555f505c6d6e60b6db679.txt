Short Sleeper Syndrome (SSS)
If you have short sleeper syndrome (SSS), you need less sleep than a person typically needs. Most natural short sleepers get six or fewer hours of sleep on most nights. When you wake up, you feel that you got a full night of sleep and have the energy you need. SSS doesn’t pose any known health risks.

How common is short sleeper syndrome?
If you have short sleeper syndrome, you’re a natural short sleeper (NSS). It’s difficult to know how many people have short sleeper syndrome because many factors affect how long a person sleeps.
Researchers continue to study changes in genes (
genetic mutations
) linked to short sleeper syndrome. So far, researchers have found about 50 families that have genetic mutations linked to short sleeper syndrome.
Can you develop short sleep syndrome?
Short sleep syndrome symptoms often begin when you’re a child or adolescent. If you’re a natural short sleeper, you typically need less sleep throughout your life.
Symptoms and Causes
What are short sleeper syndrome symptoms?
The main symptom of short sleeper syndrome is sleeping between four and six hours each night. You wake up even if you don’t have to get up for work, school or other obligations.
Typically, natural short sleepers:
Don’t need to use an alarm clock.
Fall asleep easily when they go to bed.
Feel good and have plenty of energy, even after just a few hours of sleep.
What causes short sleep syndrome?
Researchers continue to study the causes of short sleeper syndrome. They’ve identified gene changes in natural short sleepers. Researchers believe these genetic changes make it possible for people with SSS to feel refreshed with less sleep. Natural short sleepers may have changes in their
DEC2
gene or
ADRB1
gene.

Is short sleeper syndrome hereditary?
Researchers have found the genetic changes associated with short sleeper syndrome in members of the same biological family. Parents may pass these changes to their children.
What are the complications of short sleeper syndrome?
Short sleep syndrome doesn’t cause any known health problems. Healthcare providers don’t consider SSS a
sleep disorder
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose short sleeper syndrome?
It can be challenging for your provider to confirm a short sleep syndrome diagnosis. Your healthcare provider talks to you about your sleep and sleep habits. They may ask you about your:
Bedtime routine (what you do before you go to sleep).
Level of sleepiness during the daytime.
Sleep schedule (what time you go to bed and wake up on weekdays and weekends).
Your provider may do a
physical examination
. They may ask you if you:
Drink alcohol.
Experience
stress
.
Get exercise during the day.
What tests help diagnose short sleeper syndrome?
There aren’t specific short sleeper syndrome tests. But your healthcare provider may recommend a
sleep study (polysomnography)
to check for sleep disorders like:
Insomnia
.
Narcolepsy
.
Nocturnal panic attacks
.
Parasomnias and disruptive sleep disorders
.
Restless legs syndrome
.
Sleep apnea
.
Sleepwalking
.
Management and Treatment
How is short sleeper syndrome treated?
You probably won’t need any treatment for short sleeper syndrome. Natural short sleepers typically wake up refreshed and don’t experience daytime drowsiness.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have short sleeper syndrome?
If you have short sleeper syndrome, you don’t need as much sleep as others. You can expect this to continue throughout your life. Your sleep needs may change as you get older.
What is the outlook for short sleeper syndrome?
Natural short sleepers don’t experience the same health risks as people who don’t get enough sleep. Although the length of time you sleep is less than typical, your sleep quality tends to be good. Good quality sleep helps lower your risk of:
Cardiovascular disease
.
Heart attack (myocardial infarction)
.
Type 2 diabetes
.
Prevention
Is short sleeper syndrome preventable?
Healthcare providers don’t know what causes short sleeper syndrome. The condition may result from genetic changes, so there’s no known way to prevent being a natural short sleeper.

How do I take care of myself if I have short sleep syndrome?
If you wake up refreshed and feel alert during the day, you’re probably getting good sleep. But there are some things you can do to help get the best sleep you can for as many hours as possible. Try to:
Avoid drinking alcohol in the hours before going to sleep.
Get some natural light during the day, especially in the morning.
Go to bed at the same time each night.
Keep your bedroom dark and quiet.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It may feel strange to need only four to six hours of sleep each night. If you live with other people, you may find yourself awake long before they’re up. If you feel good in the morning and have energy during the day, there’s no need to worry. Talk to your healthcare provider if you feel sleepy during the day or if your sleep habits change.
