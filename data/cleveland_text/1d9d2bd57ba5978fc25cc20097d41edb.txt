Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of an anteverted uterus
An anteverted uterus usually doesn’t cause symptoms. It simply describes how your uterus sits in your pelvis. You likely won’t even know your uterus is anteverted.
In some cases, an anteverted uterus can have a severe forward tilt. This can put pressure on your pelvis and cause pain during sex or
menstruation
.
A retroverted uterus tilts backward and is more likely to cause painful symptoms.
Anteverted uterus causes
You’re usually born with your uterus tilted forward. If you’re born with a retroverted uterus, there’s a chance it may shift to an anteverted position during
pregnancy
. Scar tissue from surgery or conditions like
endometriosis
can also cause a retroverted uterus to change to an anteverted uterus.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
A healthcare provider can find the position of your uterus by doing a
pelvic exam
. A
transvaginal ultrasound
can also show which way your uterus tilts.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
There aren’t any health risks of an anteverted uterus. It shouldn’t cause you any pain or affect pregnancy or childbirth in any way.
When should I see my healthcare provider?

Pelvic pain

vaginal bleeding

Additional Common Questions
Does an anteverted uterus make you show sooner?
Possibly. Many factors go into how soon you appear
pregnant
to others. The position of your uterus may be one of these factors.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Having an anteverted uterus isn’t good or bad. It just describes the way your uterus tilts within your pelvis. It’s completely normal if your provider says your uterus is anteverted, or tilted forward. If you have any concerns about having an anteverted uterus, talk to your healthcare provider.
