What is interpersonal psychotherapy?
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a type of
psychotherapy
(talk therapy) that focuses on improving your relationships with others to relieve mental health symptoms. “Interpersonal” means “being, relating to or involving relations between persons.”

During IPT, you’ll work with a mental health professional, like a
psychologist
or therapist, to better understand your emotions and how they affect your relationships. You’ll also learn how to lean on loved ones for support.
IPT usually takes place over a limited number of sessions. Your healthcare provider may recommend taking medication alongside IPT to best manage a mental health condition.
What can IPT treat?
Psychologists and other mental health professionals mainly use IPT for people with
major depressive disorder (clinical depression)
. The evidence for the efficacy (benefit or success) of IPT is strongest for this condition, compared to other
mental health disorders
.
IPT can function as an initial (first) and/or maintenance treatment for major depression for people in adolescence to late adulthood. Psychologists usually recommend IPT once a week for 12 to 16 weeks for major depression.
It’s important to note that several other types of psychotherapy can help manage depression, like
cognitive behavioral therapy
, for example. Every person is unique. You may benefit more from one type of therapy than another.
Mental health professionals may use IPT to help manage other mental health conditions, including:

.
Binge eating disorder
.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
.
Anxiety disorders
.
How does IPT work?
The basic principles of IPT include:
Problematic interpersonal relationships are directly related to your current mood.
Improving interpersonal relationships will improve your mood and mental health symptoms.
Improvement in your mood and symptoms leads to better interpersonal functioning.
In other words, the cycle of improvement feeds itself — the more you improve how you relate to others, the more your symptoms will improve and vice versa.
Your therapist will provide a supportive, nonjudgmental and safe environment for you to talk openly about interpersonal and life issues. They’ll be objective and are specially trained to help you with the challenges you’re having.
These issues may include:
Stressful life events.
Grief
.
Arguments or disputes with others.
Life transitions.
Social isolation.
Your therapist will address these challenges and how they affect your mood or symptoms while helping you connect with social supports and improve the quality of your relationships. IPT therapists believe — and will tell you — that you’re not to blame for your mental health condition. They’ll tell you that you’re in a capable position to help yourself manage depression by addressing and changing the relationship issues that may be triggering your symptoms.
IPT usually takes place over a limited number of sessions (typically 12 to 16). You shouldn’t expect results immediately. IPT usually takes time and sometimes involves uncomfortable work. Think of your therapist as a partner working with you through a process. If you keep working together toward the goals you’ve set, you’ll be able to mark your progress over time.
Risks / Benefits
What are the pros and cons of interpersonal psychotherapy?
IPT helps you become more aware of your emotions, thoughts and behaviors, and how they affect your relationships and mood. After IPT, most people adopt healthier ways of relating to others. IPT can’t make stressful situations disappear, but you can respond to them more positively and feel better overall.
In addition, studies show that IPT therapy combined with medication (like an
antidepressant
) is more effective at managing major depression than medication alone.
Depending on your situation, you might feel slightly more upset during therapy. Your therapist can help you work through these feelings. You can use new skills to overcome negative emotions.
Recovery and Outlook
How long will I need interpersonal psychotherapy?
IPT usually lasts for 12 to 16 weeks. But each person is unique, and mental health conditions are complex, so the length of therapy can vary.
Try not to get discouraged by how long it may take to better manage your thoughts and feelings and have a better quality of life. The important thing is that you’re seeking help. Any progress is good progress.
