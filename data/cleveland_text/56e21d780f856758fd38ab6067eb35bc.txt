Psychoanalysis
Psychoanalysis is a theory and therapy developed by Sigmund Freud. It explores past experiences and unconscious thoughts to help you gain personal insight and resolve emotional conflicts. This long-term, intensive approach can lead to lasting improvements in emotional well-being, relationships and mental health.

What Is Psychoanalysis?
Psychoanalysis helps you understand yourself and grow emotionally. There are four main goals.
Psychoanalysis is a type of
talk therapy
that helps you understand how hidden thoughts and emotions affect what you do and how you feel. These thoughts are part of your unconscious. You’re not always aware of them.

During psychoanalytic therapy, you’ll talk with your therapist about anything that’s on your mind. They’ll ask questions and help you explore your dreams and past experiences. This can bring hidden emotions to the surface.
When you become aware of these deep thoughts and feelings, you can start to deal with them with your therapist. This can help you work through old problems and make long-term changes in your life.
What is psychoanalytic theory?
Psychoanalytic theory explains that unconscious thoughts, feelings and desires shape human behavior. These are things you’re not fully aware of. They often come from early childhood experiences and relationships. According to this theory, they play a big role in shaping your personality.
A key part of this theory is the idea that your mind is made up of three parts:
The id
: This holds your basic desires and instincts.
The
ego
: This helps you make rational decisions.
The superego
: This acts as your sense of right and wrong.
These three parts are always interacting. The way they work together leads to the choices you make and the ways you behave.
The theory also says that people have defense mechanisms to protect their minds from stress or emotional pain. Your mind uses these tricks to help you feel safe. They happen for a reason. Many of these feelings can be traced back to earlier experiences buried in your unconscious mind.

But not all feelings come from a single hidden memory. Sometimes, they reflect deeper emotional patterns, desires or inner conflicts. Understanding these hidden parts of yourself can help you heal and grow.
Who developed psychoanalysis?
Sigmund Freud developed psychoanalytic practice. He believed that bringing unconscious thoughts and feelings into the conscious mind could help people learn more about themselves and feel better.
Freud emphasized the power of talking through problems in order to heal the unconscious and conscious minds. Over time, many other psychologists built on his ideas, adding new insights and expanding the theory.
What conditions does psychoanalysis treat?
Psychoanalysis may help you manage different mental health conditions, like:
Anxiety
Depression
Eating disorders
Post-traumatic stress disorder
This therapy isn’t the first treatment option for these conditions. Your provider may recommend it with other treatments, like medications.
It may also help with:
A lack of purpose in life
Fears
Low self-esteem
The emotional impact of a chronic condition
Relationship issues
Goals of psychoanalysis
The main goal of psychoanalytic practice is to help you understand yourself better and grow emotionally. You’ll also:
Bring unconscious into conscious
: Hidden thoughts, feelings and memories can influence your behavior. Recognizing these can help you understand why you feel or act a certain way.
Gain self-awareness
: Psychoanalysis helps you connect past experiences to your current thoughts and behaviors. This allows you to respond to life’s challenges in healthier ways.
Resolve inner conflicts
: With your therapist’s guidance, you’ll explore past pain, trauma or unresolved problems. Talking through these experiences in a safe space may help you heal.
Find balance
: A key part of psychoanalysis is strengthening the ego. The ego is the part of your mind that balances the demands of the id (your instincts) and the superego (your moral compass). This balance can lead to better decision-making.

What happens during psychoanalysis?
The setting is similar to what you might picture when you think of therapy. You lie on a couch and talk to a therapist or psychoanalyst. But in this case, your therapist sits behind you, out of your line of sight. This setup helps you speak freely without distraction.
You’ll meet with your therapist multiple times a week. Each session lasts less than an hour.
During each session, you’re encouraged to share whatever comes to mind. This could include memories, experiences, dreams, fantasies or feelings. Your therapist may carefully guide the conversation, but there’s no strict agenda. You’ll explore your inner world at your own pace. Together, you’ll work through different feelings or memories so you can meet your goals.
Psychoanalysis techniques
Psychoanalytic practice uses several techniques to bring unconscious thoughts and feelings to the surface. These include:
Dream analysis
: If you remember your dreams, share the details during your sessions. Dreams can offer clues about your unconscious mind. Your therapist can help you figure out what your dreams might mean.
Free association
: You’re encouraged to speak freely about anything that comes to mind. This is without filtering or editing your thoughts. Openly sharing helps your therapist identify patterns that may reveal hidden emotions or memories.
Resistance
: Sometimes, as you get closer to a difficult memory or emotion, you may feel stuck or want to avoid it. This is normal. Your therapist will help you gently explore these. They can lead to important breakthroughs.
Transference
: Sometimes, you may push feelings meant for someone from your past onto your therapist. This is called transference. When it happens, your therapist will help you see and understand it. Identifying it can give insight into unresolved conflicts.

What are the benefits of psychoanalysis?
Psychoanalytic practice offers a range of benefits, like:
A stronger sense of life satisfaction
Better decision-making skills
Greater self-understanding
Improved ability to manage stress and adapt to change
Increased emotional growth and maturity
Relief from symptoms of certain mental health conditions (alongside medication, when needed)
Stronger, healthier relationships
This type of therapy is intensive. It’s a long-term process. It may take years before you see the full results. But the benefits are
typically
long-lasting, even after you stop seeing a therapist.
What are the risks of psychoanalysis?
Psychoanalytic practice can be challenging. For some people, the time and emotional commitment can be hard to stick to. It’s also important to keep in mind that not every healthcare system offers this type of therapy.
Opening up fully to a therapist isn’t easy. Talking about big feelings can make you feel sad, angry or nervous. That’s normal. And sometimes, those feelings can be intense. You may need to face uncomfortable truths or revisit painful memories from your past.
But remember, you don’t have to talk about everything all at once. You get to choose when you’re ready to open up about those things. Your therapist will be there to support you when the time is right.

How long does psychoanalysis typically take?
Psychoanalysis is a long-term form of therapy. It usually lasts several years. Sessions are also more frequent and can occur three to five times a week.
There’s no standard timeline for progress. Everyone’s experience is different. Psychoanalytic therapy isn’t a quick fix. Meaningful change takes time. You may see results sooner or later than others, and that’s OK.
Try not to focus on how long it “should” take. Instead, talk with your therapist about what to expect. They understand your situation and can help you track your progress over time.
If you ever feel discouraged, remember that growth usually comes gradually. Be patient with the process. But most importantly, do the same with yourself.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you’ve ever wondered why you react a certain way or why some emotions seem to catch you off guard, psychoanalysis might offer some answers.
This therapy takes time and patience, like unraveling a knot loop by loop. But with the right therapist, you won’t be doing it alone. You’ll uncover patterns from your past and find new ways to move forward.
If you’re considering psychoanalysis, it’s OK to start slow. Share what feels comfortable and let your therapist guide you through the rest. Growth doesn’t happen overnight. But every session is a step toward deeper self-awareness.
