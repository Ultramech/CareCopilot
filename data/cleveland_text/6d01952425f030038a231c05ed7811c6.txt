Overview
What is amaurosis fugax?
Amaurosis fugax refers to a temporary and painless loss of vision in one (monocular) or both (binocular)
eyes
due to disruption of the blood flow to the
retina
. The retina is the layer of cells at the back of your eye that changes light into electrical signals for your brain to convert to images.

The phrase “amaurosis fugax” combines the Greek word for darkness (amaurosis) with the Latin word for brief (fugax). The loss of sight usually lasts seconds to minutes. It can be partial or complete.
You might hear other names for this condition, including transient monocular blindness, transient monocular visual loss or transient binocular visual loss.
Reasons behind the loss of vision vary from relatively harmless to more serious. Your
eye care provider
will work with you to identify the correct cause, which will then lead to the correct treatment.
Any sudden loss of vision is a medical emergency.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of amaurosis fugax?
The symptoms of amaurosis fugax include shadowing or blurring of part of your vision, or a complete blackout of vision, that causes no pain. It may seem like a curtain is falling from the top of your eye down toward the bottom or that someone is drawing a curtain across your eye from one side toward the other.
Amaurosis fugax, as its name suggests, is temporary (fleeting). It goes away on its own.
It might happen more than once. It’s important to get medical help for any type of sudden vision loss, whether or not it’s painful.
What causes amaurosis fugax?
A blockage of blood flow to the retina causes amaurosis fugax. What’s important is to find out why the blockage has happened so your provider can suggest the correct treatment.

Management and Treatment
How is amaurosis fugax treated?
Treatment of amaurosis fugax depends on its cause. Many of the causes (like stroke) need immediate treatment. Other related illnesses, such as giant cell arteritis, will have their own types of treatment.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
The outlook for amaurosis fugax can depend on what’s causing it. Getting immediate medical help is important, especially for conditions like stroke.
Amaurosis fugax is, by its nature, a temporary condition. However, the illnesses that cause it or that are associated with it are conditions that require treatment and/or management.
If you have conditions like giant cell arteritis or multiple sclerosis, you’ll need to follow your provider’s treatment recommendations for those things. Treating the associated illnesses will also treat the amaurosis fugax.
Prevention
Can amaurosis fugax be prevented?
While you may not be able to prevent amaurosis fugax, you may be able to lower your risk of developing amaurosis fugax by managing your health.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you have a brief period of time when your vision is impaired — if you feel like a curtain has fallen over your vision — you might be experiencing amaurosis fugax. If that’s true, or if you ever have a sudden loss of vision, you should get immediate medical help. Then healthcare providers will work with you to find out what might be causing this amaurosis fugax or if you have another related condition.

Usually, the sooner you get a diagnosis, the sooner you can get treatment, and the better the outcome is likely to be. So don’t hesitate to get help with any sudden loss of vision, with or without pain. And don’t hesitate to ask your provider for help in dealing with the diagnosis and treatment.
