Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)
Hypertension (high blood pressure) means your blood is pushing too forcefully against your artery walls. Many people have this condition but don’t know it because it usually has no symptoms. Without treatment, it can lead to a heart attack, stroke, dementia, kidney disease and other issues. Early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving.

What Is Hypertension?
High blood pressure means the force of blood against your artery walls is too high.
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, means the force of blood pushing against your
artery
walls is too high. This makes your heart work harder to pump blood through your body. Over time, hypertension damages your arteries and heart. It can lead to serious complications, like a
heart attack
or
stroke
. Because high blood pressure usually doesn’t cause symptoms, it’s often known as a “silent killer.”

Healthcare providers measure
blood pressure
(BP) in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Your reading has two numbers:
Systolic blood pressure
: This is the top number. It’s the pressure on your artery walls when your heart contracts.
Diastolic blood pressure
: This is the bottom number. It’s the pressure between beats when your heart relaxes.
What’s considered high blood pressure varies slightly based on where you live. In the U.S., healthcare providers define it as:
A top number (systolic BP) of 130 mmHg or higher,
OR
A bottom number (diastolic BP) of 80 mmHg or higher
In Europe, providers define hypertension as a top number of 140 or higher,
or
a bottom number of 90 or higher.
High blood pressure is very common. It affects nearly half of all adults in the U.S. It’s a major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease
.
Types of hypertension
There are two main types of high blood pressure, based on what’s causing it:
Primary hypertension
: This means your genetics, family history and age are the primary causes of your high blood pressure.
Secondary hypertension
: This means there’s an identifiable cause, like a medical condition, medication or addictive substance, that is making your blood pressure high.
You might also hear about high blood pressure that occurs in certain situations. These types are:

White coat hypertension
: Your BP is normal at home, but high in a healthcare setting.
Masked hypertension
: Your BP is normal in a healthcare setting but high at home.
Sustained hypertension
: Your BP is high no matter where you are.
Nocturnal hypertension
: Your BP goes up when you sleep.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of high blood pressure
Hypertension usually has no symptoms. You could have it for years without feeling any clues. In fact, the World Health Organization
estimates
that 46% of adults with hypertension don’t know they have it.
If your blood pressure is extremely high, you may have symptoms like:
Changes to your mental function
Chest pain
Dizziness
Edema (swelling)
Heart palpitations
Peeing less than usual
Seizures
Severe headache
Signs of stroke
, like sudden facial droop, slurred speech or sudden arm/leg weakness
Vision changes, like eye pain, vision loss or sudden blurry vision
This is called a
hypertensive emergency
.
Call 911
or your local emergency services number right away if your blood pressure is 180/120 or higher and you have any of the symptoms above. If you’re pregnant, call for help if your BP is 160/110 or higher with symptoms.
What causes high blood pressure?
Healthcare providers can’t find a single cause of hypertension for most people. Instead, many factors can come together to make your blood pressure higher. These include:
Being over age 55
Having a history of the condition in your biological family
Smoking or using tobacco products
Having overweight/obesity
Eating foods high in sodium
Not getting enough physical activity
Drinking too much alcohol
In some cases, providers
can
find a specific cause of your high blood pressure, like an underlying condition, medication or substance. Here are some examples:
Conditions
, like obstructive sleep apnea, renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism and thyroid disease
Medications
, like those that manage ADHD, inflammation, autoimmune disease and mental health conditions
Addictive substances
, like alcohol, nicotine and cocaine
Complications of this condition
Untreated hypertension damages your arteries and overworks your heart. Over time, it may lead to:
AFib
: A chaotic rhythm in your heart that affects how well it can pump blood
Chronic kidney disease
: Problems with your kidney function that can get worse over time
Cognitive impairment and
dementia
: Changes to your thinking, memory and personality
Coronary artery disease
: Narrowed or blocked arteries in your heart
Heart attack
: A sudden lack of blood flow to your heart
Heart failure
: A long-term condition that affects your heart’s pumping ability
Hypertensive retinopathy
: Damage to your eyes that may lead to vision loss
Peripheral artery disease
: Narrowed or blocked arteries in your legs or arms
Erectile dysfunction
: Difficulty in obtaining an erection
Stroke
: A sudden lack of blood flow to your brain that can cause long-term neurological changes

Diagnosis and Tests
High blood pressure means your top number is at least 130 or your bottom number is at least 80. Stage 2 is more severe than stage 1.
How doctors diagnose this condition
Healthcare providers measure your blood pressure at your yearly check-ups and other appointments. This lets them see if it’s normal or too high. They’ll diagnose you with hypertension if your numbers are high at two separate visits (with at least two readings taken each time).
What are the different stages of hypertension?
There are two main stages of hypertension:
Stage 1
means your top number is in the 130s,
or
your bottom number is in the 80s.
Stage 2
means your top number is 140 or higher,
or
your bottom number is 90 or higher.
On either end of these stages, there are other categories that providers use to guide treatment decisions:
Elevated blood pressure
is blood pressure that’s a bit above normal but not yet diagnosed as hypertension.
Severe hypertension
is dangerously high blood pressure that’s not yet causing organ damage.
A hypertensive emergency
is dangerously high blood pressure that’s damaging your organs. It causes symptoms and is a medical emergency.

High systolic blood pressure vs. high diastolic blood pressure
It’s common for both your top number (systolic)
and
your bottom number (diastolic) to be too high. But it’s also possible for just one to be in the hypertensive range. You might hear your provider use these terms to describe your blood pressure:
Advertisement
Isolated systolic hypertension
, or high systolic blood pressure
: Your top number is 130 or higher, but your bottom number is below 80. This is more likely to happen as you get older and your arteries get stiffer.
Isolated diastolic hypertension, or high diastolic blood pressure
: Your bottom number is 80 or higher, but your top number is below 130. This is less common overall and typically affects younger adults.
Management and Treatment
How is high blood pressure treated?
Hypertension treatments include
medications
to lower your blood pressure and changes to your daily habits. Common medicines prescribed for high blood pressure include diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Your provider will recommend the right treatment plan for you based on your blood pressure readings, the cause of your high blood pressure and any other conditions you may have.
In general, changes to your habits — sometimes called “lifestyle changes” — are a key part of treatment for everyone. This is true even if you’re taking medicine. In some cases, providers recommend making changes for a while before starting medicine. It depends on your medical history and risk for a heart attack or stroke.
Changes you can make to lower your blood pressure include:

Keep a weight that’s healthy for you
. Your healthcare provider can give you a target range.
Eat nutritious foods
. A couple of examples are the
DASH diet
and the Mediterranean diet. These ways of eating are full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy. They’re also low in sodium and cholesterol.
Cut down on sodium
. Try to limit your sodium intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams (mg) per day. If this is too hard at first, start by reducing your daily intake by at least 1,000 mg.
Get enough potassium
. Try to get 3,500 to 5,000 milligrams per day. Ideally, this should be through foods rather than supplements. Some
foods high in potassium
include bananas, avocados and potatoes (with skin).
Get enough
physical activity
. Ask your healthcare provider what’s safe for you and how to get started. In general, start slow and work your way up to 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Strength training is also helpful for your heart and whole body.
Quit
smoking
. Quitting lowers your blood pressure and has many other benefits. Your provider will help you make a plan. This may include support groups, nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medicine that can make quitting easier.
Limit or avoid alcohol
. If you choose to drink, do so in
moderation
. This means one or fewer drinks per day for
females
, and two or fewer per day for males. The fewer drinks, the better.
Doing these things can also help prevent high blood pressure if your numbers are currently in the normal range.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See your healthcare provider for yearly check-ups. They’ll measure your blood pressure and look for changes over time. High blood pressure usually doesn’t cause symptoms or make you feel any different. So, these check-ups are crucial and even lifesaving.
Call your provider if you notice your BP is higher than usual when you check it at home. They may ask you to come in so they can measure it.
If you’re pregnant, call your provider if your BP is ever 160/110 or higher (but if you have symptoms, seek emergency care instead).

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have high blood pressure?
Once you’re diagnosed with hypertension, you’ll work closely with your healthcare provider to manage it. It’s important to:
Take your medicines as prescribed
. If you have any side effects, tell your provider. They may change the dose or prescribe something else for you. Don’t skip doses or stop taking your medicine unless your provider says you should.
Make the changes your provider recommends
. These might include quitting smoking, eating less sodium or moving around more.
Check your blood pressure at home
. Your provider may recommend that you do this and keep a log. Make sure your device is
validated
(tested for accuracy). Your provider may also ask you to bring your device to the office to ensure the readings match theirs.
Tell your provider about any changes to your health
. They may need to adjust your treatment plan over time. Tell them if you get any new diagnoses, start taking new medicines or become pregnant.
How long does high blood pressure last?
If you have primary hypertension, you’ll need to manage it for the rest of your life. Your healthcare provider will help you do this. Secondary hypertension can often be reversed by treating or removing the underlying cause. Your provider will explain how treatment can help and what to expect.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
The months and years go by fast. It’s easy to forget about conditions that you can’t feel. High blood pressure (hypertension) won’t make you feel any different until it starts to damage your body. But catching and treating it early can help you protect your arteries and heart for years to come.
