Broken Jaw (Fractured Jaw)
Broken lower jawbones are painful and may affect your breathing. You need immediate medical care if you break your jaw. You can break your jaw if someone hits you or by being in a vehicle accident. You may need surgery if you have a severe fracture. Mild fractures heal on their own. Either way, you’ll be on a liquid diet until your jaw heals.

X-rays
.

to check for other broken bones in your face or internal bleeding.
Management and Treatment
What’s the treatment for a broken jaw?
Treatment depends on whether the jaw fracture was mild or more severe, meaning your lower jawbone fractured in more than one place:

. Your healthcare provider may prescribe that you stay on a liquid diet for four to six weeks.
Severe fracture treatment.
Your provider may do surgery, putting metal plates or bars on the broken area of your jaw. The plates or bars hold the bone in place to allow it to heal. Your surgeon may also hold your jaw closed with wires or elastics to aid in healing.
What are treatment side effects?
One study suggests that hardware failure and infection are the most common treatment side effects. Hardware failure happens when the plates, screws and wires break or don’t work like they should.

Go on a liquid diet if you had surgery, drinking fluids through a straw. You won’t be able to brush your teeth and may need to use a dental rinse. If you didn’t need surgery, you may need to have a soft-food-only diet.
Place ice packs on your jaw. This will help with swelling.
Take
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) to ease pain and swelling.
If your jaw is wired shut, remember to carry a wire cutter to cut the wire if you feel like you’re going to vomit, or you feel like you’re choking on something you need to spit out.
Place your fist or hand under your chin when you yawn or sneeze so that your jaw doesn’t move.
