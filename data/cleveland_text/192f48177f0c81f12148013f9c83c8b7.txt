Policy
Many people work with a physical therapist while they’re recovering from an injury or surgery. But rehabilitation (rehab) isn’t the only time you might work with a physiotherapist. They can help you move more confidently and safely to treat certain health conditions or prevent injuries.
A physical therapist can be part of your care team with a
primary healthcare provider
to treat and prevent issues that make it hard to move.
Are physical therapists doctors?
Physical therapists aren’t medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathy (DO). They can’t diagnose health conditions, prescribe medicine or perform surgeries.
A physiotherapist will work with you to improve your movement, usually after you’ve seen another healthcare provider for a diagnosis. You can also visit a physical therapist directly without a referral in the U.S.
What does DPT mean?
DPT stands for doctor of physical therapy — the degree physical therapists earn that means they’re trained and qualified.
It usually takes around three years to earn a DPT. Physical therapists also have an undergraduate bachelor’s degree.
In the U.S., all physical therapists must pass the National Physical Therapy Examination before they can practice.

Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between a physical therapist vs. an occupational therapist?
Physical therapists and
occupational therapists
are both healthcare providers who help you move your body. The biggest difference between them is the type of therapy they perform.
Physiotherapists usually treat a specific area or part of your body. An occupational therapist will work with you to overcome challenges that are mental and social, as well as strengthen or heal your physical body. You might work with both a physical therapist and an occupational therapist at the same time to manage different symptoms or help your recovery.
What are the qualities of a good physical therapist (physiotherapist)?
Everyone’s definition of a good physical therapist is different, and everyone has unique preferences. But in general, you should work with someone who supports you and makes you feel safe.
Physical therapy
can be hard work, so it’s important to find a physical therapist you feel comfortable around. You should feel confident to ask your therapist questions.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A physiotherapist can be an important member of your healthcare team. They’ll help you improve how much (and how comfortably) you can move your body.
You might need to visit a physical therapist temporarily while you’re recovering from an injury, or as part of your rehab after surgery. Other people work with physical therapists to manage long-term conditions that affect their ability to move and control their bodies.
Talk to a healthcare provider if you notice any new symptoms like pain or stiffness — especially if you’re having trouble moving a part of your body the way you usually can. They might suggest you meet with a physiotherapist to manage these kinds of issues.
