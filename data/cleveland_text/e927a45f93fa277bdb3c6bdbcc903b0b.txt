Developmental Language Disorder
Developmental language disorders affect your ability to use language and communicate. Symptoms like difficulty answering questions or following instructions start in childhood. While it’s a lifelong condition, treatment with a speech pathologist can help.

What Is Developmental Language Disorder?
Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a communication disorder that affects how you learn, understand and use language. These difficulties aren’t explained by hearing loss, autism or limited exposure to language. Instead, DLD is caused by brain differences that affect language development.

DLD is one of the most common
developmental disorders
, affecting about
7% of children
in the U.S. That means, in a typical classroom of 28 kids, two may have DLD. Because the signs aren’t always obvious, it’s often called a “hidden condition.”
Developmental language disorders are lifelong conditions. But with the right support and treatment, children can continue building their language skills over time.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of developmental language disorder?
Most children with DLD are diagnosed around age 5. The condition affects both understanding and using language. Symptoms can vary, but common signs include:
Difficulty answering questions
Trouble following directions
Challenges expressing ideas clearly
Struggling to find the right words (words may feel “on the tip of the tongue”)
Trouble learning new words
Difficulty telling stories in a clear, organized way
Problems relating to peers
Discomfort in social situations
Trouble paying attention
DLD doesn’t only affect children. Adults with DLD may experience:
Challenges with figurative language (like idioms or metaphors)
Difficulty understanding what they read
Trouble using complex sentences
People with DLD are also four times more likely to have trouble solving math problems.
Developmental language disorder causes
Usually, DLD doesn’t have a clear cause. But certain risk factors can increase the chances of your child developing it. These include:

Environment:
Children with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, or those born
early
or at a
low birth weight
, may have a higher risk.
Genetics
:
DLD is more likely if a close family member with the condition (like a parent, sibling or grandparent) has it. Sometimes, a random
gene change
can also play a role.
Other developmental conditions:
Conditions like
dyslexia
or
autism
can affect how your child learns language. When DLD occurs with these conditions, it’s called “language disorder associated with dyslexia” or “language disorder associated with autism spectrum disorder.”
Complications of this condition
DLD doesn’t just impact language. It can also affect your child’s learning, emotions and social life. Kids with DLD may:
Avoid social situations because they feel awkward or embarrassed
Have trouble making or keeping friends
Struggle in school
They may also have other conditions, like dyslexia, dysgraphia, ADHD or hearing loss, which can add to these challenges.
If you notice any issues, talk to your child’s pediatrician. Early support is best. But it’s never too late to get help.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose DLD
A
speech-language pathologist
(SLP) will check how your child understands and uses language. During the evaluation, they may:
Ask your child questions about their daily life.
Check their
vision
and
hearing
.
Give written or spoken language tests.
Talk with parents, caregivers, guardians or teachers.
Watch how your child acts in social settings.
Management and Treatment
How is developmental language disorder treated?
Children with DLD usually work with a speech-language pathologist. Treatment depends on your child’s specific needs, but it can help them:
Build social skills
Better understand language
Improve reading, speaking and writing
Organize their thoughts and ideas
Follow directions more easily
Many children with DLD also qualify for school-based support. An SLP can help your family access services like:
An Individualized Education Plan (IEP)
In-school therapy (
speech
,
physical
,
occupational
or
behavioral
)
One-on-one support from a personal aide
When should my child see a healthcare provider?
If you think your child might have DLD, ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a speech-language pathologist. Early intervention is best. An SLP can explain key
developmental milestones
and create a treatment plan tailored to your child’s needs.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for people with this disorder?
DLD can bring lifelong challenges, but with the right support, children can build strong communication skills. Starting treatment early is best. But help at any age can still make a big difference. Without treatment, DLD may lead to more difficulties in school, relationships and emotional well-being.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Developmental language disorder (DLD) can be challenging — not just for children, but for their families, too. Understanding what DLD is, how it affects learning and communication, and what treatment options are available can make a big difference.

Every child’s journey with DLD is unique. With the right support — at home, in school and from professionals — kids with DLD can grow their communication skills and build confidence.
The more you know, the more prepared you’ll be to support your child or loved one. Keep asking questions, keep learning and don’t hesitate to reach out to a healthcare provider if you have concerns.
