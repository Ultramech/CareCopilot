Burkitt Lymphoma
Burkitt lymphoma is a rare, fast-growing cancer. It typically affects children and, less frequently, young adults. Burkitt lymphoma symptoms come on suddenly and quickly get worse. Healthcare providers often treat Burkitt lymphoma with intensive chemotherapy. Most of the time, this cancer goes into long-term remission after treatment.

What Is Burkitt lymphoma?
Burkitt lymphoma is a rare, fast-growing
cancer of B cells
— a type of
white blood cell
. It’s a form of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
that most often affects children and young adults. Other names for this condition include Burkitt’s disease, Burkitt’s lymphoma and Burkitt’s tumor.

It typically starts in
lymph nodes
in your abdomen or pelvis, but it can also spread to your:
Belly
Bone marrow
Gastrointestinal tract
Jaw
Spleen
Throat
Tonsils
Because it grows so fast, Burkitt lymphoma can be life-threatening. But with quick treatment, many people go into long-term
remission
. That means symptoms go away and stay away.
Types of Burkitt lymphoma
There are three types:
Endemic:
This type is most common in parts of Africa and is linked to
Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV).
Sporadic:
This type is common in the U.S., especially in kids. It makes up over 40% of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases.
Immunodeficiency-related:
This affects people with
weakened immune systems
, like those with
HIV/AIDS
.
How common is Burkitt lymphoma?
In the U.S., sporadic Burkitt lymphoma affects about
4 in 1 million children
under 16. It makes up
1% to 2%
of adult lymphomas.
Children are more likely to get it, usually between the ages of 3 and 12.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of Burkitt lymphoma
Symptoms can appear suddenly and include:
Belly pain
, nausea or vomiting
Fever, tiredness and
night sweats
Loss of appetite
and
unintended weight loss
Swollen lymph nodes
These symptoms can look like common illnesses, but if they get worse, see a healthcare provider. Burkitt
tumors
can double in size within days.

Burkitt lymphoma causes
Experts don’t know exactly what causes Burkitt lymphoma. It’s linked to
changes
(variations) in a
gene
called
MYC
, which helps control cell growth. A type of genetic glitch, called translocation, can cause this gene to become overactive.
In the U.S., some people who have Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) also have Burkitt lymphoma. But not everyone who has EBV develops Burkitt lymphoma.
Complications of this condition
Possible complications include:
Low blood cell counts, needing transfusion of blood products
Tumor lysis syndrome
Weakened immunity
Tell your provider if your symptoms become hard to manage.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose Burkitt lymphoma
To diagnose Burkitt lymphoma, your provider may start with a
lymph node biopsy
. Other tests may include:
CT scan
:
Looks for tumors in your chest, belly or pelvis
PET scan
:
Highlights areas with cancer
Bone marrow biopsy
:
Checks if cancer is in the marrow
Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)
:
Looks for cancer cells in spinal fluid
Stages of Burkitt lymphoma
Healthcare providers use stages to show how far the cancer has spread:
Stage I (1):
One area or lymph node is affected.
Stage II (2):
Cancer is in two or more areas on the same side of your breathing muscle (diaphragm).
Stage III (3):
Cancer is on both sides of your diaphragm.
Stage IV (4):
Cancer has spread outside your lymph system (like to your liver, lungs or bone marrow).
Management and Treatment
How is Burkitt lymphoma treated?
Because Burkitt lymphoma grows fast, treatment needs to start quickly. Options include:
Chemotherapy
:
Main treatment, often intense and started right away
Immunotherapy
:
Helps your immune system find and attack cancer
Radiation therapy
:
Sometimes used with chemo, mostly for adults
Stem cell transplant
:
May help if cancer returns after treatment
Surgery:
Used in rare cases, like when a tumor blocks your intestines
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Your provider will schedule regular follow-ups to monitor your health. These appointments may include
blood tests
and CT scans.
Call your provider if you or your child has:
Chest pain
or
shortness of breath
Fever
over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius)
Nosebleeds
or
bleeding gums
Pain that won’t go away
Pale skin
or easy
bruising
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you or your child receives a Burkitt lymphoma diagnosis, here are some questions you might want to ask:
Where is the cancer?
What stage is it?
What treatment do you recommend?
Will I or my child be able to work or go to school?
Will more tests be needed?
What’s the outlook?

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have Burkitt lymphoma?
Burkitt lymphoma is
curable
in many cases. It responds well to treatment, especially in kids and teens. Children tend to handle chemotherapy better than adults, who may have other health issues that can make treatment harder.

Burkitt lymphoma survival rates
While Burkitt lymphoma is aggressive, many people respond well to treatment. Here’s what the
survival rates
typically look like:
Early-stage in kids:
Over 90% survive long-term.
Advanced-stage in kids:
80% to 90% survive.
Adults:
Over 50%
go into remission with treatment.
These are only averages. Your outcome may be different, so talk to your provider for more personal details.
Self-care tips
Treatment can be tough, but there are ways to cope:
