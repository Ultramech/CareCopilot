Overview
Adenocarcinoma cancers starts in the glands that line your organs and can affect several different areas of your body and organs.
What is adenocarcinoma?
Adenocarcinoma is a type of
cancer
that starts in the glands that line your organs. These glands secrete mucus and digestive juices. If your glandular epithelial cells begin to change or grow out of control,
tumors
can form.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of cancer involving your organs. It can affect several different areas of your body, most commonly the:
Breast
.
Colon
/
rectum
.
Esophagus
.
Lungs
.
Pancreas
.
Prostate
.
Stomach
.
Can adenocarcinoma spread to other parts of my body?
Even though adenocarcinomas begin growing in the glands that line your organs, they can eventually spread to other parts of your body. This may include your
brain
,
liver
,
lymph nodes
,
bone
and/or
bone marrow
.
When adenocarcinoma spreads, providers refer to it in one of two ways:
Invasive adenocarcinoma
, when cancer cells spread to surrounding tissues and nearby lymph nodes.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma
,
when cancer cells break away from the original tumor and travel to distant parts of your body via your
bloodstream
or
lymphatic system
.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of adenocarcinoma?
Adenocarcinoma symptoms vary widely depending on which type you have. Some of the most common overlapping symptoms are:
Pain near the affected organ.
Blood
in bodily fluids (like your pee, poop or
saliva
).
Changes in your appetite or weight.
Bloating
.
Lung adenocarcinoma
The first symptom of adenocarcinoma of the lungs is usually a
chronic cough
. You may cough up saliva and mucus with small amounts of blood. Other symptoms may include:
Shortness of breath
.
Chest pain
.
Wheezing
.
Hoarseness
.

Breast adenocarcinoma
Healthcare providers usually find adenocarcinoma of the breast on a
mammogram
in the early stages before most symptoms start. Other times, you may notice certain warning signs, including:
A change in a breast’s shape or size.
Discolored, flaky, dimpled or uneven skin on your breast or nipple.
Bloody
fluid leaking from your nipple
.
Colorectal adenocarcinoma
You may not notice any symptoms if the tumor hasn’t grown big enough. Even though colorectal adenocarcinoma typically causes
bleeding in your stool
(poop), the amount may be too small to see. Here are some other symptoms to watch for:
Abdominal pain
.
Diarrhea
.
Constipation
.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Most people who have adenocarcinoma of the pancreas don’t have symptoms until the late stages. The first warning signs are usually stomach pain and
unintentional weight loss
. Other symptoms include:
Back pain
.
Heartburn
.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Poop that floats.
Prostatic adenocarcinoma
Most of the time, there are no early symptoms of prostate adenocarcinoma. In the advanced stages, you may develop
erectile dysfunction
or notice that you pee more than usual.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma
Symptoms of esophageal adenocarcinoma may include:
Difficulty swallowing
.
Indigestion
.
Coughing.
Hoarseness.
Pressure or burning in your chest.
Gastric (stomach) adenocarcinoma
Stomach adenocarcinoma symptoms may include:
Feeling full after eating small amounts of food.
Difficulty swallowing.
Nausea.
Indigestion
.
What causes adenocarcinoma?
Adenocarcinoma happens when cells in the glands that line your organs divide uncontrollably and start to spread. Experts aren’t always sure why some people develop adenocarcinoma, but there are a few risk factors to consider:
Smoking
or
vaping
: Tobacco use is the primary cause of adenocarcinoma and other types of cancer.
Family history
: If you have a biological parent, sibling or grandparent with adenocarcinoma, you’re more likely to develop it.
Alcohol
: How often you drink beverages containing alcohol may contribute to adenocarcinoma, especially if you have a family history of the condition.
Toxin exposure
: Harmful toxins in your home or work environment can also cause adenocarcinoma.
A
body mass index (BMI)
greater than 25 (having overweight/
obesity
)
: Carrying extra weight may be a risk factor for certain types of cancer, including adenocarcinoma.
Previous radiation therapy
: If you’ve had radiation therapy in the past, you have a higher risk of developing adenocarcinoma.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is adenocarcinoma diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will start with a
physical exam
. They’ll ask about your symptoms and run some tests. These tests may include:
Advertisement
Blood tests
: Your blood can show signs of cancer, like high levels of certain enzymes or
low red blood cell count
.
CT scan
: This procedure takes detailed, three-dimensional images of the tissues inside your body. A CT scan helps your healthcare provider see if there’s anything abnormal going on.
MRI
: This imaging test uses radio waves and magnets to capture images of your organs and tissues.
Biopsy
: A healthcare provider takes a small sample of tissue from the affected organ. They’ll send it to a
pathologist
who’ll check it for cancer cells. A biopsy can tell you whether your cancer is in one organ or if it has spread and how much it has grown.
How do doctors determine cancer grade?
Healthcare providers look at cell differentiation to determine what grade of adenocarcinoma you have. Differentiation relates to how abnormal your cancer cells look under a microscope:
Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma
: Low-grade cancer that tends to grow and spread slowly.
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
: Intermediate-grade cancer that grows faster than well-differentiated cells.
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
: High-grade cancer that spreads faster than moderately differentiated cells.
Adenocarcinoma stages
Once you receive a diagnosis, your healthcare provider will stage the cancer. How they stage it can differ depending on the location. But here are some general guidelines:
Advertisement
Stage 0 adenocarcinoma
: The cancer hasn’t spread beyond where it started. This is adenocarcinoma in situ (meaning “in the original place”).
Stage I (1) adenocarcinoma
: Cancer cells have spread into some surrounding tissue but haven’t spread to lymph nodes or other organs.
Stage II (2) adenocarcinoma
: The cancer has spread deeper into surrounding tissue and possibly to nearby lymph nodes. It hasn’t spread to other organs.
Stage III (3) adenocarcinoma
: Cancer cells have spread into deeper layers of tissue, nearby lymph nodes and possibly into distant lymph nodes. The tumor may grow larger at this stage.
Stage IV (4) adenocarcinoma
: The cancer has traveled from the original location to other, distant parts of your body. This is
metastatic
adenocarcinoma.
Management and Treatment
How is adenocarcinoma treated?
Treatment depends on the location, size and type of tumor. It also depends on whether the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. There are three main adenocarcinoma treatments:
Surgery
. This is usually the first line of treatment for adenocarcinoma. The goal of surgery is to remove cancer and some of the surrounding tissue.
Chemotherapy
. This treatment involves using drugs to kill cancer cells. Your healthcare provider may recommend chemotherapy in a specific area or throughout your entire body.
Radiation therapy
. This uses imaging to target adenocarcinoma tumors and leave healthy tissues intact. Providers often use radiation therapy in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy.

Side effects of adenocarcinoma surgery
Some of the general side effects after adenocarcinoma surgery include:
Loss of appetite
.
Nausea or vomiting.
Pain or discomfort.
Tiredness.
Be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you experience any side effects. They can help you find ways to ease your symptoms and make you more comfortable.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have adenocarcinoma?
Adenocarcinoma outlook varies depending on the type, location and size of the tumor. Cancers that are hard to diagnose in the early stages are more likely to be fatal compared to cancers that are detectable early on.
Treatment can successfully manage adenocarcinoma in many cases. Survival rates vary depending on the type of cancer, its location and stage.
Adenocarcinoma survival rate
Survival rates depend on the specific type of adenocarcinoma, its stage and its location. Keep in mind that medical professionals estimate survival rates according to other people’s outcomes. They can’t predict what will happen in your specific case, but they can give you a better understanding of your situation.
A relative survival rate compares people with the same type and stage of cancer to the general population. It shows whether the disease shortens life. The five-year relative survival rate is a measure of how many people are still alive five years after their diagnosis. The following statistics are based on U.S. research:
