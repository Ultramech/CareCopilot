Leiomyosarcoma
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. It’s a rare, aggressive cancer that starts in the smooth muscles of your hollow organs (like your bladder, stomach, uterus, intestines or blood vessels). Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and targeted therapy. Outlook is more favorable when detected and treated early.

Overview
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) forms in smooth muscles and can occur in several areas of your body.
What is leiomyosarcoma?
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare, aggressive
cancer
that forms in
smooth muscles
. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles located in various parts of your body. You have smooth muscles in your hollow organs, including your:

LMS cancer is a type of
soft tissue sarcoma
. It grows quickly and can double in size in as little as one month. The cancer cells travel through your bloodstream and can spread to any soft tissue in your body.
Some people don’t develop LMS symptoms until the disease reaches an advanced stage. In these cases, leiomyosarcoma is life-threatening. But when it’s detected and treated early, recovery is possible.
A cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming. Lean on your healthcare team. They can recommend resources and support groups that may help you on your journey.
Types of leiomyosarcoma
There are three subtypes of leiomyosarcoma:
Somatic soft tissue LMS
. This affects your connective tissue. It’s the most common form of LMS. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is one example of somatic soft tissue LMS.
Cutaneous or subcutaneous LMS
.
This involves piloerector muscles in your
skin
and
eyes
. Your piloerector muscles give your skin goosebumps and make your pupils dilate.
LMS of a vascular origin
.
This forms in a major blood vessel, like your
pulmonary arteries
, inferior
vena cava
or peripheral arteries. It’s the rarest form of LMS.
How common is leiomyosarcoma?
In the United States, about 15,000 people receive a soft tissue sarcoma diagnosis every year. Leiomyosarcoma accounts for 10% to 20% of those cases. About 1 in every 100,000 people in the U.S. develops LMS cancer.

Leiomyosarcoma can affect anyone. But it’s most common in
females
over age 5.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of leiomyosarcoma?
Leiomyosarcoma symptoms vary depending on the size and location of the
tumor
. Some people don’t experience symptoms early on, but may notice certain signs as the tumor grows, like:
A firm, painless lump
Abdominal bloating
Fever
Nausea
and
vomiting
Pain
Tiredness
Weight loss
Leiomyosarcoma in your
digestive system
may cause:
Abdominal pain
Black stools
(from blood in your poop)
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Uterine leiomyosarcoma can cause:
Abnormal uterine bleeding
Frequent urination
Vaginal discharge
What causes leiomyosarcoma?
Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes leiomyosarcoma. It could be hereditary (meaning you inherited
altered genes
from your parents), or it could be because your own genes changed, causing normal cells to grow out of control and become cancer cells.
Researchers have found links between LMS and these genetic conditions:
Gardner syndrome
Gorlin syndrome
Hereditary
retinoblastoma
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
Tuberous sclerosis
Werner syndrome
Diagnosis and Tests
How is leiomyosarcoma diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical examination
and ask you about your symptoms. They’ll also review your medical history, including any past or current health conditions.
Your provider will take imaging tests to see inside your body and determine the size and location of the tumor. These imaging tests may include:
Angiography
Computed tomography (CT) scans
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
PET scan
Your provider will likely need to do a
biopsy
, too. When testing for LMS, providers try to take small samples from several parts of the cancer. Once they have the tissue samples, they’ll send them to a
pathologist
for testing.
Management and Treatment
How is leiomyosarcoma treated?
Leiomyosarcoma treatment depends on the location and size of the tumor. Options include:
Surgery
.
When surgery is possible, it’s the go-to treatment option for leiomyosarcoma. The goal is to remove the entire tumor so that the cancer doesn’t come back.
Chemotherapy
. Providers recommend chemotherapy when the tumor is large, or when cancer cells have spread to other parts of your body.
Radiation therapy
.
Providers might use radiation therapy before surgery (
neoadjuvant therapy
) to shrink the tumor, or after surgery (
adjuvant therapy
) to kill any remaining cancer cells.
Targeted therapy
. Your healthcare team may recommend targeted therapy as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with other treatments.
How long does it take to recover from leiomyosarcoma treatment?
Recovery times can vary drastically depending on several factors, including:
Advertisement
The size and location of the cancer
The type of treatment you receive
Your body’s healing capacity
It could take several weeks or months to fully recover. Even after you’re feeling better, you’ll still need regular checkups to monitor your health and reduce the risk of
cancer recurrence
(return).

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for leiomyosarcoma?
The outlook for leiomyosarcoma varies significantly depending on the
stage
, size and location of the tumor. In some cases, LMS is curable, especially when detected and treated early.
Treatment is more complicated when it’s discovered in the later stages. Advanced,
Stage 4
leiomyosarcoma can be managed with treatment, but not
cured
.
What is the survival rate of leiomyosarcoma?
Leiomyosarcoma
survival rates
depend on several factors like:
Tumor size and location
How much of the tumor your surgeon can remove
Whether the cancer has spread — and if so, how far
The following shows five-year survival rates for three different stages of LMS (localized, regional and distant):
Cancer stage
Description
Five-year survival rate
What this means
Localized
Cancer hasn’t spread beyond where it started.
63%
Sixty-three of 100 people with localized LMS will still be alive five years after their diagnosis.
Regional
Cancer has spread to surrounding tissues and possibly to nearby lymph nodes.
36%
Thirty-six out of 100 people with regional LMS will still be alive five years after their diagnosis.
Distant
Cancer has spread to distant areas of your body.
14%
Fourteen out of 100 people with distant LMS will still be alive five years after their diagnosis.

Survival rates are only estimates
. Researchers base them on the experiences of people who had LMS in the past. Survival rates can’t tell you how long you’ll live or how well you’ll respond to treatment.
To learn more about survival rates and what they mean for you, talk to your healthcare provider.

Prevention
Can leiomyosarcoma be prevented?
Currently, there’s no known way to prevent leiomyosarcoma. But you can reduce your risk by avoiding risk factors whenever possible. Known leiomyosarcoma risk factors include:
Certain
viral infections
, like human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)
Radiation exposure
Tamoxifen
(commonly used to treat breast cancer)

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you’re undergoing treatment for leiomyosarcoma, call your healthcare provider whenever you notice new or worsening symptoms. For example, if you notice any changes to your tumor — or if you develop severe pain, sudden weight changes or other symptoms — seek prompt medical care.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you have leiomyosarcoma, talking with your healthcare provider can inform, empower and help you take control of your health. Here are some questions you may want to ask:
Where’s my cancer located?
Has my cancer spread?
How advanced is my cancer?
What are my treatment options?
What are the risks and side effects of treatment?
What are the chances that my cancer will come back after treatment?
What’s my outlook?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A cancer diagnosis of any kind can turn your world upside down. When it’s a rare disease like leiomyosarcoma, it can feel especially isolating. You might feel like no one really understands what you’re going through. Joining a local or online support group can help you feel less alone and meet others who are going through similar challenges. Your healthcare team is here to help. Talk to them any time you have questions or need a listening ear.
