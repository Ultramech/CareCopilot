Jaw Cysts and Tumors
Cysts and tumors can form in and around your jaw. Most growths are benign (noncancerous). Rarely, they’re a form of jaw cancer. These abnormal growths behave differently depending on type. Some grow slowly while others grow fast, get big and damage nearby tissue or displace teeth. The most common treatment is surgery.

Overview
What are jaw cysts and tumors?
Jaw cysts and tumors are growths that can form from
bone
(including teeth) and soft tissue in your
mouth
. A jaw cyst is a sac of fluid or semi-liquid material. A jaw
tumor
is a solid mass that forms when abnormal cells clump together. Both growths are usually
benign
(noncancerous). This means that, although they may grow and impact tissue in your face and mouth, they usually don’t spread to other parts of your body.

In rare instances, jaw cysts or tumors are
malignant
(cancerous). Healthcare providers refer to them as
jaw cancer
. Without treatment, malignant jaw cysts and tumors can spread to body parts other than your jaw.
It’s essential to get any new growth in your jaw or mouth checked. Even if a tumor or cyst is benign, some types can still hurt and damage your jaw or displace
teeth
.
Types of jaw cysts and tumors
There are several types of jaw cysts and tumors. Providers classify them based on whether they’re benign or malignant. They also consider whether they start in tissue involved in tooth development (odontogenic cysts and tumors) or from other tissue (nonodontogenic cysts and tumors).
The most common types of benign jaw cysts and tumors include:
Ameloblastoma
: A slow-growing odontogenic tumor that usually forms in your lower jaw near your back teeth (molars). It’s usually benign, but some forms of ameloblastoma may become malignant over time. Even benign tumors can grow big enough to change the structure of your jaw or damage your teeth.
Central giant cell granuloma
: The most common benign non-odontogenic tumor. It usually forms in the front part of your lower jaw, but it can also develop in your upper jaw. Most tumors only cause painless swelling in your jaw. But fast-growing tumors can cause painful swelling and displace teeth.
Dentigerous cysts
: The second most common odontogenic cyst. They’re slow-growing cysts that form around the tissue of teeth that haven’t pushed into your mouth (erupted) yet. They usually form near your back teeth (molars). Sometimes, they appear near the teeth on either side of your upper front teeth (upper canines).
Odontogenic keratocysts
: Slow-growing cysts that usually form near your molars. Smaller keratocysts aren’t usually painful, but large cysts can cause painful swelling. These cysts may be a sign of an inherited condition called
Gorlin syndrome
. This condition increases your risk of odontogenic keratocysts and some forms of
skin cancer
.
Odontogenic myxoma (myxofibroma)
: A benign, slow-growing tumor. But these tumors can grow big enough to damage your jaw and displace your teeth.
Odontoma
: The most common benign odontogenic tumor. One type usually forms in your lower jaw and contains multiple tooth-like structures (compound type). The other type usually forms in your upper jaw and contains unusual masses that don’t resemble teeth (complex type).
Periapical cysts
: The most common type of jaw cyst. They form when there’s an injury to a tooth that causes
inflammation
.

Malignant jaw cysts and tumors include rare forms of:
Carcinoma
: Cancer that starts in the tissue lining your organs, internal passageways and
skin
.
Sarcoma
: Cancer that starts in bone or surrounding soft tissue.
Carcinosarcoma
: Cancer that’s a mix of both carcinoma and sarcoma.
How common are jaw cysts and tumors?
Jaw cysts and tumors are uncommon, and malignant types are especially rare.
Research shows that people in some regions may be more likely to develop them than in other areas. For example, odontogenic tumors account for just 1% of atypical oral (mouth) growths in North America but nearly 20% in some African countries.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a cyst or tumor in my jaw?
Most cysts and tumors are slow-growing and don’t cause symptoms. You may not know you have one until they show up incidentally on a
dental X-ray
or another imaging test related to a head and neck issue.
But large growths that start to take the place of nearby healthy tissue can cause symptoms, including:
Jaw pain
, tenderness or
numbness
.
Swelling (may or may not be painless).
Changes in the way your face looks.
A new lump on your jawbone (may be hard or soft).
Changing bite.
Loose teeth
.
What causes jaw cysts and tumors?
Most jaw cysts and tumors form when the cells that eventually form teeth behave abnormally and form masses (tumors) or fluid-filled sacs instead. This is what happens with odontogenic growths. But the cells don’t have to be involved in tooth formation to grow abnormally.
Odd cell growth often happens because of DNA changes (
genetic mutations
). DNA contains the instructions, or code, that tell cells how to grow, including when to stop. Problems with the code can disrupt cell division processes and cause overgrowths.
For example, people with Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome) have mutations that cause cells to continue multiplying and dividing when they shouldn’t. As a result, people with the condition often get multiple odontogenic keratocysts and are at increased risk of
basal cell carcinoma
, the most common skin cancer.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are jaw cysts and tumors diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will review your symptoms and medical history and perform a
physical exam
. Imaging tests can show tumors or cysts in and around your jaw. They include:
X-rays
.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
.
Computed tomography (CT) scan
.
You’ll also need a
biopsy
. During a biopsy, a provider removes a sample of fluid or tissue from the growth. A
pathologist
examines the sample under a microscope to determine the type of cells it contains. This information tells your provider:
What type of cyst or tumor you have.
Whether it’s benign or malignant.
Whether it’s slow-growing or aggressive.
All these factors help your provider determine the best treatment options.

Management and Treatment
How are jaw cysts and tumors treated?
Most people need surgery to remove the cyst or tumor. In addition to removing the growth, your surgeon may also remove any affected tissue. This includes damaged teeth or parts of your lower or upper jaw. Surgery to remove segments of the lower part of your jaw is called a
mandibulectomy
. Surgery that removes all or part of your upper jaw is called
maxillectomy
.
Following surgery, you may need treatments to rebuild your jaw and help with recovery, including:
Reconstructive surgery
: Your provider may remove a segment of bone from another part of your body (like your hip, shoulder blade or lower leg) to make your jaw look like it did before you had a growth.
Dental implants
: You may need artificial teeth to replace the ones that your provider pulled.
Speech therapy
: A
speech-language pathologist
(SLP) can help improve your speaking if you’re having trouble talking and being understood after surgery.
Nutrition guidance
: You may need to meet with a nutrition specialist, like a
dietitian
or nutritionist, who can advise you on what foods you can safely eat as you heal.
If you have jaw cancer, your healthcare provider may also recommend cancer treatments, including
radiation therapy
and/or
chemotherapy
. The best treatment for you depends on the type of tumor or cyst.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a jaw cyst or tumor?
Surgery can cure most jaw cysts and tumors. Depending on the type, you may need follow-up visits to monitor new growths.
For example, periapical cysts, odontomas and dentigerous cysts don’t usually grow back (recur) after surgery. But central giant cell granuloma, odontogenic myxoma and odontogenic keratocysts often do. Ameloblastoma recurs in up to 20% of people.
Living With
When should I seek care?
See your healthcare provider if you’re experiencing pain or swelling in your jaw or if you notice a change in your appearance, like a lump on your jaw or shifting teeth. It may be a sign of a cyst, tumor or a separate dental condition your provider can treat.
It’s especially important to visit your dentist regularly. A routine dental X-ray can show signs of a cyst or tumor when it’s still small and isn’t causing symptoms.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Questions to ask include:
What type of tumor or cyst do I have?
Is it benign or malignant?
Will I need surgery?
How likely is it that it will return after surgery?
How can I care for myself while I’m recovering from surgery?
Additional Common Questions
When should I be worried about a lump on my jawline?
Many conditions can cause a lump on your jawline, and most aren’t serious enough to worry about. Causes include cysts and tumors — but the issue may be as simple as an allergic reaction or a
swollen lymph node
.

It may be helpful to keep in mind that most benign growths feel soft and moveable when you touch them. If a growth is cancerous, it’s more likely to feel hard. The exception is
liposarcoma
, which is a cancer that may feel like a soft and moveable mass.
If you have a new lump that doesn’t go away, is painful and interferes with your ability to move your jaw — it’s time to see a provider.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Although most jaw cysts and tumors are benign, it can still be frustrating to learn you have a condition that’ll likely require surgery. But it’s important to remove them before they cause symptoms that can be difficult to live with, like pain or swelling in your mouth. If you’re already living with these symptoms, surgery can help get rid of them for good. Ask your provider about treatment options and likely outcomes based on the specific type of cyst or tumor you have.
