Folliculitis Decalvans
Staph A bacteria may cause folliculitis decalvans, a condition that causes baldness with scarring (cicatricial alopecia). Inflammation and bacteria in hair follicles cause pustules to form. Hair follicles eventually die, preventing new hair growth and causing circular bald patches. Treatments include antibiotics and photodynamic therapy.

What is folliculitis?
Folliculitis
is inflammation of the
hair follicle
. Follicles are the bulb-shaped root that anchors hair to your scalp and generates new hair. Bacteria trapped in the inflamed hair follicle can cause small pus-filled bumps called pustules to form. These red, oozing pustules look like
acne
.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes folliculitis decalvans?
Experts aren’t sure what causes folliculitis decalvans. A
staphylococcus infection
(staph infection) may be to blame. Some people seem to have an unusual reaction to
Staphylococcus aureus
(
Staph A
). This bacterium is naturally found on your
skin
and inside your
nose
.
Staph A
is usually harmless. But for some people, the bacteria causes ongoing inflammation. Over time, this inflammation destroys hair follicles, preventing them from growing new hair. Eventually, hair falls out, leaving
scars
. This hair loss (also known as alopecia) is permanent.
What are the risk factors for folliculitis decalvans?
Folliculitis decalvans can cause permanent
hair loss in women
and men. It more often affects
men
. It often starts during the teen years or early adulthood but can develop at any time.
What are folliculitis decalvans symptoms?
Folliculitis decalvans typically affects only your scalp, causing round or oval-shaped bald spots. Rarely, hair loss occurs in other regions. It can affect your armpits, genitals, face, legs and arms.

Some people don’t have noticeable symptoms until they begin to lose hair. Others may have an itchy scalp that feels like dandruff (
seborrheic dermatitis
).
The scalp may feel tight or painful. Pustules most commonly appear on the back of your head but can occur anywhere on your scalp. You may feel scaly skin or crusts after the pustules ooze and form scabs.
Folliculitis decalvans causes hair to grow in tufts. Several strands of hair grow from the same follicle, like bristles on a toothbrush. For this reason, the condition is also called tufted folliculitis. When the follicle dies, the tufts of hair fall out, leaving a scar and bald spot.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is folliculitis decalvans diagnosed?
A
dermatologist
, a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions, will examine your scalp. Your provider may use a magnifying device to view the pustules more clearly.
Your provider may also:
Take a swab of the pustule fluid to check for the presence of
Staph A
.
Pluck a few strands of hair and take skin scrapings from the scalp to test for
ringworm
. This fungal infection causes similar symptoms.
Perform a
skin biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis.
Management and Treatment
Can folliculitis decalvans be cured?
There isn’t a cure for folliculitis decalvans. But treatments can reduce inflammation and prevent scarring and further hair loss. The condition sometimes goes into remission (no symptoms) but can return and cause a flare (active symptoms). Treatment is often an ongoing process.
Folliculitis decalvans treatments include oral:
Antibiotics
to kill
Staph A
bacteria. Staph bacteria can develop antibiotic resistance, which makes the drugs ineffective.
MRSA
is a type of staph bacterium that doesn’t respond to most antibiotics, including methicillin.
Corticosteroids
to ease inflammation.
Isotretinoin
(Accutane®) to clear up the pustules.
Some studies suggest that methyl aminolevulinate
photodynamic therapy
(MAL-PDT) helps. This treatment uses a chemical applied to the scalp. The chemical reacts to a special light to kill bacteria and cells.
How can you manage folliculitis decalvans?
Your provider may recommend an antiseptic shampoo or a shampoo containing tar to kill bacteria on your scalp.
