Inhalant use shares characteristics with other substance use disorders because it intensely and directly stimulates the reinforcement and reward systems of your
brain
. This compulsive use of the drug can lead to dependence. When you’re dependent on a drug, everything else in your life can fall by the wayside. This can lead to negative consequences and long-term health effects.
What is the prevalence of inhalant use disorder?
According to a 2020 survey, 2.4 million people in the U.S. ages 12 and older had used an inhalant in the past year.

What are the risk factors for inhalant use disorder?
Children and teenagers ages 12 to 17 are the most common age group that uses inhalants. In 2020, they made up the largest percentage of inhalant users at 2.7%. But studies show children as young as 5 have used inhalants. Children and teens often use inhalants because they’re inexpensive and easy to find. They often use these drugs before moving on to other substances, like cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs.
Inhalant use disorder is also more common in
men
than in women.
What are the complications of inhalant use disorder?
Long-term inhalant use can lead to a variety of physical and psychological complications. These may happen directly from drug use or because using substances is associated with other risks like unsafe sex or unstable housing. Physical health conditions can include:
Tuberculosis
.
HIV/AIDS
.
Sexually transmitted infections
.
Bronchitis
.
Asthma
.
Sinusitis
.
Psychological conditions can include:
Depression.
Anxiety
.
Inhalant-induced psychotic disorder.
Major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
Inhalant intoxication
delirium
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is inhalant use disorder diagnosed?
According to the
DSM-5
, healthcare providers can diagnose inhalant use disorder when the repeated use of inhalants leads to significant distress or impairment, or when a problematic pattern of being intoxicated develops.
Providers can diagnose the condition when at least two of the following symptoms occur over a one-year period:
A strong craving or desire to use inhalants.
A strong urge to stop using inhalants and/or unsuccessful efforts to do so.
Spending a lot of time getting, using or recovering from the effects of inhalants.
Continuing to use inhalants despite problems they can lead to, including issues with work, school and relationships.
Giving up important career, social or recreational activities because of inhalant use.
Using inhalants repeatedly despite knowing their physical effects.
Needing more of a particular inhalant to get the same effect you were able to reach before.
Management and Treatment
How is inhalant use disorder treated?
Inhalant use disorder treatment methods are similar to those healthcare providers use to treat other addictive behaviors. These treatments include individual therapy (
cognitive behavioral therapy
), family therapy, activity and engagement programs and aftercare (including support groups).
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT):
CBT includes teaching how to handle stressful situations, coping with cravings and resisting offers to use inhalants.
Motivational interventions:
This counseling style helps teens gain the motivation to commit to change.
Family counseling:
This therapy focuses on improving communication, relationships, actions and behaviors between family members.
Activity and engagement programs:
These programs provide new skills and social experiences and offer an alternative to inhalant use. Programs include activities such as movie nights, dances, hiking and more. These types of programs play an important role in maintaining a substance-free life by helping teens engage in new social relationships with others who are non-users.
Support groups and 12-step programs:
These groups, like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, help reduce the risk of relapse and help maintain a substance-free life.

People who have a more severe inhalant use disorder may receive the best treatment at a residential treatment program.
Can a person overdose on inhalants?
Yes. Some products, especially solvents and aerosol sprays, have high concentrations of harmful chemicals. Sniffing these products can lead to
seizures
,
coma
and
sudden cardiac death
(heart stops beating) — even for first-time users. Breathing in inhalants from a paper or plastic bag placed over your head can cause death from suffocation. Replacement of oxygen in the lungs with toxic fumes from inhalants can cause death by
asphyxiation
.
How is an inhalant overdose treated?
Emergency treatment of an inhalant overdose involves treating the life-threatening event that occurs as the result of the overdose — like stopping the seizure or restarting the heart. There aren’t any specific treatments available to reverse the effects of inhalant intoxication.

Prevention
Can inhalant use disorder be prevented?
Studies have shown that teaching adolescents life skills training in school has helped reduce inhalant use. Life skills training focuses on:
Increasing self-esteem and communication.
Improving personal relationships.
Managing anxiety and pressure.
Other school-based programs that target adolescent substance use have produced positive results.
Living With
How can I help a loved one with inhalant use disorder?
It can be very stressful and challenging to learn someone you love has inhalant use disorder. To help care for your loved one:
Speak up:
Say something sooner rather than later. The earlier a person with inhalant use disorder receives treatment, the better. Talk to them about your concerns and help your loved one find treatment as soon as possible.
Practice empathy:
Even if you don’t agree with your loved one, listen to them thoughtfully. The more they feel heard, the more they’ll open up to you and see you as someone they can trust.
Be patient:
Don’t think that one action or conversation will fix your loved one’s problem. Inhalant use disorder is a complex substance use disorder, and there’s no quick fix.
Take care of yourself:
You may be experiencing depression,
stress
, isolation or grief as you try to help. That’s OK. But it’s important to take care of your mental health, too. And the stronger you are, the more support you can offer your loved one. Seek help if you need it.
