What’s the difference between psoriasis and eczema on the hands and feet?
Psoriasis on your hands and feet can look similar to another skin condition called eczema.
Eczema
causes a dry, discolored and itchy rash on your skin. Psoriasis causes scales and flakes on a patch of discolored skin.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of psoriasis on the hands and feet?
Symptoms of psoriasis on the hands and feet include a patch of skin with:
Scales or flakes.
Skin discoloration.
Itchy skin
.
Dry skin
.
Certain types of psoriasis, like palmoplantar pustulosis, can cause fluid- or pus-filled
blisters
or pustules that can turn yellow to brown and then become scaly.
What causes psoriasis on the hands and feet?
An overactive immune system causes psoriasis. Your immune system fights off foreign invaders like bacteria to keep your body healthy. If you have psoriasis, your immune system mistakes healthy skin cells for foreign invaders. As a result, it makes your cells divide and replicate too quickly. This causes dead skin cells to move to the surface of your skin, causing symptoms of flaky, scaly skin.
The reason why psoriasis localizes to your hands and feet, or any other part of your body, is unknown.
Is psoriasis on the hands and feet contagious?
No, psoriasis isn’t contagious. You can’t spread the skin condition to other people by physical contact.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is psoriasis on the hands and feet diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose psoriasis on your hands and feet after a physical exam. During the exam, they’ll go over your medical history, including asking questions about your allergies, skin irritants or if you have a biological family history of skin conditions like psoriasis.
Psoriasis can look similar to other skin conditions like eczema, so your provider might offer a test to rule out other conditions or to confirm a diagnosis. Common tests could include a
skin biopsy
or an
allergy test
.
You may need to visit a
dermatologist
to receive a psoriasis diagnosis.
Management and Treatment
How is psoriasis on the hands and feet treated?

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have psoriasis on the hands and feet?
Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition. This means it can come and go throughout your life and there isn’t a cure. Treatment is available to help you manage your symptoms when they do flare up.
Flare-ups can happen if you come into contact with irritants and allergens in your environment. These are called triggers. Triggers activate your immune system, which causes it to overreact. Common triggers could include
stress
or
sun exposure
. Work with your healthcare provider to identify triggers in your environment that cause your symptoms to flare up. Avoiding these triggers can reduce the amount of symptoms you experience.
Prevention
How can I prevent psoriasis on the hands and feet?
There’s no known way to prevent psoriasis, but you can reduce your risk of developing a flare-up of psoriasis symptoms on your hands and feet by:
Washing the skin of your hands and feet often, with a gentle soap and water.
Using moisturizers regularly on your skin.
Identifying triggers that cause your psoriasis symptoms to flare up and avoid those triggers.
Wearing sunscreen when you go outdoors.
