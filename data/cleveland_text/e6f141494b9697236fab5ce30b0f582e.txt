Your
central nervous system
includes your
brain
and
spinal cord
. Your
peripheral nervous system
includes all the
nerves
that branch off of your spinal cord. It further breaks down into your:
Somatic nervous system
: This guides your voluntary movements.
Autonomic nervous system
: This regulates the activities you do without thinking about them (involuntary movements).
Your nervous system regulates everything you do. It helps you breathe, swallow, sleep and move. It allows your heart to beat and your body to age. It assists with processes like digestion. It also coordinates your senses and helps you speak, learn and remember. These are only a few of the many things that your nervous system does.
Neurological disorders cause physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral symptoms like pain, confusion, mood changes and/or coordination difficulties. Treatment options are available to help you manage symptoms.

and testing. During the exam, your provider will assess how your nervous system functions.
Additional testing may be necessary to pinpoint the cause of your symptoms so your provider can make an accurate diagnosis and offer treatment specific to your needs. These tests could include:
Blood tests
.
EEG (
electroencephalogram
).
EMG (
electromyography
).
Imaging tests (
MRI
or
CT scan
).
Nerve conduction study
.
Spinal tap (
lumbar puncture

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for neurological disorders?
A healthcare provider will give you the most up-to-date and accurate information on your outlook specific to your situation. Some neurological disorders have a minimal impact on your routine. Others require around-the-clock care.
Your care team will help you understand what neurological disorder affects you or your loved one and offer advice on what treatment options and next steps are available. If you have any questions, let your provider know.
Living with a neurological condition can be stressful. Sometimes, symptoms are unpredictable, and it can stop you from participating in the things you enjoy with the people you care about. This can have a significant impact on your mental health. Many people find comfort in speaking with a mental health professional to find ways to better manage their emotional well-being in addition to physical symptoms.
Prevention
Can neurological disorders be prevented?
There isn’t a way to prevent all neurological disorders. You can reduce your risk of injury or damage to your nervous system by taking care of your general health and protecting yourself during activities that pose a risk, like wearing a helmet when playing contact sports, for example.
Living With
When should I see a healthcare provider?
Since neurological disorders can affect anyone at any age and the symptoms vary from person to person, reach out to a healthcare provider if something doesn’t feel right.

Many parents reach out to a healthcare provider if their child
misses developmental milestones
. You might see a provider following an illness or an injury. You might contact a provider if a loved one isn’t behaving like themselves.
Neurological disorders affect each person differently and it’s difficult to predict if, how or when it’ll affect you. Let a provider know right away if you or a loved one experience symptoms of a neurological disorder.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Receiving a neurological disorder diagnosis can be intimidating. Your nervous system regulates all your bodily functions, including your thoughts, memories, feelings and sensations. Each neurological disorder has its own path — it may have a minimal effect on your life or require 24/7 management to ease symptoms and prevent complications.
No matter what situation you face, you don’t have to face it alone. Your care team is available to help you understand how a neurological condition affects your body and what you can do to stay in good health.
