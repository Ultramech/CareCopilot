Prosthesis
A prosthesis is an artificial body part that replaces a part that’s missing or no longer functional. You might use a prosthesis if you’ve lost a body part to injury or disease, or you were born without one. A prosthesis can be an external part that you wear during the day and remove at night — like a prosthetic limb. It can also be an internal implant or device.

Overview
A prosthesis replaces a missing or dysfunctional body part to help you perform ordinary tasks.
What is a prosthesis?
A prosthesis is an artificial replacement part for your body. It replaces a part that’s missing or no longer working as you need it to. That’s the broadest definition of a prosthesis: It includes external body parts, like limbs, as well as internal parts and devices, like a mechanical heart valve or joint replacement.

What does it mean to wear a prosthesis?
Many people who use the term “prosthesis” are referring to an artificial part that they wear during the day and remove at night. If you wear a prosthesis, it affects your everyday lifestyle. You’ve had to learn how to put it on and remove it, how to function with it and how to clean and care for it as a body part.
What’s the difference between a prosthesis and prosthetics?
The medical specialty that deals with prostheses is called prosthetics. “Prosthetic” is also an adjective to describe a prosthesis, as in, “a prosthetic limb,” “a prosthetic implant” or “a prosthetic device.” “Prosthetics” sometimes substitutes for “prostheses” as a plural noun, meaning “prosthetic parts.”
What are some examples of prostheses (prosthetics)?
Many people think of a prosthesis as an external, removable body part, such as:
A prosthetic limb or appendage, like an
arm
,
leg
,
hand
,
foot
, finger or toe.
An
ocular prosthesis (prosthetic eye or glass eye)
.
Breast or nipple prostheses that you wear in your bra.
A penile prosthesis that you attach with a strap.
Colostomy bags
and
ileal pouches
that replace a part of your intestine.
Dentures
(false teeth).
But prostheses also include internal replacement parts and devices, such as:
Bone and
joint replacements
, like an
artificial cervical disk
or
hip replacement
.
Mechanical heart valve replacement
or a
total artificial heart
.
Electronic voice box (
larynx
) after removal (
laryngectomy)
.
Breast implants
,
testicular implants
and
penile implants
.
Dental bridges
that replace missing teeth.
Intraocular lenses (IOL)
that replace your eye lens.

Who can prosthetics help?
You might benefit from a prosthesis if you were born without a body part or lost it to an injury or disease. Sometimes, an internal body part stops functioning well, and a prosthesis can replace it as well as, or better than, a transplant. Some reasons why you might need or want a prosthesis include:
Traumatic injury requiring
reconstructive surgery
.
Cancer
(or cancer risk) requiring removal of a body part.
Limb loss (
amputation
) due to injury or disease.
Congenital (present at birth) defects
.
Long-term wear and tear on a body part, like
arthritis
or
cataracts
.
Chronic disease in a body part, like
heart valve disease
or
inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD).
Risks / Benefits
What benefits can a prosthesis provide?
Some prostheses are mainly cosmetic. They replace noticeably missing parts so you look more like those around you. Other prostheses have mechanical functions that can replace the functions of your missing or malfunctioning part. They can bring more ease and self-sufficiency to your everyday life.
A prosthesis can help you:
Talk.
See.
Chew.
Bend at a joint.
Walk, run or perform in sports.
Grasp, hold or manipulate objects.
Operate household appliances, a computer or a car.
Look more like those around you and have more social confidence.
What are the potential risks or downsides of a prosthesis?
Adapting to a prosthesis is no small matter — it takes time and effort, not to mention the cost. And since most prosthetics have a limited lifespan, you may have to go through this process more than once. Some people might have less to gain from all this than others, depending on their conditions and goals.
Potential risks or downsides to getting a prosthesis might include:
General risks of surgery and recovery for an internal prosthesis.
Extensive rehabilitation period, which may include physical and occupational therapy.
Lifelong maintenance, including refittings and adjustments for parts that grow.
Limited lifespan of the prosthesis, which will eventually need replacing.
Implant complications like loosening or moving out of place.
External prosthesis complications like skin sores and comfort issues.
The need to take certain medications while living with certain internal prostheses.
Limited health or mobility outlook, despite the prosthesis.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you’re considering a prosthesis, you’ll have a lot to think about, and you may not have a lot of time to do so. This can feel overwhelming, especially when the stakes feel very high. Some types of prostheses have many options to choose from. You might also have alternative treatment options to consider.

At this moment, it helps to remember that there’s a community of caregivers and others living with prosthetics who know this landscape well. Spend a little time browsing online and discussing important details with your inner circle. As these details become clearer, so will your own priorities and needs.
