Weber Syndrome
Weber syndrome can develop when you have damage in your midbrain — usually from a stroke. It causes paralysis on one side of your body and eye movement issues. Rehabilitation can help improve your symptoms. Early treatment and rehabilitation are key to a better prognosis.

Overview
What is Weber syndrome?
Weber syndrome happens when damage to your midbrain causes
paralysis
on one side of your body (
hemiplegia
). At the same time, it causes
eye
and eyelid movement issues affecting the opposite eye. Weber syndrome is rare.

Stroke
is often the underlying cause of Weber syndrome, but other conditions can also damage your midbrain.
The midbrain is the topmost part of your
brainstem
— the connection between your
brain
and
spinal cord
. Two of your 12
cranial nerves
stem from your midbrain — the
oculomotor
and
trochlear
nerves. They’re responsible for eye and eyelid movement. This is why the syndrome causes eye movement issues.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Weber syndrome?
The symptoms — or features — of Weber syndrome include:
Drooping eyelid (ptosis)
of one eye.
The affected eye points downward and outward.
Double vision (diplopia)
.
Partial or complete weakness (paralysis) of your arm and leg on one side of your body.
Get immediate medical help if you have these symptoms or other symptoms of stroke, like
slurred speech
, loss of sensation, loss of vision,
balance issues
and facial droopiness.
Some people with Weber syndrome also have coordination issues (
ataxia
).
Weber syndrome alone typically doesn’t affect your mental functions (thinking). But you may have other symptoms if the damage affects other parts of your brain. For example, Weber syndrome often happens alongside a
pontine stroke
(a stroke in your
pons
). This has additional symptoms.

What causes Weber syndrome?
Damage (a
lesion
) in a specific portion (ventromedial) of your midbrain leads to Weber syndrome. This type of damage most often results from a
stroke
. But it can also develop from:
Brain aneurysm
.
Brain bleed (hemorrhage)
.
Brain tumor
.
Demyelinating diseases
(like
multiple sclerosis
).
What are the risk factors for Weber syndrome?
Stroke is the most common cause of Weber syndrome. So, risk factors for Weber syndrome are the same as risk factors for stroke. They include:
High blood pressure (hypertension)
.
High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia)
.
Diabetes
.
Smoking
.
If you have stroke risk factors, it’s important to see your healthcare provider regularly to make sure you’re getting proper treatment for them.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Weber syndrome diagnosed?
Stroke is often the underlying cause of Weber syndrome. So, your healthcare provider’s priorities will be diagnosing stroke and getting you immediate treatment. They’ll do a
neurological exam
and order a
CT scan
of your brain. They may also recommend a scan to evaluate the blood vessels of your head and neck and a
brain MRI
.
Your provider will diagnose Weber syndrome if you have its characteristic symptoms and evidence of midbrain damage in imaging tests.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for Weber syndrome?
The initial treatment for Weber syndrome is addressing the underlying cause (usually a stroke). Your healthcare team will work quickly to manage your breathing (airway) and restore blood flow (circulation) in your brain. You may need
brain surgery
(neurosurgery).
Treatment for Weber syndrome specifically mainly involves rehabilitation strategies.
Rehabilitation for Weber syndrome
Rehabilitation is a major part of recovery for most people who’ve had a stroke. It helps you recover or adapt to the changes in your brain. You may work with a dedicated stroke rehabilitation team and/or a
physical therapist
. They’ll want to start your rehabilitation as soon as possible.
Rehabilitation for Weber syndrome and midbrain strokes may include:
Range-of-motion exercises for paralyzed limbs.
Exercises to help balance
and coordination issues.
Visual testing and exercises to improve double vision.
Bladder training
if you have
urinary incontinence
.
Medication or other interventions to manage existing stroke risk factors and help prevent another stroke.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for someone with Weber syndrome?
The prognosis (outlook) for someone with Weber syndrome depends on several factors, including:
What caused it.
How soon you receive treatment.
If you just have Weber syndrome or have damage in other parts of your brain.
How well you can prevent future strokes.
People who just have Weber syndrome without other forms of brain damage usually have a better prognosis. Starting rehabilitation early is also key to a better prognosis.
With rehabilitation, some people regain movement in their affected limbs and eye. Others may have permanent movement issues and other neurological complications.

Your healthcare team will be able to give you a better idea of what to expect based on your unique situation.
What are the possible complications of Weber syndrome?
You’re more likely to have complications from Weber syndrome specifically if you can’t leave your bed. This is why your healthcare team will encourage movement as soon as it’s safe. Complications could include:
Muscle rigidity and contractures (muscle tightening).
Bedsores
.
Aspiration pneumonia
.
Deep vein thrombosis.
Pulmonary embolism.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A stroke can upend your life in an instant. Because of this, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with its symptoms and go to the hospital as soon as possible if you or a loved one develops them. Weber syndrome is rare, and it may be overwhelming. But know that your healthcare team will be by your side to support you throughout your recovery.
