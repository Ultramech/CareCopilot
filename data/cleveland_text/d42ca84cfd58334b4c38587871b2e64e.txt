The
pupil
is the black center of your
eye
that changes size to help you see in different amounts of light. It shrinks (contracts) in bright light and expands (dilates) in dim light.
Your pupils automatically adjust throughout the day without you noticing or controlling them. If you have anisocoria, one will be stuck noticeably larger than the other. You’ll probably be able to see the size difference in a mirror or selfie.
This might affect your
vision
. If one pupil can’t adjust to light like it should, you might have trouble seeing clearly, or be sensitive to light in your affected eye.
Visit an
eye care specialist
or go to the emergency room if you notice one of your pupils is suddenly larger than the other. Some people develop anisocoria with no long-term complications, but it can also be a sign of a life-threatening medical emergency. If you have other symptoms, like pain or noticeably worse vision, go to your nearest emergency room.
Types of anisocoria
Eye care specialists classify anisocoria as either physiological (caused by something malfunctioning inside your body) or pathological (caused by a health condition). Physiological anisocoria is more common.
This distinction isn’t as important as getting your symptoms evaluated right away. No matter what’s causing your pupils to be irregularly sized, you should see an eye care specialist as soon as possible.

How common is anisocoria?
Experts estimate that around 15% of people experience anisocoria at some point in their lives.
Some babies are born with it (congenital anisocoria), but it usually happens because of a health condition or another issue that affects your eyes.
Symptoms and Causes
What are anisocoria symptoms?
One pupil being noticeably bigger (more
dilated
) than the other is the most obvious anisocoria symptom.
You might not experience other symptoms. If that’s the case, you still need to visit an eye care specialist to have the change in your eyes diagnosed.
Go to the emergency room if one pupil is bigger than the other and you experience any of the following:
Eye pain
.
Blurry vision
.
Double vision (diplopia)
.
Light sensitivity (photophobia)
.
Sudden vision loss
.
Other symptoms can include:
Fever
.
Headaches
.
Nausea
or
vomiting
.
Neck pain
or stiffness.
What is the most common cause of anisocoria?
Anisocoria can be caused by lots of health conditions and injuries, and can be a side effect of some medications. It can also happen without a known cause (idiopathic anisocoria).
Some of the most common causes include:
Migraine headaches
.
Surgery side effects.
Eye drops,
scopolamine skin patches
and some other medicines.
Eye injuries
and traumas that affect your head, eyes or the
arteries
that supply blood to them.
Some serious, potentially fatal health conditions can cause anisocoria, including:
Brain aneurysms
.
Strokes
.
Brain tumors
.
Infections like
meningitis
.
Certain types of
cancer
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is anisocoria diagnosed?
An eye care specialist or another healthcare provider will diagnose anisocoria with an
eye exam
. They’ll perform a
physical exam
to check for other symptoms. They might give you eye drops to make it easier to examine your eyes.
Your provider may use imaging tests to look for what’s causing anisocoria, including:
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging).
CT scan
(computed tomography scan).
X-ray
.
You might also need
blood tests
or a
lumbar puncture
if your provider thinks you have an infection.
Management and Treatment
How do you fix anisocoria?
Finding and treating what’s causing the anisocoria is more important than managing the irregularity in your pupils.
If you have no other symptoms — and your eye care specialist rules out any serious underlying conditions — you probably won’t need any treatment. Your pupils may return to their usual size over time.
If anisocoria is the first sign of a more serious condition, the treatment you’ll need depends on what’s causing it. Talk to your provider about what you’ll need to do next and what to expect.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have anisocoria?
Everyone’s outlook is different. It depends on what’s causing the anisocoria. Some issues like migraines or reactions to medications will go away on their own. If you experience something more serious like an aneurysm or stroke, your life might be changed permanently.

For most people, anisocoria is a minor part of a larger health issue, and as you treat your underlying condition, your pupils will return to their usual size.
Ask your healthcare provider or eye care specialist about your unique outlook.
Prevention
How can I prevent anisocoria?
Because lots of conditions and injuries can cause anisocoria, there’s not one surefire way to prevent it.
Have your eyes examined regularly, and see a healthcare provider every year for a checkup. Regular eye exams and maintaining your overall health are the best ways to catch issues that might cause anisocoria before they damage your eyes and body.

Additional Common Questions
Which kind of doctor treats anisocoria?

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Anisocoria is the medical name for your pupils being of different sizes. It’s usually a temporary issue, but it can be a sign that something inside your body is seriously wrong. Go to the ER if you notice anisocoria and have eye pain, vision loss or other symptoms that make you think something’s not quite right.
Even if it turns out that you’re having a short-term reaction, you should always take any changes in your eyes seriously and have them checked out by a provider right away. They’ll help you understand what’s causing the anisocoria and which treatments are best for you.
