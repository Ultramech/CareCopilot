Diagnosis and Tests
How is a vestibular migraine diagnosed?
Healthcare providers first ask questions about your symptoms, including how long you’ve been dealing with dizziness and balance issues. They do that because conditions like
Ménière’s disease
and
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
also cause dizziness or a spinning sensation. Providers will rule out other potential causes before focusing on vestibular migraine as a diagnosis.
In general, you may receive a vestibular migraine diagnosis if you have:
Sudden attacks of vertigo that make you vomit or feel nauseous.
At least five episodes of vertigo, with half of those causing other migraine symptoms, like headache or increased sensitivity to light, sound or touch.
Vertigo that lasts for five minutes up to 72 hours.
Vertigo that’s so severe that it affects your ability to work or manage everyday activities.

If your provider suspects you have a vestibular migraine, they may do the following tests:
Neurological examination
.
Videonstagmography
or
electronystagmography
.
Imaging tests like
computed tomography (CT) scans
or
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans.
Hearing loss test
.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for vestibular migraines?
Healthcare providers may recommend medications, lifestyle changes or
vestibular rehabilitation therapy
.
Medications
Healthcare providers may recommend daily or weekly medications that reduce the chance you’ll have a vestibular migraine. Or they may recommend medication that eases migraine symptoms when you have one.
Medications that may prevent vestibular migraine include:
Tricyclic antidepressants
.
Calcium channel blockers
.
Antiseizure medications
.
Beta-blockers
.
Medications to reduce symptoms include:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
.
Motion-sickness medications.
Antipsychotic medication
.
Lifestyle changes
Your provider may recommend that you:

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to a healthcare provider if you have several dizzy spells or balance issues that affect your daily life, particularly if you have migraines.

headaches

What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Vestibular migraines aren’t common. You may want to ask the following questions:
Why do I have this condition?
Will my symptoms get worse?
What treatments do you recommend?
Will I always need medication?
Apart from watching what I eat and getting enough rest, are there other ways I can manage vestibular migraine symptoms?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you have migraines, you’re probably familiar with its symptoms: seeing streaks of light just before you’re hit with a painful, throbbing headache. You may have blamed your migraines for bouts of dizziness and feeling like you’ve lost your sense of balance. But regular severe dizzy spells (with or without throbbing headache) may be a sign that you have vestibular migraines.
Fortunately, healthcare providers have treatments that can keep the condition from happening or ease its symptoms. And there are steps you can take, like getting more sleep, avoiding certain foods and drinks, and reducing stress. If you have migraines and frequent dizzy spells, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll do tests to confirm vestibular migraines. More importantly, they’ll provide information, medication and other treatments that may prevent or ease vestibular migraine attacks.
