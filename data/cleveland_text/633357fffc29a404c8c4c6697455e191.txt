Symptoms and Causes
Alcohol use disorder may take over your life. You may drink despite the damage it does to your relationships or plan your life around your next drink. It also causes physical issues like craving alcohol or having alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
What are the symptoms of alcohol use disorder?
When you think about medical condition symptoms, you may focus on physical issues like pain, fever or a cough that won’t go away. Alcohol use disorder symptoms focus on changes in your mood and behavior, including:
Craving beverages containing alcohol.
Continuing to use these beverages even though your drinking affects your relationships with your family, friends and colleagues.
Drinking more than you intended, or for longer than you intended.
Spending lots of time obtaining and drinking these beverages or recovering from
hangovers
caused by drinking.
Repeatedly trying to reduce how much you drink.
Repeatedly failing to meet work or family obligations because you’re drinking.
Giving up important social, work or recreational activities because of alcohol.
Using alcohol in physically hazardous situations.
Continuing to drink when you have a medical condition or mental disorder that gets worse when you drink.
Having a high tolerance for beverages containing alcohol.
Having alcohol withdrawal symptoms or drinking to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
How much is too much?
The American Medical Association recommends a two-drink daily limit for
men
. Heavy drinking in this population is five or more drinks in one day or 15 or more drinks in a week. Women should limit drinking to one drink a day. Heavy drinking in this population is four or more drinks a day or eight drinks a week.

What causes alcohol use disorder?
Researchers don’t know all the reasons why someone develops it, but have identified the following factors:
Genetics
: Studies show people with a family history of alcohol use disorder have an increased risk of developing it.
Mental health conditions
: Having conditions like
depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) or
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) may increase your risk of alcohol use disorder.
What are the complications of this condition?
Hangovers and withdrawal are two issues that affect people with alcohol use disorder. But alcohol is a chemical
carcinogen
. Heavy, long-term consumption of beverages containing alcohol increases your risk of developing esophageal cancer. Other potential complications are:
Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy
.
Alcohol-induced hepatitis
.
Alcohol poisoning
.
Cerebellar degeneration
.
Cirrhosis of the liver.
Delirium tremens
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is alcohol use disorder diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose the condition by doing a physical examination to look for symptoms of conditions that alcohol use disorder may cause.
They’ll use criteria laid out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (
DSM-5
), based on the symptoms listed previously. Your provider will determine if you have alcohol use disorder and if your condition is mild, moderate or severe:
Mild:
Your symptoms match two to three criteria.
Moderate:
Symptoms match four to five criteria.
Severe:
Symptoms match six or more criteria.
Management and Treatment
What are treatments for alcohol use disorder?
Your treatment depends on your situation. If your condition is severe, your healthcare provider may recommend inpatient medical treatment or residential rehabilitation. Other treatments are:
Behavioral treatment
: This treatment focuses on counseling that changes your drinking behavior. You may work with
addiction counselors
or
psychologists
.
Medication:
The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has approved
naltrexone
and acamprosate as alcohol use disorder treatment. Topiramate and gabapentin can also decrease cravings in some people.
Support groups
: Support groups are a way to connect with others who understand your situation.

How do I take care of myself?
If you’re receiving care for alcohol use disorder, you’ve already taken an important step toward taking care of yourself. Recovery is a journey that you take one step at a time, one day at a time. Here are some suggestions that may help you along the way:
Get some exercise
: Exercise is a great way to manage stress, whether it’s day-to-day challenges or feeling stressed about not drinking alcohol.
Know your triggers:
With alcohol use disorder, certain circumstances may trigger the urge to have a drink.
Seek support:
Whether it’s a 12-step program or time with a therapist, it may help to talk with people who understand your situation.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
That depends on your situation. For example, if you’re receiving treatment for a condition related to alcohol use, like cirrhosis of the liver, you should ask your healthcare provider about changes in your body that may be new symptoms. If you’re receiving counseling, ask your provider about handling high-stress situations when you may feel like you need some additional mental health support.

You’ll have many questions as you go through treatment and recovery. Here are some suggestions:

If so, is it serious?
