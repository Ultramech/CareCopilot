strep throat
or scarlet fever.
Family history of
autoimmune diseases
or
rheumatic fever
.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms and signs of PANDAS syndrome?
Symptoms and signs of PANDAS have been reported to vary widely from child to child and can involve a combination of psychological and neurological conditions. The symptoms are thought to start suddenly and occur in episodes. They seem to last for a few days or weeks, then go away and return.

Anxiety
or
depression
.
Bedwetting
.
Changes in mood or personality, especially sudden rage or irritability.

Neurological symptoms that have been reported to be associated with PANDAS include:
Changes in motor skills (muscle movements), such as problems with handwriting.
Difficulty concentrating or learning.
Poor performance in school.
Reduced coordination.
Sensitivity to light and sound.
What causes PANDAS syndrome?
Some believe that PANDAS occurs when your child’s immune system produces antibodies to fight the bacteria that caused a strep infection. But the antibodies may also mistakenly attack healthy cells in other tissues because the cells mimic those of the strep infection. Some believe that antibodies affect tissues in your child’s brain, leading to the psychological and neurological symptoms sometimes reported.
Are PANS and PANDAS syndrome the same thing?
PANS stands for “pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome.” Some providers think PANDAS is a type of PANS. Both are thought by those individuals to cause similar symptoms that come on suddenly. But PANDAS is thought to be related to a strep infection, whereas PANS is thought to result from other infections such as
Lyme disease
or
influenza
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is PANDAS syndrome diagnosed?
There isn’t a test to diagnose PANDAS. A healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and evaluate your child’s symptoms.
Management and Treatment
How is PANDAS syndrome treated?
Treatment for PANDAS may include:
Antibiotics
: Children with an active strep infection, including symptoms characteristic of the infection (such as fever, sore throat, pain with swallowing), need
antibiotics
.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
:
CBT
is a form of psychotherapy. It can help your child better manage mental and emotional difficulties.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for a child with PANDAS syndrome?
Focusing on cognitive behavioral therapy for behavioral problems and
habit reversal training
for tics helps decrease the frequency of symptoms and provides children with the coping skills they need to succeed.
Prevention
How can I prevent PANDAS syndrome?
The best way to prevent any illness thought to be associated with an infection is to prevent the infection from occurring in the first place. Encourage your child to practice good hygiene by:
Covering their nose and mouth with a tissue or their elbow when they cough or sneeze.
Not sharing food, drinks or personal items, such as toothbrushes.
Washing their hands frequently and using hand sanitizer whenever possible.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
