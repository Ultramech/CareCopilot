PHACE Syndrome
PHACE syndrome can affect your child’s brain, heart, arteries and eyes. A hallmark sign of PHACE syndrome is the presence of hemangiomas, which are noncancerous (benign) skin growths made up of blood vessels, usually on your child’s face and neck. This condition can be life-threatening if symptoms are severe. Treatment helps manage the condition.

Overview
What is PHACE syndrome?
PHACE syndrome is a rare condition that can affect multiple parts of your child’s body, including their skin, brain, heart, major arteries and eyes. It’s a congenital condition, meaning your child is born with it.

It’s very rare for a child to develop abnormalities in every category. Most children show some — but not all — of the signs listed below. The most common types of abnormalities in children with PHACE syndrome include hemangiomas, cerebrovascular defects (which affect blood flow in the brain) and heart defects. These abnormalities may be apparent during your pregnancy, your child’s birth or infancy.
PHACE is an acronym. It describes specific developmental abnormalities associated with this syndrome:
What it stands for
Description
P
Posterior fossa
A small space in the back of your baby’s brain responsible for things like balance, coordination and breathing. Children with PHACE syndrome have congenital brain malformations affecting this area.
H
Hemangioma
A noncancerous growth made of blood vessels that usually appears as a discolored birthmark on your child’s face, neck or scalp.
A
Arterial abnormalities
Congenital defects that affect your child’s arteries, usually in their head or neck. This can reduce blood flow to your child’s brain or to the rest of their body.
C
Cardiac abnormalities
Heart and vascular abnormalities like a narrowed aorta, which can cause high blood pressure and blood flow issues.
E
Eye abnormalities
Eye abnormalities that may lead to poor vision or vision loss.
S*
Sternal clefting
Breastbone malformations, which can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain and other chest wall conditions.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of PHACE syndrome?
PHACE syndrome symptoms vary for each person and can range in severity. Your child’s symptoms may include:
Hemangiomas
. These are discolored growths made of extra
blood vessels
. Most hemangiomas only affect the skin (often on the scalp, trunk, arms or hands) but some can target your baby’s internal organs and cause
vision
or
hearing loss
.
Brain
abnormalities
. Your baby’s posterior fossa controls balance, coordination and vital functions like breathing. Abnormalities in this area can lead to complications like involuntary movements and
intellectual disabilities
.
Heart
abnormalities
. Certain heart abnormalities can cause difficulty breathing,
muscle weakness
, high blood pressure, irritability and sweating. Your baby may have a hole in their heart (
ventricular septal defect
) if it didn’t develop completely.
Arterial
abnormalities
. Narrowed arteries can prevent blood flow to your child’s brain. This can cause an
aneurysm
,
seizures
, a
stroke
or the loss of feeling in one side of your baby’s body.
Eye
abnormalities
. Parts of your child’s eye may not develop as expected. This could cause poor vision or
vision loss
, abnormally small eyes, uncontrollable eye movements or drooping eyes.
Breastbone
abnormalities
. Your child may have a missing or underdeveloped breastbone (sternum). They may have grooves, indentations, pits or bumps where their sternum didn’t form as expected.

Complications of PHACE syndrome
People with PHACE syndrome have a higher risk of certain conditions due to structural and blood vessel abnormalities. These complications may include:
Balance issues
Dental conditions, like
enamel hypoplasia
and tooth root abnormalities
Difficulty swallowing
Endocrine system
abnormalities, like a lack of hormone production
Migraines
Poor growth
Speech and language
delays
Stroke
Underdeveloped reproductive organs
What causes PHACE syndrome?
Researchers don’t know why some babies are born with PHACE syndrome. Studies suggest both genetic and environmental causes. The exact
genetic variation
(change) isn’t well understood. Some experts believe that a random (de novo) gene change happens at
conception
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is PHACE syndrome diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical exam
and testing. They’ll use diagnostic criteria (guidelines) to determine if your child has PHACE syndrome. Sometimes, providers can diagnose PHACE syndrome during your pregnancy. Other times, the condition isn’t obvious until birth or later in infancy.
Typically, your child’s provider will look for the presence of a hemangioma on your baby’s body. They may also run several tests to get a closer look at your child’s brain, heart, arteries and eyes.
These tests may include:
CT scans
Echocardiograms
Eye exams
Hearing tests
MRI
Ultrasound
Management and Treatment
How is PHACE syndrome treated?
PHACE syndrome treatment focuses on preventing complications and helping your child manage their symptoms. Treatment varies based on how the condition affects their organs or specific parts of their body.
Treatment may include:
Laser therapy for hemangiomas
Learning support in school (special education)
Surgery
Medications
Supportive devices for hearing loss or glasses for vision loss
Many families speak with a
genetic counselor
to learn more about treatment options for their child and how to support them as they grow.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has PHACE syndrome?
Your child will need regular check-ups with their primary care physician and specialists to make sure their symptoms aren’t affecting their quality of life.
While this condition affects your child, it can also impact you and your family. Some people find support and comfort in speaking with a mental health professional.
What is the life expectancy for someone diagnosed with this syndrome?
Your child’s life expectancy with PHACE syndrome varies based on the severity of their symptoms and which organs the condition affects.
Children diagnosed with severe brain and heart symptoms are more likely to have a short life expectancy. If your child has mild symptoms, they may have an average lifespan.
Prevention
Can it be prevented?
There’s no way to prevent PHACE syndrome. The cause isn’t well understood, which means you can’t reduce your risk of having a child diagnosed with this condition.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
It may be overwhelming to learn that your child has a rare condition and that there’s not much known about its cause. This can have an emotional effect on you and your family. While some children survive well into adulthood, others may have severe symptoms that could lead to a short life expectancy. You and your family may find comfort in joining a support group or speaking with a genetic counselor or mental health professional.
