Overview
What is aquagenic pruritus?
Aquagenic pruritus is a skin condition that causes your skin to itch when water touches it. It does not cause visible symptoms such as hives or rashes. People with this condition experience symptoms within minutes of exposure to water. The itching and burning sensations can last for an hour or longer.

It can occur almost anywhere on your body. The most common location is your legs, followed by your arms, chest and back.
It usually doesn’t affect the palms of your hands, soles of your feet or mucus membranes like the insides of your mouth, nose and ears. This means people can drink water without symptoms.
