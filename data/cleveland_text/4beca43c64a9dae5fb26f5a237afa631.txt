Black Widow Spider Bite
The black widow is a type of spider with a shiny black body. Females have a red hourglass marking on their bellies. A female black widow spider bite can be dangerous. A bite from a female releases a toxic venom that attacks your nerve endings, causing severe muscle aches and pains. If you think a black widow bit you, seek medical care right away.

Overview
A female black widow spider builds a web.
What is a black widow spider?
The black widow spider is an eight-legged arachnid with a shiny black body that ranges from 1/4 inch to 1 3/8 inches long. Female black widows have a distinctive red hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of their bodies. Females are larger and more dangerous than males. Black widows get their name from the myth that the females eat the males after mating, leaving them “widowed,” but this rarely happens.

Where do black widow spiders live?
Black widow spiders mostly live in warm, dry climates in the Southern and Western U.S., but they can be found in all states except Hawaii and Alaska.
Black widows primarily live outdoors, where they build webs near garages, fences, woodpiles, building overhangs and other outdoor structures. They like to hide out in gardening equipment, outdoor furniture and garbage, as well. You may also find them in cluttered areas such as basements, closets, attics and under sinks.
How common are black widow spider bites?
Black widow spiders are a member of the Latrodectus family. People report about 2,600 Latrodectus-species bites to the National Poison Data System every year.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a black widow spider bite?
Black widow spiders have large fangs and glands that produce very toxic venom. When bitten, the venom attacks the nerve endings in your muscles, causing symptoms such as severe, bodywide
muscle pain
and cramping. However, only the female black widow bites. The males are too small and can’t break through human skin. Black widow
spider bites
typically occur when humans come into direct contact with their webs. They only bite when threatened.
A black widow spider bite causes a sharp, pinprick-like pain. A dull
numbness
in the bite area may follow. Black widow spider venom interferes with chemicals in your nerve endings. This can produce severe pain, stiffness and
muscle spasms
throughout your body, including your belly (abdomen), shoulders, chest and back.

Other black widow spider bite symptoms may include:
Trouble breathing (dyspnea)
.
Swollen or droopy eyes.
Headache
.
Increased saliva production.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Excessive sweating (
diaphoresis
).
Fever and chills.
What does a black widow spider bite look like?
You may see tiny red fang marks where the spider bit you. You may also have mild redness and swelling in the bite area. A blister may form, or you may have an itchy skin rash. In addition, your skin may turn bluish-gray (
cyanosis
) at the bite site.
What causes a black widow spider to bite?
Male black widow spiders rarely bite. They’re too small and not able to break your skin with their fangs. But female black widows may bite in defense, especially after they lay eggs. Most spider bites are accidents. If you accidentally brush up against a spider, it’s just trying to defend itself. They don’t purposely try to attack you.
What are the complications of a black widow spider bite?
You can get a skin condition called
cellulitis from a spider bite
. Cellulitis occurs when bacteria enter your skin and cause an infection.
Rarely, some people have long-term pain or muscle spasms after black widow spider bites.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a black widow spider bite diagnosed?
Healthcare providers can’t identify a particular spider based on its bite mark. There are no tests to confirm what kind of spider bit you. If you have the spider, bring it with you for confirmation. However, most of the time, you won’t have the spider. Providers usually diagnose a spider bite based on your symptoms.
Management and Treatment
What should I do if a black widow bites me?
If you think a black widow spider bit you:
Wash the area with soap and water.
Apply an ice pack to help reduce pain and swelling and to delay the effects of the venom. (Wrap the ice in a thin cloth — don’t apply the ice directly to your skin because direct contact can cause tissue damage.)
Elevate the wound site, if possible.
Don’t attempt to remove the venom (sucking out the venom is a dangerous practice that’s just as likely to envenom the person trying to do it).
In the U.S., call the National Capital Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222), and seek medical care. If you live outside the U.S., call the agency or organization specific to where you live.
How is a black widow spider bite treated?
Treatment for a black widow spider bite
may include:
Muscle relaxers
and sedatives, to help relieve muscle pain and spasms.
Analgesics
, to help reduce pain.
Antivenom
, to help reverse the effects of the venom, including bodywide muscle cramping.
Black widow bites are serious. Children younger than 16 and people older than 60 may need hospitalization to treat:
Breathing issues.
Heart problems.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Black widow spiders have a bad reputation. But like all spiders, they really don’t want to bite you. They only bite when they feel the need to defend themselves. To avoid a black widow spider’s wrath, clear the clutter in your garage, basement and attic. And wear gloves if you’re working in an area that may have spiders. You should seek immediate medical attention if a black widow spider bites you.
