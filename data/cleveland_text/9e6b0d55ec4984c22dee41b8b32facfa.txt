Meningocele
Meningocele is a type of spina bifida. It causes the protective layer around your baby’s spinal cord to push through an opening in their spine. A surgeon can repair it shortly after birth. Most children recover well with few long-term issues.

What Is Meningocele?
Babies with meningoceles typically have surgery soon after they’re born. Meningoceles rarely cause long-term medical issues.
Meningocele (pronounced “men-IN-go-seel”) is a condition where the protective layers around your baby’s spinal cord (
meninges
) stick out through a gap in their
spine
. It forms a bulge or a sac on their back. This occurs if the lower end of the neural tube doesn’t develop as expected during
fetal development
.

The lower spine is the most common spot for a bulge or sac to form. The sac is filled with fluid called
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). CSF normally cushions and protects your child’s brain and spinal cord.
Healthcare providers treat it with surgery within days after your baby is born. It rarely causes long-term or serious medical issues.
This condition is the least common type of
spina bifida
.
Types of meningocele
There are two types:
Open
: There isn’t skin covering the sac that sticks out of the opening in your child’s spine.
Closed
: Skin covers the sac that sticks out of your child’s spine.
Symptoms and Causes
Signs and symptoms of meningocele
The most noticeable sign is a fluid-filled lump (sac) on your baby’s back.
Symptoms aren’t common with this condition, but they may include:
Back pain
Changes to the sound of their cry
Coughing
Fluttering heartbeat
Muscle weakness
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Trouble swallowing
Meningocele causes
Like other types of spina bifida, this condition is a
neural tube defect
. The neural tube is an embryonic structure that develops into the brain and spinal cord. In meningocele, the spinal cord itself develops as expected. But the bones of the spine (vertebrae) don’t close completely. This leaves a gap in the spinal column.
The meninges (the protective membranes covering the spinal cord) push out through this gap, forming a fluid-filled sac. This sac contains the cerebrospinal fluid. As a result, the sac sticks out from your child’s back.

Risk factors
Research suggests that
women
with certain chronic conditions, like
diabetes
, or who take certain
antiseizure medications
, may have an increased risk of having a fetus with meningocele if they’re pregnant.
If you plan on expanding your family, talk to your providers to learn more about these risk factors and ways to have a healthy
pregnancy
.
Complications of meningocele
Complications may include:
Increased intracranial pressure
Infection
Paralysis
Problems with bowel and bladder control
Tethered spinal cord
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose meningocele
Healthcare providers may see signs of this condition while doing routine prenatal
blood
and
urine
tests. But usually, they’ll diagnose it after your baby is born. Providers typically take imaging tests to confirm a diagnosis. These noninvasive tests may include:
Magnetic resonance imaging (
MRI
) scan
Ultrasound
If providers detect this condition in the fetus, they may recommend a
C-section
(cesarean birth). This prevents damage to the sac around the spinal cord during delivery.
Management and Treatment
Meningocele treatment
Surgery to remove the fluid-filled sac often cures the condition. In meningocele repair, your child’s surgical team will:
Give your child general
anesthesia.
They’ll be asleep and won’t feel any pain.
Make an incision (cut) into the sac on your baby’s spine.
Drain the sac that pushed through your baby’s spine.
Place the meninges on your baby’s exposed spinal cord.
Close the incision.
If your child has an open type without skin around the sac, surgery may happen within 24 to 48 hours after birth. For the closed type, surgery may happen within 72 hours.
After the procedure, your newborn may need to spend up to two weeks in the hospital.
What are the complications of meningocele repair?
While this procedure is generally safe, it does come with some risks. These may include:
Bleeding
Infection
Reaction to anesthesia
Your child’s surgical team will take extra precautions to prevent complications and make sure your child is safe.
When should my child see their healthcare provider?
After surgery, your child’s surgeon will schedule regular visits to make sure they’re healing as expected. These visits will be in addition to seeing their pediatrician for regular check-ups to monitor their wellness and growth. If you have any questions about your child’s healing or development, reach out to their care team.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my baby is born with meningocele?
Your newborn’s healthcare providers will treat this condition quickly to prevent complications. Repairs usually have a successful outcome. You can expect to bring your child home from the hospital within a couple of weeks after they’ve healed from surgery. Stay up to date on their check-ups as they grow to make sure they don’t have any lingering issues (these are rare).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
When you hear “spina bifida,” you might think of the most common and most serious type. While meningocele is a form of spina bifida, its symptoms are usually less severe. In many cases, surgery shortly after birth resolves the issue, and long-term complications are rare.

Knowing this may ease some of your worries. If your baby is born with this condition, don’t hesitate to ask questions and share your concerns with their healthcare team.
