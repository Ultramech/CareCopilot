Cancers in children are different from those in adults. And some cancers are more common in children. Pediatric oncologists know your child is still growing and developing, and that they have unique medical needs. They have special training in examining and treating children. They also know your child may be scared or nervous — and know how to make your child feel comfortable and relaxed. They focus on the wants and needs of children, often making treatment areas more inviting.
Pediatric hematologists/oncologists do more than diagnose and treat your child’s disease. These doctors provide complete care for your child and your family. They look for the best medical treatment options available for your child. But they also coordinate emotional support during your most difficult days. They’ll put together a team that may include:
A
child life specialist
A
child psychologist
Art and
music therapists
This team will be with you every step of the way.

Additional Common Questions
How many years does it take to become a pediatric oncologist?
It takes 14 to 16 years to become a pediatric hematologist/oncologist. You must have a bachelor’s degree (four years) and get a medical degree (four years). After medical school, you’ll need to do a residency in pediatrics (three years). Finally, you must complete a fellowship in pediatric hematology/oncology (at least three years). After that, you can apply for certification from the American Board of Pediatrics.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It doesn’t feel real. You’ve just heard the words no parent ever wants to hear: “Your child has cancer.” Your emotions may be all over the place. You’re trying to keep it together for your child. Suddenly, nothing else matters but getting your child well.
Pediatric oncologists know about these feelings. They’re more than just doctors. They’re people you can lean on in your most trying moments. Your child’s pediatric oncologist may become like family as you work your way through this experience. They’ll never let you walk alone.
