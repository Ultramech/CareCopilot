Overview
What is eisoptrophobia?
You may have eisoptrophobia if you have an intense fear of mirrors. Eisoptrophobia is a specific phobia, which means it causes fear of a particular situation. The fear is typically much greater than the actual risk of danger. Eisoptrophobia may also be called spectrophobia or catoptrophobia.

People with a specific phobia often have many phobias. In addition to eisoptrophobia, they may also have:
Atelophobia:
Fear of imperfection.
Cacophobia:
Fear of ugliness.

What is a phobia?
Being fearful of things that make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable is common. Many people fear needle pokes, flying and snake encounters. These things may cause anxiety. But thinking about them does not disrupt daily life.
Phobias are intense feelings of fear. It may be challenging to get a phobia off your mind. You may go out of your way to avoid situations that trigger the phobia. These efforts can overtake rational thinking and worsen over time.
Do I have eisoptrophobia?
Mirrors are typically a part of everyday life. They help us see images of ourselves and can protect us from danger (for example, mirrors in or on vehicles). But some people fear images due to self-image issues. People may also avoid mirrors because they may distort the way an object looks. If you have eisoptrophobia, the thought of mirrors can bring intense anxiety. This can sometimes lead to
panic attacks
.

If you have signs of eisoptrophobia, discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider. You should be honest with them about what you are experiencing. They can offer reassurance and refer you to therapies that make life a little less stressful.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes a fear of mirrors?
Many healthcare providers agree that genetics and your environment can increase your risk:
Genetics:
A family history of
mood disorders
means you may carry genes that cause phobias.
Environment:
If you experience emotional trauma related to mirrors, you may be more likely to develop a phobia of them. Some people have bad experiences with mirrors because of scary movies or mirror-based attractions at carnivals.
Cultural beliefs may also play a role in eisoptrophobia. Many cultures believe that the souls of deceased loved ones travel through or get trapped in mirrors. This is why mirrors are often covered or turned away when a family is in mourning.
What are eisoptrophobia symptoms?
Seeing a mirror can cause a combination of negative behaviors and physical responses.
Negative behaviors:
You may go out of your way to avoid mirrors by:
Removing mirrors from your home.
Not buying items, like makeup kits, that have mirrors.
Giving up your driver’s license because the safety mirrors make you uncomfortable.
Avoiding public outings due to fear that you’ll encounter a mirror.
Physical responses:
Physical symptoms may include:
Chills
.
Dizziness
and lightheadedness.
Excessive sweating (
hyperhidrosis
).
Heart palpitations
.
Nausea
.
Shortness of breath
(dyspnea).

indigestion

Diagnosis and Tests
How is eisoptrophobia diagnosed?
Healthcare providers use a mental health evaluation to diagnose eisoptrophobia. There isn’t a specific test to diagnose eisoptrophobia. Your provider will ask you about your symptoms, mental health history and whether you have other phobias. They may refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in phobias and anxiety disorders.
Management and Treatment
What is eisoptrophobia treatment like?
A common treatment for eisoptrophobia is exposure therapy. It gradually exposes you to situations that trigger your fear of mirrors. Exposure therapy for eisoptrophobia may start by looking at pictures of mirrors. Over time, you may progress to looking at real mirrors. With successful treatment, seeing mirrors becomes less bothersome.
Can other treatments help me cope with a fear of mirrors?
Additional treatments may include:
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT):
Mental health professionals use
CBT
to help you explore thoughts and feelings associated with mirrors. You also develop healthy alternatives to negative thoughts or behaviors.
Medications:
Taking medications does not cure eisoptrophobia. But
antidepressants
and antianxiety medications can get you through a challenging time. If you start driving again and are anxious about rearview mirrors, medications can make using them less stressful.
Stress reduction:
These techniques help quiet your mind and relax your body. Yoga and
meditation
can help you become more in tune with your thoughts and feelings. This can reduce the likelihood of panic when you see a mirror.
