Overview
What is a topical anesthetic?
A topical anesthetic is a type of local anesthetic that temporarily numbs the area to which you or a healthcare provider apply it. It provides symptom relief by reducing pain and itchiness (
pruritus
) in an area. Topical means you spread it on a surface — it’s not an injection.

Medical uses for topical anesthetics
Healthcare providers use topical anesthetics for various medical purposes and procedures. Sometimes, it’s the only type of anesthetic they use, and other times they apply it before a local anesthetic injection.
Skin applications include:
To minimize discomfort before injections (like
vaccines
) or inserting IV (intravenous) and arterial lines.
To relieve pain before minor dermatologic and laser procedures, like
laser hair removal
,
tattoo removal
, and shave or excision
biopsies
.

How do topical anesthetics work?
Topical anesthetics work by blocking signals in
nerve
endings in your skin or mucosa. This temporarily blocks sensations — like pain, touch and itchiness — in a limited area. Topical anesthetics are superficial, which means they only provide numbness for the upper layers of your skin and mucosa.

Additional Common Questions
How should I use topical anesthetics?
Talk to your healthcare provider and carefully read the instructions for OTC topical anesthetics before using them. The packaging will give you instructions on where to use the product and how much and how often to apply it.
If you’re going to use a topical anesthetic on your child, make sure they’re old enough per the guidelines on the packaging. Once you apply it to your child’s skin, make sure they don’t get any of it in their mouth. Topical anesthetics can cause serious side effects if they get in your mouth or you swallow them, especially in children.

When you’re not using a topical anesthetic, store it safely away from children and pets.
What are the side effects of topical anesthetics?
Because there are several types of topical anesthetics — and they can be combined with other medications and active ingredients — there’s a wide range of possible side effects. If you’re using an over-the-counter (OTC) topical anesthetic, read the packaging to learn about the possible side effects to look out for.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Topical anesthetics can provide temporary pain and itch relief on your skin and mucosa. They can be helpful for minor nuisances like bug bites and mild rashes.
