Types of Eye Doctors
All eye care specialists play an important role in maintaining your eye health and vision. But they all have different specialties. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are eye doctors who diagnose and treat issues that affect your eyes. Opticians help you choose the right corrective lenses. And ocularists make and maintain prosthetic eyes.

Only certain types of eye care specialists are medical doctors (MDs), but it’s common to refer to any specialist who takes care of your eyes as your eye doctor.
You should see an eye doctor every few years to have your eyes examined and your vision checked.
What are the types of eye doctors?
There are four main types of eye specialists:
Ophthalmologists
.
Ophthalmologists are medical doctors (MDs) or doctors of osteopathy (DOs). They go to medical school and choose to specialize in eyes. They can diagnose and treat any condition that affects your eyes and vision, and they’re the only ones that can perform surgery.
Optometrists
.
Doctors of optometry (OD), or optometrists, go to optometry school. They can diagnose and treat lots of common
eye diseases
and vision problems, but they can’t perform surgery.
Opticians
.
Opticians are eye care specialists who help you choose the right
eyeglasses
,
contact lenses
or other vision correction devices.
Ocularists
.
Ocularists are eye specialists who provide care to anyone who needs a
prosthetic eye
. They specialize in creating and maintaining prosthetic eyes.
What do eye doctors treat?
Both ophthalmologists and optometrists can treat the most common conditions that affect your vision, including:
Astigmatism
Diplopia (double vision)
Dry eye
Low vision
Myopia (nearsightedness)
and
hyperopia (farsightedness)
Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
Presbyopia
and other
age-related eye problems

If you need more advanced medical care, or if you need surgery, you should see an ophthalmologist.
Opticians and ocularists work with your eye doctor to provide the care you need.
How do I choose an eye care specialist?
The type of eye specialist you need to see depends on which symptoms you’re experiencing and which issues or conditions you need to address:
You’ll probably visit an
optometrist
for your routine eye exam every few years. They can also diagnose and treat the most common conditions that affect your eyes. They specialize in glasses and contacts.
You’ll need to visit an
ophthalmologist
if you need advanced care, or if you need eye surgery. They can also provide all your regular eye care, too, including performing general eye exams and giving you prescriptions for glasses.
Opticians
usually work with optometrists and ophthalmologists. They can check the fit of your eyeglasses or contact lenses and show you how to wear them safely.
Ocularists
work with other eye care specialists, as well. You’ll see an ocularist if you’re missing an eye or part of your eye due to injury,
infection
or a congenital (present at birth) condition.
Talk to your
primary care physician
(PCP) if you’re not sure which type of eye care specialist you should see.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Eye doctors and other eye care specialists help keep your eyes healthy and maintain your ability to see clearly. Whether it’s for a routine eye exam or a more serious condition that needs surgery, everyone needs to visit an eye specialist throughout their lives. If you notice any changes in your vision or have other symptoms affecting your eyes, you should visit an eye doctor or specialist as soon as possible.
