Blepharochalasis
Blepharochalasis is a rare condition that causes painless swelling in your eyelids. Experts don’t know what causes it. Most people with blepharochalasis experience episodes of symptoms on and off for a few years. Visit an eye care specialist as soon you notice any new swelling in or around your eyes to rule out other, more dangerous conditions.

Overview
What is blepharochalasis?
Blepharochalasis is a rare condition that causes painless swelling in your eyelids. The
inflammation
will come and go in episodes — times when you’re experiencing symptoms.

You might see blepharochalasis referred to as blepharochalasis syndrome. Healthcare providers use these names interchangeably, but they’re the same condition. Blepharochalasis is pronounced bleff-air-OH-kall-ISS-siss.
Experts don’t know what causes blepharochalasis, or why it comes back. Blepharochalasis won’t affect your
vision
, but the swelling might make your eyelid block part of your eye and lower your peripheral vision while you’re experiencing an episode.
Even though it doesn’t damage your eyes, the skin and other tissue on your eyelid can become permanently stretched out. Swelling then shrinking during and after blepharochalasis episodes can cause this.
Blepharochalasis usually affects your upper eyelids. Most people experience it bilaterally — blepharochalasis that affects both eyes at the same time. It’s less common, but some people do experience unilateral blepharochalasis — swelling in only one eyelid during an episode.
People with blepharochalasis have episodes every few months. Usually, episodes come and go (recur) for a few years before it enters a quiescent stage — the medical term for a condition that’s inactive.
There usually isn’t any specific treatment for blepharochalasis. An
eye care specialist
might prescribe medications that reduce inflammation to help with the swelling. Some people eventually need surgery to repair stretched out skin on their eyelids.

Who does blepharochalasis affect?
Blepharochalasis can affect anyone. Most people with blepharochalasis develop it when they’re kids before
puberty
, usually around 11 years old.
Some studies have found that
females
might be more likely to develop blepharochalasis.
How common is blepharochalasis?
Blepharochalasis is rare. Experts don’t know for certain how many people have it each year because it’s so rarely reported. Providers sometimes misdiagnose it as a symptom of another condition.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of blepharochalasis?
The most common symptom of blepharochalasis is inflammation in your upper eyelids. Most people experience swelling for a few days during an episode.
Blepharochalasis doesn’t make your vision worse or affect any of the parts inside your eye that help you see. But, depending on how swollen your eyelids are, they might block part of your eye during an episode.
A blepharochalasis episode might cause other symptoms in your eyes and eyelids, including:
Eyelids that look or feel thin and stretched out.
Discolored skin on and near your eyelids.
Red eye
.
Watery eyes
.
What causes blepharochalasis?
Experts aren’t sure what causes blepharochalasis.
Studies have found links between blepharochalasis and changes in your
hormones
(the chemicals that carry messages through your blood to your organs, skin, muscles and other tissues). Some hormone changes that might trigger blepharochalasis include:
Puberty.
Menstruation
.
Bee stings.
Fatigue
.
Stress
.
Infections that cause
fevers
.
Traumas or
eye injuries
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is blepharochalasis diagnosed?
An eye care specialist will diagnose blepharochalasis with an
eye exam
. They’ll look at your eyelids and eyes (including inside them).
You might need a blood test to rule out infections.
Usually, an eye care specialist will rule out other conditions that cause swelling in your eyelids before diagnosing you with blepharochalasis. They might call this a
differential diagnosis
. Some conditions with similar symptoms as blepharochalasis include:
Blepharitis
.
Angioedema
.
Thyroid eye disease
.
Sarcoidosis
.
Ascher syndrome.
Idiopathic orbital inflammation (swelling with no known cause).
Floppy eyelid syndrome.
Management and Treatment
How is blepharochalasis treated?
Most people don’t need treatment for blepharochalasis.
Because it’s so rare and doesn’t damage your eyes or cause pain, an eye care specialist will focus more on managing the swelling when you’re experiencing an episode. They might suggest you take medications that reduce inflammation. Some medications used to treat swelling caused by blepharochalasis include:
Corticosteroids
.
Over-the-counter (OTC)
NSAIDs
.
Antihistamines
.
Immunosuppressants
.
You might need
eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty)
if the skin on your eyelids is permanently damaged or stretched out from the swelling. If you need surgery, an
ophthalmologist
will tell you what to expect and how long it’ll take to recover.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have blepharochalasis?
If you have blepharochalasis, you should expect to have episodes to come and go for at least a few years. Episodes usually last for a few days.
How long you’ll have blepharochalasis (and how long each episode lasts) can be unpredictable. Talk to an eye care specialist about what to expect.
Blepharochalasis can increase your risk of developing other conditions that affect your eyelids, including:
Ptosis
(drooping eyelids).
Entropion
(your eyelids turn in toward your eye).
Ectropion
(your eyelid turns out, away from your eye).
Prevention
How can I prevent blepharochalasis?
Because experts don’t know for sure what causes blepharochalasis, there’s nothing you can do to prevent it.
Visit a healthcare provider or eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your eyes — especially if you’re experiencing swelling.

When should I have my eyes examined?
Having your eyes and vision checked regularly can help your eye care specialist identify problems right away. How often you should get your eyes checked usually depends on your age:
Kids:
A
pediatrician
should check your child’s eyes around the time they learn the alphabet, and then every one to two years.
Adults younger than 40:
Every five to 10 years.
Adults between 40 and 54:
Every two to four years.
Adults older than 55:
Every one to three years.

You might need your eyes checked more often than this if you wear glasses, contacts or need another type of visual aid. People with
diabetes
need their eyes checked more often than what’s listed here.
Ask an eye care specialist how often you need an eye exam.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See a healthcare provider or eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your eyelids, eyes or vision.
Go to the emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms:
A sudden loss of vision.
Severe
eye pain
.
You see new
flashes or floaters
in your eyes.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
Do I have blepharochalasis or another eyelid condition?
Which treatments will I need?
Will I need surgery?
How long do you think I’ll have blepharochalasis episodes?
What symptoms should I watch out for?
Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between blepharochalasis and dermatochalasis?
Both blepharochalasis and dermatochalasis are conditions that affect the skin on your eyelids. They can both lead to drooping or stretched skin above your eyes. The difference is what causes them.
Blepharochalasis causes stretched skin on your eyelids after episodes of swelling and shrinking. Over time, this can stretch your skin out and make your eyelids droop (ptosis).
Dermatochalasis is drooping eyelid skin that’s usually caused by aging. Over time, the connective tissue in your skin loses some its natural tension and can start to droop or sag. If dermatochalasis affects your upper eyelids, they can hang down over your eyes and block some of your peripheral vision. An eye care specialist might refer to this as lateral hooding.

What is the difference between blepharochalasis and blepharitis?
Blepharochalasis is inflammation in your whole eyelid (usually both eyelids) that comes and goes in episodes of symptoms. Experts don’t know for sure what causes it.
Blepharitis is swelling that only affects the edges of your eyelids. It’s caused by conditions that irritate the skin on your eyelids. Certain skin conditions, infections or blocked meibomian glands (oil glands in your eyelids) lead to irritation, discoloration, pain or a burning feeling.
Visit an eye care specialist if you notice new symptoms in or around your eyes. They’ll diagnose the cause of the swelling and tell you which treatments you’ll need.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Blepharochalasis makes your eyelids swell in periods called episodes. Most people have episodes of inflammation every few months for years. Blepharochalasis isn’t painful, and won’t harm your vision. Experts aren’t sure what causes it.
You might not need any treatment during an episode. Some people need surgery to repair the skin on their eyelids if episodes of blepharochalasis stretch them out and make them droopy.
Even though blepharochalasis isn’t usually dangerous, visit an eye care specialist as soon as you experience any swelling in or near your eyes. Other conditions with similar symptoms can spread to or hurt your eyes if they’re not diagnosed quickly. The sooner you get new swelling or discoloration examined, the less likely it is you’ll experience complications.
