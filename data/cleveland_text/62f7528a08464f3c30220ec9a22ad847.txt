Presyncope
Presyncope is feeling like you’re about to faint, but you don’t. You may feel lightheaded, sick to your stomach or sweaty, among other symptoms. For many people, presyncope is a minor episode. But others may find that something serious is causing their issue. Many conditions, including some heart-related ones, cause this.

physical exam
. They may ask you questions like:
What were you doing when you started to feel symptoms?
Have you experienced this before?
What were you doing right before you felt symptoms the other times?
Is there a history of fainting or heart issues in your family?

.
Heart rhythm monitor like a
Holter monitor
or Zio® patch.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have presyncope?
If you seek medical attention, a provider may admit you to a hospital or send you home after treatment. Then, you’ll need a follow-up appointment with your
primary care provider
(PCP).
If a provider finds a serious issue, you’ll need to see a
cardiologist
or another specialist. The cause of your presyncope determines how serious it is.
A study found that even having one of certain issues predicts a serious outcome for people with presyncope. These issues are:
Heart failure
.
Shortness of breath
.
Systolic (first number)
blood pressure
below 90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). This is a number lower than normal.
Abnormal EKG results.
A
hematocrit test
result of less than 30%. This means you have a low percentage of red blood cells in your blood (
anemia
).
Prevention
Can presyncope be prevented?
Yes, you may be able to prevent presyncope if you know the cause. You can lower your risk in these ways:
Drink fluids before
giving blood
or getting a
vaccination
. Sit while receiving a vaccine.
Avoid upsetting things, like horror movies.
Stand up slowly.
Eat smaller meals.
Get treatment for a medical condition that’s causing presyncope.
Living With
How do I take care of myself?
If you know what’s causing presyncope in your case, do what you can to prevent it. For example, if you know it happens in hot, crowded rooms, try to plan for that. Bring a small fan, get a seat near a window or take breaks to step outside for fresh air every so often.

If you feel an episode coming on, try sitting or lying down, clenching your fists or crossing your legs.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should follow up with a provider after having an episode of presyncope. In many cases, they can help you figure out the cause or refer you to someone who can. You should get immediate help if you pass out (lose consciousness). Someone with you should call an ambulance.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
Questions to consider asking your healthcare provider may include:
What’s causing my presyncope?
If a medical condition is causing it, do I need treatment for that?
How soon can I get treatment for it?
Are others in my family at risk for presyncope?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Whether it’s your first presyncope experience or not, it’s unsettling. You may wonder if you’re going to faint and get hurt. You may feel embarrassed when people keep asking if you’re OK. But you can take charge by finding out the cause and getting treatment for it.
