What’s the difference between Western medicine and Chinese (Eastern) medicine?
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) focuses on a vital life force energy called Qi or Chi (pronounced “chee”). Practitioners of Chinese medicine believe illness occurs when your yin and yang are imbalanced. These are the components that make up your life force.
Chinese medicine is also known as Eastern medicine or East Asian medicine. This is because it has its roots in the eastern part of the world, mostly China.
Although Chinese medicine is more than 3,000 years old, it’s not well-researched. Compared to Western medicine practices, there are fewer scientific studies supporting its effectiveness. But there are evidence-based findings in support of some Chinese medicine practices. That’s why some Western medicine physicians incorporate them as
complementary therapy
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
When you visit your primary care doctor or go to a hospital, you get traditional Western medical care. Western medicine focuses on scientifically proven methods for diagnosing and treating illnesses. Still, many providers of Western medicine also use complementary medicine therapies. These may include Chinese or Eastern medicine techniques like acupuncture. Some complementary therapies, like herbal supplements, can interact with Western medicine treatments. So, you should always talk to your healthcare provider before trying a new therapy.
