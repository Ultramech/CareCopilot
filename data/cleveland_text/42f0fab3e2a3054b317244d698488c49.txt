Oliguria (Low Urine Output)
Oliguria is the medical term for low urine output or peeing less than you expect. There are many different causes. If you have a blockage, your kidneys are producing pee but it can’t easily leave your body. If you aren’t producing pee, you may have a condition that affects your kidneys, heart or lungs. Treatment depends on the cause.

What Is Oliguria?
Oliguria is low urine output. It can cause swelling and pain. It can also affect your heart rate and blood pressure.
Oliguria (pronounced al-uh-GYOOR-ee-uh) is a medical term for low
urine
output (how much you pee). “Oliguria” is a big word. Breaking it apart can help you understand the meaning:

Oligo-
. This comes from the Greek word “oligos,” which means “few” or “little.”
-uria
. This comes from the Greek word “ouria,” which means “to urinate.”
In adults, oliguria means you pee less than 400 milliliters (mL) to 500 mL (around two cups) of pee per 24 hours.
For infants and children, the numbers depend on weight. For an infant, the output is less than 1 mL/kilogram (kg)/hour. For children, the output is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour.
Low urine output is relatively common because it can have so many causes. It’s not always dangerous. But it can be, depending on the cause.
Types of oliguria
Healthcare providers may classify oliguria according to how long it takes to develop:
Acute oliguria
. This type develops suddenly.
Chronic oliguria
. This type takes longer to develop. Chronic oliguria is more likely to occur if you’re on long-term
dialysis
.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of oliguria
The primary symptom of oliguria is that you’re not peeing as much as you should be. Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause. They may include:
Abdominal pain
Cold hands
and
feet
Flank pain
Heart rate
that’s faster than normal (
tachycardia
)
High acid levels in your blood (
metabolic acidosis
)
High potassium levels in your blood (
hyperkalemia
)
High waste levels in your blood (
uremia
)
Low blood pressure
(hypotension)
Swelling (
edema
)

What causes oliguria?
Oliguria can be:
Pre-renal
. This means something happens in your
urinary system
before the waste process gets to your
kidneys
.
Renal
. There’s something affecting your kidneys. “Renal” means it relates to the kidneys.
Post-renal
. Something happens later in the waste removal process, after your kidneys filter your blood.
Pre-renal causes
Pre-renal causes may include:
Heart
and
lung
conditions
Low blood volume (
hypovolemia
), which can be caused by heavy blood loss, decreased fluid intake,
burns
,
sepsis
,
liver failure
and surgery
Vascular disease
of your kidneys
Renal causes
Renal causes may include:
Kidney damage due to medications or toxins
Kidney disorders, including
glomerulonephritis
and
acute tubular necrosis
Post-renal causes
Post-renal causes refer to blockages in your urinary system, such as a:
Bladder outlet obstruction
Ureteral stone
If you have a blockage, your kidneys still make pee, but the pee can’t leave your body.
Is oliguria dehydration?
Not always. But a low urine output can result from not drinking enough fluids (
dehydration
).
Risk factors
Low urine output can happen to anyone. But it’s more likely to happen if you have certain types of kidney diseases that can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).
Low urine output is somewhat common among people who are on dialysis or who are already in the hospital. You may also be at a greater risk of developing oliguria if you’re 50 or older.
What happens if you don’t pee enough?
One of the most common complications in acute oliguria is that your kidneys suddenly can’t do a good job filtering toxins or wastes from your blood. This can lead to acute kidney failure. Potentially deadly complications of acute kidney failure include:
Electrolyte imbalances
, including high levels of potassium (
hyperkalemia
) and acids (
metabolic acidosis
)
Neurological disorders
, including overactive reflexes in your muscles (
hyperreflexia
),
seizures
and
coma
Problems with the organs in your
digestive system
, including
gastrointestinal bleeding
and
inflammation
in your stomach lining (
gastritis
)
Problems with your
heart
and
blood vessels
, including an abnormal
heartbeat
(
arrhythmia
),
congestive heart failure
and
high blood pressure
Problems with your lungs, including abnormal breathing patterns (
Kussmaul breathing
)
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose oliguria
A healthcare provider will take a complete medical history and perform a physical exam. They may also recommend tests such as:
Blood tests
Imaging tests, including
CT scans
and an
ultrasound
of your
kidney
or
urinary bladder
Urine tests (
urinalysis
), including tests to measure how much you pee and what components are in it
Management and Treatment
How do you fix oliguria?
Oliguria treatment depends on the cause of low urine output:

If you can’t pee much because there’s a blockage, a healthcare provider will remove the blockage. This is true for blockages in your urinary system and blockages that happen when there’s a kink in a urinary catheter.
If you have an infection, you’ll get the correct
antibiotics
or
antifungals
.
If a medication has damaged your kidneys, a provider will stop that medication and replace it with another, if necessary.
If your urine output is low because
vomiting
or
diarrhea
causes dehydration, a provider will help you rehydrate by helping you drink fluids or
intravenous (IV) fluids
.
If you have kidney failure, you may need dialysis.
A provider may also recommend that you eat foods that provide the right amount of protein and calories for your condition.
Should I drink water if I can’t pee?
It depends on the cause. You should drink fluids if your urine output is low because you haven’t been taking in enough fluids. Plain water and rehydration solutions that contain electrolytes are good options. Some rehydration options include:
Clear broth
Diluted juices
Sports drinks
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have issues with your heart or kidneys, make sure you follow any directions a healthcare provider makes regarding medications, fluid intake and food choices. If you notice you aren’t peeing as much as you usually do, try increasing your fluid intake and contact a provider. One sign of dehydration and reduced urine output is that the
color of your pee
turns a darker yellow.

You may wish to ask a provider questions such as:
What’s affecting my urine output?
Is it serious?
Do I have severe symptoms?
What treatment do you recommend?
Should I look out for any signs of complications?
Do I need to adjust what I eat and drink?
Should I see a
dietitian
?
Get help right away if you aren’t peeing as much as you think you should be and you have symptoms like:
Abdominal pain
Confusion
Feeling very tired (
fatigue
)
Fever

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have oliguria?
Your outlook depends on what’s affecting your urine output. But if you’re not peeing as much as you should be, that’s your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong, and you should reach out to a healthcare provider right away. Without treatment, serious complications can develop.
Prevention
How can oliguria be prevented?
If you have diarrhea or are vomiting, make every effort to keep taking in fluids. It’s important to note low urine output as early as you can.
If you have problems breathing or issues with your kidneys or heart, follow a healthcare provider’s directions as far as how much you should drink each day and what you should eat.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Many people find it awkward to talk about peeing. But keeping track of how often and how much you pee is an important way to monitor your health. If you’ve been vomiting or have diarrhea, try to drink more water to prevent dehydration. If you’re drinking normally and aren’t peeing as much as you think you should, it’s time to call a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and treatment. They understand it can be a little uncomfortable for some to talk about their bathroom habits, so they’ll do their best to help you relax.
