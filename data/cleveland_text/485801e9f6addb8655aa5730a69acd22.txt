This condition can include gaming on the internet or any electronic device, but most people who develop significant gaming issues mainly play on the internet.
Whether internet and video gaming addiction should be classified as an addiction or mental illness is debated among researchers. Many researchers consider video game addiction a behavioral addiction similar to
gambling disorder
, in which the rush of winning becomes one of the main reasons for playing.
Others think this comparison to gambling is flawed because there may not be financial or material losses involved with playing video games. In addition, winning a video game may require cognitive skills and sharp reflexes, while winning at gambling is mainly a matter of chance.
Regardless of this debate, any activity or habit that becomes all-consuming and negatively impacts your daily functioning can cause significant mental, social and physical health issues. It’s important to seek medical care if you think your video game habits are taking over your life.
Who does video game addiction affect?
Video game addiction can affect children, teens and adults, although adults are most likely to have this condition.
How common is video game addiction?
Researchers estimate that video game addiction affects between 1.7% and 10% of the U.S. population. The estimated range is large because many researchers disagree on the diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs and symptoms of video game addiction?
Signs and symptoms of video game addiction (internet gaming disorder) include:
Poor performance at school, work or household responsibilities as a result of excessive video game playing.
Withdrawal symptoms, such as sadness, anxiety or irritability, when games are taken away or gaming isn’t possible.
A need to spend more and more time playing video games to get the same level of enjoyment.
Giving up other previously enjoyed activities and/or social relationships due to gaming.
Being unable to reduce playing time and having unsuccessful attempts to quit gaming despite the negative consequences it’s causing.
Lying to family members or others about the amount of time spent playing video games.
A decline in personal hygiene or grooming due to excessive video gaming.
Using video games as a way to escape stressful situations at work or school or to avoid conflicts at home.
Using video games to relieve negative moods, such as guilt or hopelessness.
If you or a loved one are experiencing these signs and symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional.
What causes video game addiction?
Researchers are still trying to determine the exact cause of video game addiction and the addictive qualities of internet and video games.
So far, researchers think the process of playing and winning video games may trigger a release of
dopamine
. Dopamine is a brain chemical (
neurotransmitter
) that plays a key role in several bodily functions, including pleasurable reward and motivation. Dopamine is the same neurotransmitter involved in other use disorders, including gambling disorder and
substance use disorder
.
Recent neurological research shows similarities in the brains of people with video game addiction and substance use disorders.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is video game addiction diagnosed?
To be diagnosed with video game addiction (internet gaming disorder), your healthcare provider may refer you to a mental health professional such as a
psychologist
or
psychiatrist
.
Mental health professionals use the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (
DSM-5
)
to diagnose mental disorders, which includes information about internet gaming disorder.
Your mental health professional will ask questions about your medical and personal history, including gaming patterns and more.
In general, for internet gaming disorder to be diagnosed, your gaming behavior patterns must be extreme enough to result in significant impairment to your personal, family, social, educational and/or occupational functioning. These patterns usually have to exist for at least one year.

Management and Treatment
How is video game addiction treated?
The main treatment option for video game addiction (internet gaming disorder) is talk therapy (psychotherapy).
Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help you identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts and behaviors. Working with a mental health professional (such as a psychologist or psychiatrist) can provide support, education and guidance to you and your family.
Specific types of psychotherapy that may benefit someone with video game addiction include:
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
:
This is a structured, goal-oriented type of therapy. A therapist or psychologist helps you take a close look at your thoughts and emotions. You’ll come to understand how your thoughts affect your actions. Through CBT for video game addiction, you can unlearn negative and obsessive thoughts and behaviors and learn to adopt healthier thinking patterns and habits.
Group therapy:
This is a type of psychotherapy in which a group of people meets to describe and discuss their problems together under the supervision of a therapist or psychologist. Group therapy is a valuable source of motivation and moral support for people who have video game addiction, especially if they’ve lost contact with friends or peers as a result of their video game addiction.
Family or marriage counseling:
This type of therapy can help educate loved ones about the disorder and create a more stable home environment.
