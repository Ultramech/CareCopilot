What is the difference between a blackhead and a dilated pore of Winer?
The difference between a blackhead and a dilated pore of Winer is size. A dilated pore of Winer is a large blackhead. Both are formed because of
clogged pores
. A mixture of air and the exposed contents of the clogged pore turn the blemish black (oxidization).
Who does a dilated pore of Winer affect?
A dilated pore of Winer occurs in adults and can appear as early as 20 years old. However, cases usually appear after age 40 and are most common in older ages. Men are more likely to get a dilated pore of Winer, and the tumors are more frequent in people who are white.
Are dilated pores of Winer bad?
Although commonly identified as a tumor, dilated pores of Winer are not a sign of cancer (they are benign). Dilated pores of Winer cannot be spread (non-infectious) and pose no threat to your overall health.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a dilated pore of Winer?
The symptoms of a dilated pore of Winer include:
One enlarged, raised, circular pore covered by a blue to black dot (plug) with normal surrounding skin.
It is located on the head, neck, face or torso.
It does not cause any pain or discomfort (asymptomatic).
Does it hurt to have a dilated pore of Winer?
Unless you injure the pore, squeeze or pick it, your dilated pore of Winer should not be painful (asymptomatic). If your dilated pore of Winer is sore, red or leaking pus, it is infected. Make sure you clean the pore as you would a wound and use an antibiotic ointment if you notice an infection. You can also reach out to your healthcare provider to either remove the infected pore or treat it with
antibiotics

What causes a dilated pore of Winer?
A dilated pore of Winer forms similar to a blackhead pimple, where dead skin cells clog the pore (
hair follicle
). As a result, the dead skin cells in the pore create a protein (sebum and keratin) that collects and plugs up the pore, causing the pore to enlarge (dilate). The clogged pore turns black when the contents of it combine with air exposure (oxidization).
While the direct cause of a dilated pore of Winer is unknown, it has been associated with people who have a history of severe
acne
and/or
cystic acne
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a dilated pore of Winer diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider can diagnose a dilated pore of Winer by a visual examination. You should not need any test to diagnose this condition.
Management and Treatment
How is a dilated pore of Winer treated?
No treatment is necessary unless your dilated pore of Winer becomes red, swollen and/or leaks pus (infection). You can treat the infection by cleaning the pore and using an antibiotic ointment. If the infection persists, reach out to your healthcare provider to examine the pore and offer treatment options like prescribing an antibiotic to help fight infection.
In most cases, your healthcare provider can remove a dilated pore of Winer if you don’t like how the pore looks on your skin.
How do you fix a dilated pore of Winer?
Smaller dilated pores of Winer can simply be removed with tweezers and a comedone extractor tool that will empty the contents of the pore. When removing the dilated pore of Winer, cleaning out all the contents of the pore reduces the risk of it returning.
If you have a large dilated pore of Winer, don’t try to remove it at home! Your healthcare provider will remove your large, dilated pore of Winer by injecting a small amount of anesthetic near the pore and cutting the skin to remove the contents of the pore. Once the pore is empty, they will stitch the opening of the pore closed. Depending on the size of the pore, stitches are typically removed after 10 days when the wound heals.
How do I close a dilated pore of Winer?
Your healthcare provider will close large dilated pores of Winer with stitches after removing the contents of the pore. Small dilated pores of Winer, similar to the size of a traditional blackhead, should close on their own after squeezing the contents of the pore out with tweezers.
What medications treat a dilated pore of Winer?
Use prescribed antibiotics to treat an infected dilated pore of Winer. No other medications are needed for treatment.
Will my dilated pore of Winer return after removal?
It is likely that a dilated pore of Winer will return after removal if the contents of the pore were not entirely removed. To prevent this, use a skincare routine that cleans pores without clogging them (non-comedogenic).
How long does it take to recover from this treatment?
If your healthcare provider removes the dilated pore of Winer, it could take up to 10 days for the pore to heal.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a dilated pore of Winer?
You can remove a dilated pore of Winer if you don’t like how it looks on your skin, but it isn’t necessary since the pore doesn’t pose any threat to your health.

If your dilated pore of Winer is large, bothersome and you choose to get it removed by your healthcare provider, the likelihood that it will return depends on whether or not they removed the contents of the pore completely. A dilated pore of Winer will return if the pore is still clogged.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting a dilated pore of Winer?
Since the cause is unknown, there is not a method to prevent a dilated pore of Winer from appearing on your skin.
In order to prevent your pores from clogging, you can:
Use skincare products that don’t clog pores (non-comedogenic).
Use a cleanser when washing your skin to exfoliate.
Treat acne when it occurs (use benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to dry out dead skin cells).
Wear sunscreen.
