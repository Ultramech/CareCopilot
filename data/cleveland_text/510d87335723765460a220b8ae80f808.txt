In some cases, Sweet syndrome occurs with other medical conditions such as cancer, gastrointestinal infections, or pregnancy. Occasionally, Sweet syndrome results when people use certain medications. These include some antibiotics, like co-trimoxazole (Bactrim™), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like Advil®.
Treatment for Sweet syndrome involves corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, which are used to reduce inflammation. In most cases, medications reduce or get rid of symptoms. Treating the medical problem may resolve your symptoms if an underlying condition is causing Sweet syndrome.
How common is Sweet syndrome?
Sweet syndrome is a rare medical condition. To date, several hundred cases have been reported.
Who is most at risk for getting Sweet syndrome?
Anyone can develop Sweet syndrome. Most people living with this condition are women between the ages of 30 and 50.
What complications are associated with Sweet syndrome?
In some cases, Sweet syndrome affects other organ systems in the body, like your nervous and gastrointestinal systems. Most commonly, eye problems occur. These may include eye inflammation, increased eye pressure (
glaucoma
), and corneal ulceration, or sores on your cornea.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes Sweet syndrome?
The cause of Sweet syndrome is unknown. Doctors use three categories to classify Sweet syndrome:
Classical:
The disorder occurs with other medical conditions like upper respiratory infections, pregnancy, or gastrointestinal infections.
Malignancy-associated:
Sweet syndrome appears with certain types of cancer, like acute myeloid leukemia.
Drug-induced:
Certain medications trigger Sweet syndrome. These include some antibiotics, like Bactrim, NSAIDS and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which stimulates your body to make neutrophils, a type of immune system cell.

What are the symptoms of Sweet syndrome?
The symptoms of Sweet syndrome come on suddenly. They include:
Painful bumps or small blisters filled with pus on the face, neck, arms, or legs
Skin and mouth lesions (sores or tumors)
Skin discoloration
Fever
Muscle
and joint pain,
headache
, and fatigue
General feeling of being unwell
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Sweet syndrome diagnosed?
Your doctor diagnoses Sweet syndrome by performing a thorough physical examination. Doctors may perform a
skin biopsy
if they can’t make a diagnosis after a physical exam. For a biopsy, your doctor takes a skin tissue sample and sends it to a laboratory for further evaluation. Other diagnostic information includes fever higher than 100.4, good response to steroids, history of concurrent malignancy, sickness, pregnancy and abnormal inflammatory blood markers.
Management and Treatment
How is Sweet syndrome treated?
Occasionally, Sweet syndrome resolves on its own without any medical treatment. For most people, treatment involves systemic (whole body) corticosteroid medications, like prednisone. These medications reduce inflammation and curb immune system activity. Corticosteroids prevent tissue damage by lowering levels of white blood cells and other parts of your immune system that fight infections.
If Sweet syndrome has an underlying cause, you’ll receive treatment for the underlying condition. Stopping the medications that cause symptoms can relieve drug-induced Sweet syndrome.
What should I expect after treatment for Sweet syndrome?
For most people, the rash and skin lesions caused by Sweet syndrome heal without scarring. Your skin may remain discolored for several months after symptoms disappear.

Prevention
Can Sweet syndrome be prevented?
