Meniscus Surgery
Meniscus surgery is an operation that treats a torn meniscus. The surgery requires a few small incisions and takes about an hour. Recovery ranges from a few weeks to a few months (depending on which type of surgery you need). The procedure can reduce pain, improve mobility and stability, and get you back to your usual activities.

Overview
During a meniscus repair, a surgeon will stitch the tear in your meniscus so it heals back into one piece.
What is meniscus surgery?
Meniscus surgery is an operation to treat a
torn meniscus
(damage inside your knee). An
orthopaedic surgeon
will either repair or remove the damaged portion of your meniscus.

Policy
A healthcare provider may recommend meniscus surgery if you have a serious (high-grade) torn meniscus or if nonsurgical treatments haven’t managed the symptoms you’re experiencing.
Many people with a torn meniscus choose surgery because the injured cartilage can make their knee unstable (buckle and give way), cause pain and swelling, or make their knee to “lock up” or become “stuck.”
Treatment Details
How should I prepare for meniscus surgery?
You’ll need some or all of the following tests before your meniscus surgery:
Physical exam
.
Blood tests
.
EKG
.
Chest X-ray
.
Knee X-ray
.
MRI
.
Tell your provider and surgeon what medications and over-the-counter (OTC) or herbal supplements you take. You may have to stop taking some prescriptions or supplements before your surgery.
Your surgeon will tell you when you should fast (stop eating and drinking) the day before your surgery. Most people need to fast for 12 hours before their surgery.
Plan to arrange transportation to and from your surgery. You won’t be able to drive yourself home after surgery, so make sure someone’s available to pick you up.
What happens during meniscus surgery?
The day of your surgery, an
anesthesiologist
will give you
anesthesia
to numb your body and make sure you don’t feel pain during the procedure. They’ll give you either general anesthesia that puts you to sleep or regional anesthesia that numbs you from the waist down. If you need regional anesthesia, your anesthesiologist will also give you a
sedative
to relax you.

Meniscus surgery is usually done with a minimally invasive
knee arthroscopy
. Your surgeon will make a few cuts (incisions) in the skin around your knee. They’ll insert tiny tools and a small camera into your knee joint to treat the meniscus tear. There are three types of meniscus surgery:
Meniscus repair.
Partial meniscectomy.
Meniscus replacement.
Meniscus repair
A meniscus repair is just what it sounds like — your surgeon will repair the tear and any other damage in your meniscus. They’ll stitch (suture) the tear together so your meniscus heals back into one piece. Your body will absorb the sutures as the tear heals.
Partial meniscectomy
A “partial meniscectomy” is the medical term for removing the damaged part of your meniscus. Your surgeon will trim the damaged cartilage away from your meniscus and leave healthy tissue in place.
Meniscectomy is a good option for more severe tears. Higher-grade meniscus tears usually are too severe to heal back together completely, even with a repair.
Meniscus replacement
Meniscus replacement
(meniscus transplantation) is much less common than the other two types. It’s usually only a good option for people younger than 50 who have knee arthritis or a severely torn meniscus. Your surgeon will replace your meniscus with an allograft (a meniscus from a human donor).
How long does meniscus surgery take?
Meniscus surgery usually takes around an hour. It might take a little more or less time depending on which type of surgery you need, the severity of the tear and if you have any other injuries (like
knee ligament
tears) that need treatment, too.
What happens after meniscus surgery?
Meniscus surgery is usually an outpatient procedure. That means you can go home the same day. Your surgery team will monitor you in a recovery room while the anesthesia wears off. When it’s safe for you to go home, you’ll need someone to drive you.

Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of meniscus surgery?
Meniscus surgery can help:
Get you back to sports or other physical activities.
Improve your mobility.
Make your knee more stable.
Reduce or completely relieve pain and other symptoms of a torn meniscus.
What are the complications of meniscus surgery?
Meniscus surgery is safe and effective, but it does have a risk of some complications, including:
Blood clots
.
Bleeding inside your knee.
Infections.
Nerve damage (
neuropathy
) or
blood vessel
damage.
Stiffness in your knee joint, even after you recover.
Having meniscus surgery can increase your risk of
knee arthritis
in that knee later in life, especially if you have a partial meniscectomy. You can safely use your knee without your whole meniscus, but having a section removed during a partial meniscectomy can increase stress and friction inside that knee for the rest of your life.

Talk to your surgeon about your risk of complications. For most people, the benefits of treating the torn meniscus and the symptoms it causes outweigh the risks.
Recovery and Outlook
How long does it take to recover and recuperate after meniscus surgery?
Full recovery from meniscus surgery usually takes somewhere from a few weeks, up to a few months. Meniscus repairs take longer to heal than meniscectomy. Meniscus replacement has the longest recovery timeline. Your surgeon will tell you what to expect and give you a specific recovery timeline based on your unique situation and needs.
Meniscectomies usually take around six weeks to recover. Meniscus repairs take longer because, in addition to healing from the surgery itself, you have to wait for your meniscus to heal inside your knee. This can take up to three months, depending on how quickly your body naturally heals. It takes several months for a meniscus replacement to heal. You might need to avoid intense physical activities (like playing sports) for up to a year.
After surgery, you’ll need:
Crutches
.
A
knee brace
to stabilize the joint.
Pain medications.
To follow the
RICE method
(rest, ice, compression and elevation).
Physical therapy (PT)
. Your
physical therapist
will also give you at-home exercises at home to restore mobility, range of motion and strength. You’ll need PT for several months after a meniscus repair. Because recovery after a meniscectomy is shorter, you may only need PT for several weeks.

How long after meniscus surgery can I walk again?
You should be able to put some weight on your knee right away after a meniscectomy. You’ll probably have to wait a few weeks before you resume walking and light physical activity. It may be around a month before it’s safe for you to resume intense physical activities.
It will take a little longer to resume walking and other activities after a meniscus repair or replacement. You’ll need crutches for at least a few weeks to take stress off your knee while you’re standing and moving. Once you can walk without crutches, it’ll be a few more weeks before you can do light activities without support. It might be a few months before your surgeon clears you to resume intense physical activities.
How painful is meniscus repair surgery?
You’ll feel some pain immediately after surgery and for several weeks as your body heals. This is normal.
Your surgeon will suggest a combination of prescription pain medication, over-the-counter
NSAIDs
(if it’s safe for you to take them) and acetaminophen to relieve your pain. Your surgeon will tell you how much of each kind of medication you can take each day or in a certain amount of time.
Talk to your surgeon if you feel like you’re experiencing too much pain or if you’re worried about any complications from taking pain medication.

Will my knee ever be the same after meniscus surgery?
Most people are able to return to all their usual activities (including playing sports) after they recover from meniscus surgery. Your surgeon and physical therapist will tell you when it’s OK to resume walking without crutches or wearing a brace. Don’t resume more intense physical activities before your surgeon says it’s safe.
Some people who experience an injury like a meniscus tear need time to trust their body again, even after they’ve physically recovered. Your brain might have nagging thoughts about the injury, especially if it happened at work or because of a
sports injury
. This is common. Talk to your surgeon or physical therapist about what you’re feeling. They’ll help you regain your confidence while you’re getting back in the groove of your usual routine.
Tell your surgeon or regular healthcare provider if you’re feeling
knee pain
in that knee in the future.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Your surgeon will tell you when you’ll need follow-up appointments during your recovery. But you should call them right away if you notice:
Fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
Lots of drainage (blood or fluid) from your surgery site.
Pus or foul-smelling drainage from your surgery site.
Pain or swelling that doesn’t get better after resting or elevating your knee.
Trouble breathing.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Having surgery to treat a torn meniscus may seem scary. But it’s a safe, effective way to fix the damage inside your knee and get you up and moving again. You’ll have to miss some games, practices or training sessions. And you’ll have to learn to trust your knee and body again. This can take time, and it’s normal to be nervous when you resume your usual activities.
Talk to your provider, surgeon or physical therapist. Your care team is there to help you feel confident and strong on your knee, no matter which type of meniscus surgery you need.
