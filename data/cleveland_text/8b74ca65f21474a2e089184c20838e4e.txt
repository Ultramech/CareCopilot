Overview
What is anomic aphasia?
Anomic aphasia is a language disorder where you have trouble finding the correct word to say or write down. It may feel like the word is on the tip of your tongue. Your speech is fluent, and your sentences are grammatically correct, but you may stumble on nouns and verbs. Using general, vague words may be easier than naming a specific object. This can make short sentences long-winded, and you may lose the message you’re trying to convey.

For example, you may be thinking of an apple, but you can’t get the word “apple” out. You might instead say, “the… uh… red thing that grows on trees” or “the stuff you put in a pie.”
While the person you’re talking to may be able to figure out what you’re saying using context clues (pulling other information in from your conversation to understand the meaning of a word), you may feel frustrated that you can’t find the right word or say what you want to say quickly and clearly.
You might think that your symptoms mean you’re forgetful or lack intelligence, but that’s not the case. Anomic aphasia doesn’t affect your intelligence.
Anomic aphasia is a common and mild form of
aphasia
. You may hear your healthcare provider refer to anomic aphasia as anomia, amnesic aphasia or nominal aphasia.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of anomic aphasia?
The main symptom of anomic aphasia is difficulty finding the right words. You know what to say, but you can’t say it or write it down. The most troublesome words are nouns (objects, places or people) and verbs (words describing actions). This can cause:
Pauses in speech.
Fumbling over a word.
Describing the word instead of naming it.
Substituting the word you’re looking for with a general term like “stuff” or “things.”

Usually after a moment or two, you’ll be able to retrieve the word and say it. Word retrieval often happens after a conversation is over.
The trouble you have finding the right word can make conversations very difficult and frustrating. It can lead to social isolation and
depression
.
What causes anomic aphasia?
Brain damage to the language processing center of your brain causes anomic aphasia. The most common cause of brain damage to this area is a
stroke
.
Other causes may include:
Brain tumors
.
Traumatic brain injuries
(TBIs).
Brain infections.
A
neurodegenerative condition
like
Alzheimer’s disease
.
What part of my brain does anomic aphasia affect?
Anomic aphasia affects the left hemisphere (side) of your
brain
. Specifically, your left
temporal
and
parietal lobes
. These areas of your brain regulate what you say and how you say it.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is anomic aphasia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose anomic aphasia after a
physical exam
,
neurological exam
and testing. During the exam, they’ll learn more about your health history and symptoms.
There isn’t a specific test to diagnose anomic aphasia, but tests can rule out conditions with similar symptoms.
Your physician may refer you to see a
speech-language pathologist
(SLP) who will assess your language skills. A speech-language pathologist will perform a comprehensive language evaluation. This is a broad test to learn more about your ability to name objects, repeat phrases, read and write.
Your provider may also order imaging tests like an
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) or
CT scan
(computed tomography scan) to locate damage in the language processing area of your brain.
Management and Treatment
Is there a cure for anomic aphasia?
There isn’t a cure available for anomic aphasia. Many people who experienced a stroke see object naming improvements days to weeks after the event. But 30% to 40% of stroke survivors experience persistent anomic aphasia symptoms. Treatment options can address chronic forms of anomic aphasia.
How is anomic aphasia treated?
Speech therapy
is the treatment of choice for anomic aphasia. Speech therapy can help you improve your word retrieval and communication skills. During therapy, you’ll learn different methods to find a word you’re trying to say or alternative ways of communicating. Therapy is unique to each person to address your needs, specifically.
Outside of speech therapy, you can practice your learned skills in real-world scenarios like ordering a meal at a restaurant or having a conversation with a friend when you’re ready. Practicing what you learn in speech therapy outside of your session benefits your language fluency (your ability to put words together in a sentence) and accuracy (your ability to choose the right words for each sentence).

In addition, treating the underlying cause of anomic aphasia can improve symptoms. For example, your provider may recommend taking medications to address an infection or condition like Alzheimer’s disease.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have anomic aphasia?
Anomic aphasia can happen suddenly after an event like a stroke or injury, or it can slowly develop as you age. Many cases improve over time, but some cases won’t go away completely or need lifelong management. Your recovery varies based on what caused anomia symptoms and the extent of brain damage.
Speech therapy may help you find the words you need in a conversation or introduce you to alternative communication methods.
Brain stimulation activities
, like puzzles or games, might also be helpful. You can download brain training apps on your smartphone or other devices. These keep your brain active and can contribute to your overall language retention.
Prevention
Can anomic aphasia be prevented?
It’s not possible to prevent all cases of anomic aphasia. You can reduce your risk of brain damage that may lead to aphasia by managing any underlying health conditions and wearing personal protective equipment during high-risk activities.

When should I see a healthcare provider?
Visit a healthcare provider if you’re unable to identify objects or feel like you can’t say the word you’re thinking about. You may feel like you’re just forgetful and can’t remember what word you’re looking for, but many times, there’s an underlying reason for your symptoms. A healthcare provider can determine what’s causing your symptoms and offer treatment if necessary.

What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
You may want to ask your provider:
Will my language retrieval skills improve?
When will I regain language retrieval skills?
How often should I participate in speech therapy?
What can I do at home to keep my brain active?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Anomic aphasia is a frustrating condition to manage. You simply want to talk to someone, but the right words don’t come out. You may have to be vague or over-describe something. This can turn conversations into a game of charades.
If the words don’t come naturally, let a healthcare provider know. There may be an underlying cause to your symptoms that’s more than being forgetful. Treatment options are available so you can better communicate your wants and needs.
