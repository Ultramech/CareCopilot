Treatment Details
How long should I use an over-the-counter NSAID?
Don’t use an over-the-counter NSAID continuously for more than three days for fever and 10 days for pain unless your provider says it’s OK. Over-the-counter NSAIDs work well for relieving pain, but you should only use them short term.
If your provider clears you to take NSAIDs for a long period of time, you should keep an eye out for harmful side effects like stomach pain or
heartburn
. If you develop side effects, your provider can recommend an alternative treatment.

Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of NSAIDs?
NSAIDs are very effective for:
Reducing inflammation.
Easing pain.
Decreasing stiffness.
Reducing fever.
What are the risks of NSAIDs?
Some people develop stomach ulcers from taking NSAIDs. To reduce your risk of ulcers, always take NSAIDs with food (preferably, a full meal).
While NSAIDs are effective for relieving symptoms, they don’t help your body heal. In fact, research suggests that these medications can actually slow your body’s natural healing process. A healthcare provider can help you weigh the risks and benefits of using NSAIDs and find a treatment that’s right for you.
Who should avoid NSAIDs?
In general, you should avoid taking NSAIDs if you have:
Stomach ulcers
or
gastrointestinal bleeding
.
Kidney disease
.
Liver disease
.
GERD (chronic acid reflux)
.
Crohn’s disease
.
Ulcerative colitis
.
Unmanaged
diabetes
.
High blood pressure
that’s difficult to manage.
Bleeding disorders
.
Heart failure.
A history of
stroke
or
heart attack
.
You also shouldn’t take NSAIDs if you’re pregnant or plan on getting pregnant.
Additionally, if any of the following apply to you, check with your provider before taking NSAIDs:

viral infections
(with or without fever) shouldn’t take aspirin or aspirin-containing products due to the risk of

(a rare but deadly illness that can affect their
brain
and
liver
).
Those who have an upcoming surgical procedure, including
oral surgery
.
People who have beverages containing alcohol every day.
Asthma
that gets worse when taking aspirin.
If you’re 65 or older.
What are some common NSAID side effects?
You may develop side effects if you take large doses of NSAIDs, or if you take them for a long time. Some side effects are mild and go away, while others are more serious and need medical attention.
Unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so, don't take:
Over-the-counter NSAIDs with prescription NSAIDs.
Multiple over-the-counter NSAIDs.
More than the recommended dose of NSAIDs.
Doing so could increase your risk of side effects.

Additional Common Questions
Is Tylenol (acetaminophen) an NSAID?
No,
acetaminophen
isn’t an NSAID. It relieves pain and reduces fever. But unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen (like Tylenol®) doesn’t reduce inflammation.
Acetaminophen doesn’t cause as many gastrointestinal issues as NSAIDs, though. So, if you’re prone to stomach issues, acetaminophen might be a better option for you. Check with your provider if you have questions about what kind to take.
Can NSAIDs cause allergic reactions?
It’s rare, but NSAIDs can cause a generalized allergic reaction known as
anaphylactic shock
. If this happens, it’s usually soon after you start taking the NSAID. The symptoms of this reaction include:
Swollen eyes, lips or tongue.
Difficulty swallowing.
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
.
Rapid heart rate.
Chest pain or tightness.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
When your back aches, your head hurts,
arthritis
acts up or you’re feeling feverish, an NSAID can give you the quick relief you need. They’re safe when used correctly. But it’s not a good idea to take them if you have certain health conditions. Ask your healthcare provider if NSAIDs are right for you.
