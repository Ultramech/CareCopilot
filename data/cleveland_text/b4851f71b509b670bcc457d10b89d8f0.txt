Campylobacter Infection
A Campylobacter infection (campylobacteriosis) is one of the most common causes of diarrhea. It’s a bacterial infection you can get from undercooked poultry, raw milk and untreated water. It’s also possible to get sick from contact with infected animals. Most people recover without treatment in about a week.

What Is A Campylobacter Infection?
A
Campylobacter
infection (campylobacteriosis) is a common stomach bug. It occurs when
Campylobacter
bacteria
get into your system and make you sick. You usually get it from something you eat or drink. The infection causes:

Diarrhea
Stomach
cramping
Vomiting
Fever
Many people call this infection
food poisoning
. But the bacteria can also spread in other ways, like through contact with an infected animal. Most people feel sick for about five to seven days. But they recover just fine without treatment. To care for yourself at home, rest and drink plenty of fluids to prevent
dehydration
.
How common are
Campylobacter
infections?
Campylobacter
infections are very common among children and adults. They’re one of the top causes of diarrhea among people of all ages in the U.S. and globally.
Researchers estimate about
1.5 million
Campylobacter
infections occur each year in the U.S. They’re more common in the summer than in the winter.
Symptoms and Causes
Campylobacter
symptoms
Campylobacteriosis symptoms include:
Diarrhea that may contain
blood
(this may be the only symptom in infants)
Stomach cramping
Fever
Nausea
and
vomiting
You’ll notice symptoms about two to five days
after you’re exposed
to the bacteria. They’ll last for about a week.
Stomach bugs like
Campylobacter
can quickly lead to dehydration.
Signs of dehydration
to look out for in older children and adults include:
Feeling very thirsty
Not peeing often
Skin that’s warm to the touch
Signs of dehydration in babies and toddlers include:

Peeing less than normal
Fewer or no tears when
crying
Lack of interest in playing
Excessive sleepiness
What causes a
Campylobacter
infection?
Campylobacter
bacteria cause this type of
infection
. These bacteria are the
germs
that make you sick. People call
Campylobacter
a stomach bug because a germ infects you. But it’s not quite the same as
stomach flu
. Still, many people use the terms interchangeably, and the symptoms are similar.
Is
Campylobacter
a virus?
No,
Campylobacter
is a bacterial infection, not a
virus
.
What is
Campylobacter
jejuni
?
Campylobacter jejuni
(
C. jejuni
) is the species of
Campylobacter
bacteria that’s most likely to make you sick.
When you’re stuck in the bathroom, you’re not thinking about which germ caused it. You just want to get better. But scientists keep track of the types of germs that cause different illnesses, including bacterial infections and
viral infections
. With
Campylobacter
infections, the culprits come from the
Campylobacter
genus of bacteria. A genus is a big category that contains many different species.
There are more than 20
Campylobacter
species, but not all of them can make you sick. The species that causes the most
Campylobacter
infections in humans is
C. jejuni
. The next most common is
Campylobacter coli
(
C. coli
).
How do you get a
Campylobacter
infection?
Campylobacter
bacteria spread to humans mostly through contaminated food and water. But they can also spread in other ways. Most people get sick from:
Drinking unpasteurized (raw) milk
.
Bacteria can enter the milk through trace amounts of manure or when a cow has an udder infection.
Eating poultry that’s not fully cooked
. This includes chicken, turkey, duck and goose.
Drinking untreated water
.
For instance, if you drink water from contaminated streams or wells.
Though less common, you can also get a
Campylobacter
infection from:
Eating food that’s touched raw poultry or its juices, like lettuce prepared on a cutting board that contains traces of raw chicken juice
Eating other types of meat or seafood that aren’t fully cooked
Eating contaminated fruits or veggies
Contact with the poop of infected animals, including pets
Is
Campylobacter
contagious?
Yes, it’s possible for you to spread the infection to others. The bacteria live in your poop. From there, they can spread from your hands to other people. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, they might get sick. But transmission between humans doesn’t happen as often as other methods (like eating undercooked poultry).
To avoid spreading
Campylobacter
,
wash your hands
well after using the bathroom.

When can people with
Campylobacter
return to work or school?
It’s generally safe to return once the diarrhea goes away and your poop becomes solid. But your healthcare provider is the best person to ask about how soon you or your child can return to normal activities. If you handle food or work in healthcare, you may need to stay home until all your symptoms are gone to avoid the risk of getting others sick.
Complications of this condition
Campylobacter
infections may lead to complications like:
Irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS)
Reactive arthritis
Guillain-Barré syndrome
(rare)
People who have a
weakened immune system
may have more serious complications, like a
bloodstream infection
. This can lead to a dangerous immune reaction called sepsis.
Sepsis
is a medical emergency. Go to an emergency room immediately if you develop
:
A fever over 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius)
Confusion
or disorientation
Fast heart rate
Shortness of breath
Extreme
pain
or discomfort
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose
Campylobacter
infections
The most common test to find a
Campylobacter
infection is a
stool (poop) test
. Your healthcare provider sends a sample of your poop to a lab. There, technicians test it for bacteria.
Rarely, providers need to order a
blood test
to check if the bacteria have spread to your blood.
Management and Treatment
How are
Campylobacter
infections treated?
Most people don’t need treatment for a
Campylobacter
infection. It just has to run its course.
That takes about one week
. You can help avoid dehydration by:
Advertisement
Drinking plenty of fluids
Replenishing your
electrolytes
, possibly with a sports drink
Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe
antibiotics
for people at risk of getting very sick. These include people who:
Are over age 65
Are
pregnant
Have a weakened immune system
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Most people recover fine without the need for medical care. Call your provider if you’re pregnant, over age 65 or have a weakened immune system. They’ll talk to you about your risk for complications. They’ll let you know if you need treatment. You should also call your provider if you feel like you’re not getting better after about a week.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a
Campylobacter
infection?
A
Campylobacter
infection can make you quite sick. But your symptoms should go away in five to seven days. Most people don’t have complications or long-term issues. If you develop complications, your healthcare provider will tell you what you can expect.
Prevention
How can I prevent a
Campylobacter
infection?
You can’t always prevent infections like
Campylobacter
. But there’s a lot you can do to lower your risk. Here are some simple steps you can take in your daily life to help keep your family healthy:
Be careful in the kitchen
. Following
food safety guidelines
can greatly lower your risk of foodborne illness. It’s especially important to take care when
handling raw meat
. Research shows
Campylobacter
commonly live on raw poultry (like chicken, turkey and duck). Even one drop of raw poultry juice can make you sick.
Thoroughly cook meat and seafood
. Cooking meat to the
proper temperature
can kill
Campylobacter
and other bacteria that could cause illness. Use caution when
consuming raw fish
. But avoid it completely if you’re pregnant, over age 65 or have a weakened immune system.
Choose pasteurized dairy
. Unpasteurized (raw) milk is a leading cause of
Campylobacter
infections. Other products, like soft
cheeses
, might also contain unpasteurized milk even if it’s not as obvious. Read the
labels
on dairy products. Look for the word “pasteurized” to know they’re safe.
Drink clean water
.
Campylobacter
and other bacteria can easily contaminate water, even if it looks clean. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for public water safety. But if you drink
well water
, you need to make sure it’s free of bacteria and other germs. Ask your provider how to avoid contaminated water
when traveling
.
Wash your hands
.
Campylobacter
is a germ. Germs love to hang out on your hands. From there, it’s just a short journey to your eyes, nose or mouth. Then, they can enter your body and make you sick. Good hand hygiene can protect you and others. This includes washing your hands before preparing food,
after using the bathroom
and after changing a baby’s diaper.

Preventing
Campylobacter
when you have a pet
Furry family members can spread germs just like humans do. Cats, dogs and other common pets sometimes carry
Campylobacter
bacteria. You can avoid getting sick by washing your hands after you:
Touch your pet
Touch their food, water, bed or toys
Clean up their poop, pee or throw up
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It comes out of nowhere. One minute, you’re feeling great and enjoying lunch. The next thing you know, you can barely make it to the bathroom in time. Most of us can remember such a time. We’ve accepted that stomach bugs are simply a miserable part of life we can’t avoid. But what if, sometimes, we can?
From avoiding raw milk to using a meat thermometer, you can greatly lower your risk of coming down with a
Campylobacter
infection. If you or your child is at risk for complications, it’s especially important to be careful. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help keep yourself and your family healthy.
