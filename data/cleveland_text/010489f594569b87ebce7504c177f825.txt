Overview
What is bacterial meningitis?
Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening type of
meningitis
. Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes (
meninges
) that surround and protect your brain and spinal cord. An infection of the fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation. Anyone experiencing symptoms of meningitis should seek medical care immediately. Bacterial meningitis can cause death within hours.

Viral vs. bacterial meningitis
Bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis both cause inflammation of your meninges.
Bacterial infections
cause bacterial meningitis and
viral infections
cause viral meningitis. Viral meningitis is more common but isn’t usually as serious as bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis can cause the tissues around your brain to swell. This in turn can interfere with blood flow and can result in paralysis, stroke and even death.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of bacterial meningitis?
Bacterial meningitis symptoms typically come on suddenly, often within 24 hours of exposure. Symptoms may include:
Fever
.
Headache
.
Inability to lower your chin to your chest due to a
stiff neck
.
Flu-like symptoms.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Photophobia
(sensitivity to light).
Confusion (altered mental status).
In older children and adults, symptoms may also include irritability and increasing
drowsiness
.
Seizures
and
stroke
may occur.
In babies and young children, fever may cause vomiting and they may refuse to eat. Other symptoms may include:
Sleepiness or trouble waking up.
Low energy or slower responses (
lethargy
).
Irritability.
Bulging fontanelle (“soft spot” on your baby’s head).
Seizures.
If you or your child has any of these symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911 right away. Bacterial meningitis can worsen quickly, leading to
coma
and even death within hours.

What bacteria cause meningitis?
About 50 different types of
bacteria
can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common bacteria include:
Group B
Streptococcus
.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (
pneumococcal
).
Neisseria meningitidis (
meningococcal
).
Haemophilus influenzae
.
Listeria monocytogenes
.
Escherichia coli (E. coli)
.
How do you get bacterial meningitis?
The bacteria most often responsible for bacterial meningitis are common in the environment. They can be in your nose and throat at any time without causing any harm. You may not get sick, but you can still spread the bacteria to other people who could get sick. You can spread the bacteria through close contact with someone else. The bacteria commonly spreads through respiratory secretions when you’re sneezing, coughing or kissing.
Is bacterial meningitis contagious?
Yes. If you’ve had bacterial meningitis, you should encourage anyone you’ve had close contact with to seek preventive treatment with antibiotics.
Who gets bacterial meningitis?
Children between the ages of 1 month and 2 years are the most susceptible to bacterial meningitis.
Adults with certain risk factors are also susceptible. You’re at higher risk if you have:
Substance use disorder
.
Chronic nose and/or
ear infections
.
A head injury.
Pneumococcal
pneumonia
.
A weakened
immune system
.
Had your
spleen
removed.
Sickle cell disease
.
Additionally, if you’ve had brain or spinal surgery or have had a widespread blood infection, you’re also at a higher risk for bacterial meningitis.
Outbreaks of bacterial meningitis also occur in living situations where you’re in close contact with others, such as college dormitories or military barracks.
What are the complications of bacterial meningitis?
If you don’t seek treatment immediately, bacterial meningitis can lead to
paralysis
, stroke and death. In people who survive, long-term complications can occur. These complications may include:
Seizures.
Memory and concentration issues.
Balance, coordination and movement problems.
Learning differences
.
Speech issues.
Vision or
hearing loss
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is bacterial meningitis diagnosed?
If you suspect you have meningitis, it’s important that you seek immediate medical assistance. A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam.
The provider may collect samples of your blood, urine or mucus. They’ll also perform a
lumbar puncture (spinal tap)
to collect a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord. A laboratory will test the samples to determine what’s causing your infection.
If your provider suspects meningitis, they’ll begin treatment right away, before the test results come back.

Management and Treatment
How is bacterial meningitis treated?
Healthcare providers treat bacterial meningitis with
antibiotics
. They’ll give you an IV (intravenous) antibiotic with a
corticosteroid
to bring down the inflammation even before all the test results are in. When the lab identifies the specific bacterium causing your condition, your provider may change to a different antibiotic.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have bacterial meningitis?
Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition. Between 10% and 15% of people who get the disease will die. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics lead to a better chance of recovery.
Prevention
Is there a bacterial meningitis vaccine?
Yes. Several vaccines protect against some of the bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis. These vaccines include:
Meningococcal
to protect against
N. meningitidis
.
Pneumococcal
to protect against
S. pneumoniae
.
Haemophilus influenzae type b
to protect against
H. influenzae
.
How else can I prevent bacterial meningitis?
If you’re pregnant, you should talk to your healthcare provider about group B
Streptococcus
testing during your 36th or 37th week of pregnancy. If you test positive, your provider can give you antibiotics during labor to prevent passing group B strep to your baby.
You can also prevent bacterial meningitis by maintaining healthy habits, including:
Quit smoking
.
Get plenty of sleep.
Stay away from people who are sick.
Wash your hands
frequently.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough.
