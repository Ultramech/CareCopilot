What Is Collagenous Colitis?
Collagenous colitis is an
inflammatory bowel disease
that causes chronic, watery diarrhea. It gets its name from the way it affects the
collagen
in your
colon
lining. Collagen is a protein that your body uses to build
connective tissues
. This is what the middle layer of your colon lining is made of. In collagenous colitis, this layer of collagen is abnormally swollen and thickened. This is only visible under a microscope.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are conditions that involve ongoing irritation inside your intestines. Symptoms may come and go and get better or worse, but they keep coming back. Collagenous colitis belongs to a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease called
microscopic colitis
. It won’t show up during a routine colonoscopy. To diagnose it, your provider will need to take
biopsies
and send them to a lab.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of collagenous colitis
The primary symptom of collagenous colitis is
chronic, watery diarrhea
. (It’s not bloody, like it can be with other types of colitis.) You may have to go many times in a day and may find it hard to hold in. You may also have
abdominal pain
or cramps with it. If it’s severe, you may get
dehydrated
or lose weight.
Some people with collagenous colitis also have symptoms of
inflammation
in other parts of their body.
These may include:
Joint pain
and stiffness
Skin rashes
or sores
Extreme tiredness (
fatigue
)
Stomach pain or digestive problems
Collagenous colitis causes
Researchers aren’t sure what causes collagenous colitis. Some think it might be an unidentified infection. Others believe it’s a type of
autoimmune disease
. This means your immune system produces inflammation by mistake. It acts like something is infecting or injuring your colon, even though it isn’t.

Researchers have suggested it may be a reaction to:
Infections that damage your colon lining, like
C. diff
and
Yersinia
Drugs that can injure your colon lining over time, like
NSAIDs
Allergens
in your colon, like pollen or foods
Risk factors
You may be more likely to be diagnosed with collagenous colitis if you:
Are
female
(the female-to-male ratio is 3:1)
Have a biological family member with inflammatory bowel disease
Have other gastrointestinal diseases, like
bile acid malabsorption
(BAM),
celiac disease
or
IBS
Have a whole-body (systemic) autoimmune disease, like
rheumatoid arthritis
or
scleroderma
Smoke
(smoking may increase your risk by
as much as five times
)
Take medications that can reduce your bowel immunity, like NSAIDs,
PPIs
or
SSRIs
Complications of collagenous colitis
The inflammation in collagenous colitis isn’t usually severe. So, it rarely leads to the kinds of complications that severe
colitis
can. The most likely complications are dehydration and weight loss from frequent diarrhea. Some people do develop other symptoms. But most improve with treatment.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose collagenous colitis
To diagnose collagenous colitis, your doctor must take several tissue samples from your colon lining. They’ll do this during a
colonoscopy
. Then, a
pathologist
will examine the samples under a microscope. They’ll recognize collagenous colitis if they see thickened collagen in one of your tissue samples.
Getting the right diagnosis can be a process. Many conditions can cause chronic diarrhea. And if you have more than one, their symptoms can complicate the picture. The wait can be frustrating, but stick with it. Your provider must suspect microscopic colitis before they can test for it.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for collagenous colitis?
Treatment for collagenous colitis may include:
Dietary changes
: Eliminating foods and drinks that trigger your diarrhea may help relieve it. These can vary. Common triggers include dairy, gluten, sweets, alcohol and caffeine.
Antidiarrheal medications
: For some people, over-the-counter (OTC) medications like
bismuth subsalicylate
or
psyllium
may relieve diarrhea. Your provider may also prescribe medications, like
loperamide
.
Anti-inflammatory drugs
: A short course of
corticosteroids
(usually
budesonide
) helps to bring down the inflammation. If that doesn’t work, your provider might prescribe
biologic DMARDs
.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for collagenous colitis?
With the right diagnosis and treatment, most people find relief from the symptoms of collagenous colitis. For some, the disease may go into remission, and all signs and symptoms may appear to go away. For others, it may reappear occasionally. You may need to take medications on and off for life.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Healthcare providers are still learning about collagenous colitis and how it may occur with other conditions. It can be very frustrating to have a condition that rules your life, and that your healthcare provider can’t diagnose. Fortunately, with the right diagnosis, collagenous colitis is treatable.
Once you know that you have collagenous colitis, you can expect your quality of life to improve. You might need to adjust your current medications or how you eat. And you might have to try a few new medications to find the right fit. With these simple changes, you should start to feel better soon.
