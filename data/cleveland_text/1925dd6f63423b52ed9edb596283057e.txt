Overview
Yellow tongue could be a result of smoking, poor oral hygiene or other causes. But it could also indicate an underlying health condition, such as autoimmune disorders.
Why is my tongue yellow?
Yellow tongue is a yellow discoloration of your
tongue
. In most cases, this condition is harmless and temporary. It usually happens when dead skin cells become trapped in your papillae (tiny, hair-like projections on your tongue). The dead skin cells accumulate on your papillae and become stained by things like food and tobacco.

What does a yellowish tongue mean?
A variety of factors may cause tongue discoloration. As mentioned above, it’s usually the result of dead skin cells that accumulate on your tongue. Rarely, a yellow coating on your tongue indicates underlying conditions, such as jaundice or certain autoimmune diseases.
Who does yellow tongue affect?
Anyone can develop yellow tongue. People who use tobacco products or take certain medications are more likely to have tongue discoloration.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes yellow tongue?
Yellow tongue may indicate a condition called
black hairy tongue
. This syndrome occurs when keratin, a protein, builds up on your tongue surface. This buildup gives your tongue a hairy appearance.
Other yellow tongue causes may include:
Poor oral hygiene.
Smoking
.
Chewing tobacco.
Overgrowth of bacteria on the surface of your tongue.
Certain foods.
Certain mouthwash ingredients, such as chlorhexidine, alcohol and menthol.
In some cases, yellow tongue indicates an underlying medical condition, such as:
Autoimmune diseases
. People with autoimmune diseases have weaker immune systems. If you have an autoimmune disorder, you’re more likely to develop yellow tongue.
Gastritis
. Inflammation of your stomach lining can lead to yellow tongue — particularly if the bacteria
Helicobacter pylori
caused the inflammation.
Psoriasis
. This condition causes flaky, scaly skin. It may also result in yellow patches on your tongue surface.
Jaundice
. Rarely, yellow tongue is a symptom of an underlying condition called jaundice. If you have jaundice, a yellow chemical compound called bilirubin builds up in your blood. It can cause yellow skin (including the skin on your tongue) and a yellowing of the whites of your eyes. This buildup may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for people with yellow tongue?

Can I prevent yellow tongue?
Proper oral hygiene is the best way to prevent yellow tongue. For best results, you should:

Floss between your teeth once daily using dental floss or interproximal brushes.
Use your toothbrush or a tongue scraper to remove dead skin cells and bacteria from the surface of your tongue.

Visit your dentist for routine exams and cleanings (every six months or according to the schedule your dentist recommends).
If you smoke, talk to your healthcare provider about ways to stop.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

They can find out why you developed yellow tongue and recommend appropriate treatment.
