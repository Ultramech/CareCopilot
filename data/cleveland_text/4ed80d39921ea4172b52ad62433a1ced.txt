Overview
What is swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis)?
Swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis) is a temporary, non-contagious itchy
rash
that appears on your skin and is caused by a certain parasite found in fresh water (lake or pond water) or salt water (ocean water). If you swim in water that’s infested with the parasite, it can burrow (dig) into your skin. Your body has an allergic reaction to it, causing a rash. The parasites cannot survive in human skin, so they die shortly after burrowing into your skin. The rash usually gets better after a few days, but it can last for up to two weeks.

What kind of parasites cause swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis)?
The parasite larvae that cause swimmer’s itch are known as cercariae. The parasites that cause swimmer’s itch originate from infected birds that live near water, such as ducks, geese and gulls, and mammals like beavers, muskrats and raccoons. The parasites lay eggs in the infected animal’s blood and then the eggs are passed through the infected animal’s poop.
If those eggs reach water, they hatch and release tiny, microscopic larvae. These larvae swim around the water looking for a certain species of snail, and if they come into contact with the snail, the larvae will multiply and further develop. Infected snails then release a different kind of larvae known as cercariae, which is why swimmer’s itch is called cercarial dermatitis. This kind of larvae then swims to the surface of the water looking for certain birds or mammals to continue the cycle.
Even though the larvae cannot survive in a human’s body, they can burrow into a swimmer’s skin and trigger an allergic reaction that causes an itchy rash, known as swimmer’s itch. The larvae soon die after they burrow into a person’s skin, but the itching and rash from the allergic reaction can last for several days.
What does swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis) look like?
Swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis) looks like a
rash
with reddish bumps or pimples. It may also cause small blisters on the skin and itch or burn. Swimmer’s itch can only appear on skin that has had contact with infested water.

How common is swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis)?
Swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis) is a common condition. It happens around the world and is more frequent in summer months when people are more likely to swim. Getting swimmer’s itch from fresh water, like lakes and ponds, is more common than getting it from salt water (the ocean).
Who gets swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis)?
Swimmer’s itch can happen to anyone who swims in water that is infested with the parasites that cause swimmer’s itch. Young children are more likely to get swimmer’s itch because they are more likely to wade and play in shallow water where the parasites are more likely to be found.
Where on my body can I get swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis)?
You can get swimmer’s itch on your body anywhere that the parasites from the infested water have come into contact. The legs are a common area to get swimmer’s itch since they are the part of your body that is most likely to be in the water, whether you are walking, wading or swimming in it.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis)?

Rinse off with clean water after swimming
: Rinse your body with clean water right after you’re done swimming. Be sure to dry your skin well with a clean towel.
Choose where you swim carefully
: Look for signs near the swimming site that could warn you of possible swimmer’s itch contamination and try not to swim in places where swimmer’s itch is a known or common problem.
Do not feed birds or animals near where you are swimming
: Birds and mammals that live near fresh water or salt water can carry the parasite that causes swimmer’s itch. You don’t want to make them come closer to areas where people are swimming, because they could spread the parasites.
Do not swim or wade in or near marshy areas:
Snails are more likely to be found in marshy areas, and they can be infected with the parasite that causes swimmer’s itch.
If possible, try not to swim or wade in shallow water
or by the shoreline
: The parasites that cause swimmer’s itch are more likely to be found in shallow water or by the shoreline. If you’re a strong swimmer, consider swimming in deeper water to try to avoid the parasites.

Additional Common Questions
Can I get swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis) from my swimming pool?
You can't get swimmer’s itch from pools that are well maintained and treated with chlorine.
Can swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis) spread to other parts of my body?
Swimmer’s itch can only develop on areas of your body that have been in contact with water that is infested with the parasite that causes it. Because of this, it does not spread from the original area of the allergic reaction. However, if you have swam in infested water more than once within the same day or within a couple days, you could have more than one swimmer’s itch rash on your body.
Once water is infested with swimmer’s itch (cercarial dermatitis), will it always be infested?
No. A lot of factors contribute to swimmer’s itch becoming a problem in fresh or salt water since certain birds or mammals and snails all need to be present. Since these factors can change, swimmer’s itch may not permanently be a problem at a swimming place that has been infested with the parasites. However, there is no way to know how long the water may be infested and unsafe. Always look for signage that warns of possible swimmer’s itch contamination before you swim in fresh or salt water.

A Note from Cleveland Clinic:
Swimmer’s itch can be really uncomfortable and itchy, but the rash itself is harmless and will eventually go away. Try your best not to scratch your rash too much or too hard, because it could cause the rash to become infected. Use at-home remedies such as anti-itch lotion or a cold compress to relieve the itchiness. It is important to remember that swimmer’s itch is not the only kind of
rash
that can result from swimming in fresh or salt water. Be sure to contact your healthcare provider if your rash lasts longer than two weeks or if there is pus coming out of your blisters.
