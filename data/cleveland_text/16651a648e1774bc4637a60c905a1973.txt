Dental Implants
Dental implants are a common surgical tooth replacement option. They provide support for artificial teeth like crowns, bridges and dentures. Dental implant placement may require a few procedures and several months of healing. But once an implant heals, you can use it just like a natural tooth. With proper care, your implant can last a lifetime.

Overview
A dental implant replaces a missing tooth root. Once the implant heals, your dentist can restore it with an artificial tooth.
What are dental implants?
Dental implants are small, threaded posts that surgically replace missing
teeth
. In addition to filling in gaps in your smile, dental implants improve chewing function and overall oral health. Once healed, implants work much like natural teeth.

A dental implant has three main parts:
Threaded post
: You can think of this like an artificial tooth root. A provider places it in your jawbone during an
oral surgery
procedure.
Abutment
: This is a tiny connector post. It screws into the threaded post and extends slightly beyond your
gums
. It serves as the foundation for your new artificial tooth.
Restoration
: A
dental restoration
is any prosthetic that repairs or replaces teeth. Common dental implant restorations are
crowns
,
bridges
and dentures.
Most dental implants are titanium, but some are ceramic. Both materials are safe and biocompatible (friendly to the tissues inside of your
mouth
).
Missing teeth can take a toll on your oral health. But it also impacts your mental and emotional well-being. Do you avoid social situations? Or cover your mouth when you laugh? Do you rarely smile for photos? Dental implants can restore your smile and your confidence, so you don’t have to miss out on the things you enjoy.
What conditions are treated with dental implants?
Dental implants treat
tooth loss
, which can happen due to:
Cavities
.
Cracked teeth
.
Gum disease
.
Teeth that never develop (
anodontia
).
Teeth grinding or clenching (
bruxism
).
How common are dental implants?
Dental implants are a popular choice for tooth replacement. In the United States, dental providers place over 3 million implants each year.

Treatment Details
What is the process of getting a dental implant?
Dental implant surgery is a personalized process. It’s not the same for everyone. But the following gives a general overview of what you can expect your
dentist
,
oral surgeon
,
periodontist
or
prosthodontist
to do:
Place the implant surgically.
Give you time to heal.
Attach the post and final crown, bridge or denture.
Dental implant surgery
During dental implant surgery, your surgeon will:
Give you
anesthesia
. This medication will numb your gums. If you choose
sedation
, your provider will give you those medications, as well.
Create an incision.
Your surgeon will make an incision (cut) in your gums. This exposes the
bone
underneath so your surgeon can place the implant.
Prepare your jaw.
Your surgeon will use a series of specialized instruments to create a small hole in your jawbone. They’ll widen the opening until it’s just the right size for your new dental implant.
Place the dental implant.
Next, your surgeon will carefully place the dental implant into your jaw.
Close the incisions.
Finally, your surgeon will reposition your gums and close the incision with stitches.
If your implant is near the front of your mouth, your dentist will make a temporary tooth for you to wear until you heal. That way, you won’t have a gap in your smile while you recover. If your implant is near the back of your mouth, you probably won’t need a temporary tooth. Your provider can tell you what to expect in your situation.
Healing phase (osseointegration)
During the healing phase, your jawbone should fuse to the dental implant. This process, called osseointegration, is critical for stability and long-term success. This process can take anywhere from three to nine months. In some cases, it may take longer. It depends on how quickly your body heals.
Placement of abutment and final restoration
Once your implant heals, your dentist can attach the abutment (small connector post) and your final restoration (crown, bridge or denture). This usually takes about one hour to complete and may require a second minor surgery.
How painful is getting a dental implant?
You shouldn’t feel any pain during your dental implant procedure because your provider will use medication to numb your gums. After your surgery, it’s normal to have slight discomfort and swelling. Over-the-counter (OTC)
pain relievers
can help ease these symptoms.

Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of dental implants?
Tooth loss changes the way you eat, speak and connect with the world around you. Dental implants are the closest thing to natural teeth and offer benefits like:
Better chewing ability.
Enhanced smile.
Improved speech and enunciation.
Jawbone preservation.
Longevity. (Dental implants can last a lifetime with proper hygiene and regular dental visits.)
Stability for wobbly dentures.
Another advantage is that dental implants don’t require
enamel
removal like bridges do. To replace one missing tooth with a dental bridge, your dentist must alter (shave down) at least one tooth on either side of the gap. This can weaken your natural tooth structure over time.

A dental implant replaces your missing tooth without involving the neighboring teeth. It’s a one-tooth solution to a one-tooth problem.
What are the risks or complications of dental implants?
It’s normal to have slight bleeding and swelling after getting your implant. But like any procedure, dental implant surgery carries the possible risk of complications.
Complications are uncommon, but may include:
Damage to nearby teeth.
Delayed jawbone healing.
Infection
.
Jaw fractures
.
Nerve
damage.
Severe bleeding.
Sinus damage.
Very rarely, some people can have an allergic reaction to implants made of titanium. If this happens, a surgeon can replace them with ceramic implants.
When an experienced surgeon places implants, the risk of complications is minimal. If you’re thinking about getting dental implants, be sure to find a provider you trust.
Recovery and Outlook
How long does it take to recover after dental implants?
Initial healing takes about one week. But it takes anywhere from three to nine months for your jawbone to fuse around the implant (a process called osseointegration). This process stabilizes your implant so you can use it just like a natural tooth.
Your provider will check on your progress every few weeks. Once the implant heals, it’s safe to add the restoration (crown, bridge or denture).
How long do dental implants last?
Dental implants last longer than alternative treatments (like bridges and
dentures
). With brushing, flossing and regular
dental visits
, implants can last a lifetime.

The restoration part of your dental implant will need replacing at some point. Most crowns and bridges last around 15 years and most dentures last at least seven years, but this timeline varies.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my dentist?
If you have a dental implant, call your dentist any time you notice:
A loose or wobbly implant.
Bleeding gums
.
Fever
.
Pus (infection) around the implant.
Swollen gums
.
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck
(occurring along with one or more of the above symptoms).
Additional Common Questions
At what age should you not consider dental implants?
The minimum age for dental implants is typically 18, and there’s no upper limit. The main requirement is that you have enough healthy bone in your jaw. Your dentist is the only person who can tell you whether you’re a candidate.
Who shouldn’t get dental implants?
Dental implants might not be the best option if you:
Are under the age of 18. (Most surgeons won’t place dental implants until your jaw stops growing.)
Smoke
or
vape
.
Or if you have:
Active or untreated gum disease.
Certain health conditions (like bone disorders and some
autoimmune diseases
).
Extensive tooth decay.
Poor
oral hygiene
.
Severe bone loss in your jaw.
Every person has a unique health history. To find out for sure if you qualify for dental implants, talk to your dentist.
