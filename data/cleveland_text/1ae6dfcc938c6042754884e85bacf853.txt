Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Disorders
Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) affect the joints that help your jaw move. They can cause pain, clicking, headaches and trouble chewing. TMD is common in adults and often starts between the ages of 20 and 40. Early care can make a big difference in how you feel day to day.

What Are TMJ Disorders?
TMJ disorder affects your jaw joint and muscles, causing pain and movement issues when your jaw opens.
TMJ disorders affect the joints in your jaw and the muscles around them. The medical term is temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), but many people call it TMJ.

Policy
You have two TMJs — one on each side of your face, near your ears. These joints help you chew, talk, and move your jaw.
TMD is common. It affects up to 12 million people in the U.S., mostly between the ages of 20 and 40.
Females
are twice as likely to have it.
The good news? It’s treatable and rarely causes lasting problems.
Symptoms and Causes
Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) symptoms
Signs of TMD can include:
Jaw
or face pain
Headaches or migraines
Jaw stiffness or locking
Clicking, popping, or grinding sounds
Trouble opening or closing your mouth
Earaches or ringing
Tooth pain
Neck or shoulder pain
If these symptoms don’t go away, see a healthcare provider.
TMD causes
TMD can happen for many reasons:
Jaw injury (like a break or dislocation)
Teeth grinding or clenching
(bruxism)
Arthritis in the jaw
A
misaligned bite
Stress that causes jaw tension
Risk factors
Some habits can make TMD worse:
Chewing on pens, ice, or nails
Poor posture
Taking large bites of food
Using teeth as tools
Daytime clenching or sleeping on your stomach
How to lower your risk
Try these tips:
Wear a
mouth guard
if you grind your teeth or play contact sports.
Sit and stand with good posture.
Reduce stress with deep breathing or meditation.
Complications of TMJ disorders
TMD can lead to long-term pain, chewing problems, or damage from grinding your teeth. The causes often overlap, so it may take time to find the right treatment.

Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this disorder
To diagnose TMD, your provider will do a
physical exam
and may order imaging tests. They’ll check how your jaw moves and look for signs of pain or stiffness.
Tests that are used
During your exam, your provider may:
See how wide you can open your mouth
Press around your jaw to check for tenderness
Feel your joints as you open and close your mouth
You may also need imaging tests, like:
Dental X-rays
CT scans
MRIs
Finding TMD early can make treatment more effective.
Management and Treatment
How is TMD treated?
Treatment depends on what’s causing your symptoms and how severe they are. Most people start with noninvasive options.
Medications
Medicines can help ease pain, swelling and muscle tension. Your provider may suggest:
Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) for pain
NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen (Advil®) or naproxen (Aleve®)
Muscle relaxers for clenching or grinding
Antidepressants to help with chronic pain
Nonsurgical options
Many therapies don’t involve surgery. They focus on relaxing your jaw and improving movement:
Custom mouth guards or splints
Jaw exercises through physical therapy
Trigger point injections (like dry needling or steroids)
Ultrasound therapy to relax muscles
TENS (gentle electrical currents) to ease tension
Changing habits, like avoiding hard foods or improving posture
Surgical options
If other treatments don’t help, your provider may suggest surgery, such as:
Arthrocentesis to flush the joint
TMJ arthroscopy (a minimally invasive procedure)
Open-joint surgery for more serious problems
TMD treatment often combines self-care, medical devices and professional care.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If your jaw pain, clicking or stiffness doesn’t improve, talk to a healthcare provider. They can help find what’s causing it and suggest the right treatment.
