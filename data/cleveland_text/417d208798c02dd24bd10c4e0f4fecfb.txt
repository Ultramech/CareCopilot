Beta-Blockers
Beta-blockers are a class of medicines most commonly used for problems involving your heart and circulatory system. They can also help treat conditions related to your brain and nervous system. Beta-blockers work by slowing down certain types of cell activity. This can help manage your blood pressure, heart rate and more.

Beta-blockers are mainly used to treat
heart
and
circulatory conditions
, including:
Aortic dissection
and aortic aneurysms
Arrhythmias
, like
tachycardia
Chest pain (angina)
Congestive heart failure
Coronary artery disease
Heart attack
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart)
They can also help treat other conditions, like:
Essential tremor
Glaucoma
Portal hypertension
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
Performance anxiety
Preventing
migraines
(only some beta-blockers have U.S. FDA approval for this)

Treatment Details
What do beta-blockers do?
Beta-blockers slow down your heart rate and relax
smooth muscle
tissue in your blood vessels. This may help lower your blood pressure.
More specifically, they slow down certain types of cell activity. Your body naturally makes
neurotransmitters
called epinephrine and norepinephrine. They play crucial roles in your body’s response to
stress
and danger (“
fight or flight
”).
Beta-blockers work by blocking the action of
epinephrine
and
norepinephrine
in the organs in your body. By doing so, they can prevent your heart from beating too fast. They can also help relax your heart and blood vessels to lower your blood pressure.

Beta-blockers mainly act on these receptors in your heart and
kidneys
. These are called beta-1 (B1) receptors. You have other types of beta receptors throughout your body as well. Beta-2 receptors are mainly in smooth muscle tissue.
Beta-blockers generally fall into two broad categories: Cardioselective and nonselective. Cardioselective means they block just the B1 receptors. It’s a key consideration when healthcare providers choose which beta-blocker to prescribe.

Nonselective
Acebutolol
Carvedilol
Atenolol
