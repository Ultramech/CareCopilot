Langya Henipavirus
Langya henipavirus is a newly identified virus that’s been diagnosed in 35 people in recent years. Healthcare providers diagnosed it during routine testing in China. It causes mild, flu-like symptoms like fever, cough and fatigue. Related viruses cause serious illness, so providers are monitoring it closely. No one has died from Langya virus.

Overview
What is Langya henipavirus?
Langya henipavirus (or just Langya virus or LayV) is a newly identified virus that causes mild symptoms like coughing and low fever. There have been 35 cases between 2018 and 2021 in China. Healthcare providers identified the cases during routine tests of people with fevers and exposure to animals.

So far, the virus isn’t causing serious symptoms or complications. But Langya virus is similar to viruses that can cause severe illness. It also has a high potential to change (mutate) into something that more easily spreads between people and affect many people at once (outbreaks). For these reasons, scientists are studying it and monitoring cases.
Which countries have Langya virus?
Right now, China is the only place with confirmed Langya virus cases. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist in other countries. It just means we don’t know if LayV exists and could infect people in other parts of the world.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Langya henipavirus?
Symptoms of Langya virus include:
Fever.
Cough.
Loss of appetite.
Tiredness (fatigue).
Headache.
Muscle pain.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
What causes Langya henipavirus?
The LayV virus causes Langya virus infections. It’s similar to
Nipah virus
and Hendra virus (other henipaviruses), which are both more severe. It spreads through contact with shrews, a small rodent. While goats and dogs have tested positive for LayV in areas where humans were diagnosed with it, experts aren’t sure if those animals can spread it to people. Langya virus doesn’t seem to spread from person to person like other henipaviruses do, but could mutate to do so in the future.
What are the risk factors for Langya henipavirus?
Most people who tested positive for LayV worked on farms and had been around shrews.

What are the complications of Langya henipavirus?
Most people infected with Langya virus have had mild cases, but a few people have had complications, including:
Liver failure
.
Kidney failure.
Low white blood cell counts
(white blood cells help fight infections).
Low platelet counts
(platelets help your blood clot and stop bleeding).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Langya henipavirus diagnosed?
Right now, healthcare providers in areas where the virus was found can diagnose it by doing throat and nose swabs. Providers in other parts of the world don’t test for Langya virus.
Providers might also be able to diagnose it through
blood
or pee (
urine
) samples.
Management and Treatment
How Langya henipavirus treated?
There’s no specific
antiviral medications
for Langya virus. You can treat symptoms like fever and cough at home with over-the-counter medications (ones you can get without a prescription, or OTC).

Outlook / Prognosis
Is Langya virus fatal?
So far, no one who’s been diagnosed with Langya virus has died from it. But similar viruses have a high mortality (death) rate, so scientists are monitoring Langya virus closely for changes that would make it more severe.
Additional Common Questions
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of Langya virus and think you might’ve been exposed to the virus because you:
Live in or travel to areas where people have it.
Work with shrews or other animals located where henipaviruses are common.
When should I go to the ER?
Right now, Layva symptoms are mild. But you should go to the emergency room anytime you have:
High fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius).
Difficulty breathing
.
Pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn’t go away.
Confusion.
Seizures
.
Bluish skin, lips or nails (
cyanosis
).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
So far there’s no need to worry about Langya henipavirus. Scientists found it through routine testing, not because it was causing serious illnesses. But similar types of viruses do cause fatal outbreaks. So scientists are watching LayV carefully to make sure healthcare providers can respond quickly if it starts causing outbreaks of severe illness.
If you have concerns, especially if you live in or travel to an area where Langya virus has been found, talk to your healthcare provider. They can answer any questions and address your concerns.
