Loose Tooth
Loose teeth are typical for children. But when an adult has a loose tooth, it could be a symptom of trauma or underlying disease. Treatment depends on the cause but may include bite adjustments, wearing a night guard or oral surgery.

Overview
What is a loose tooth?
A loose tooth is a tooth that’s wiggly. When you’re a kid, loose
teeth
are just a part of life. But having a loose adult (permanent) tooth is never typical. It always points to an underlying issue like
trauma
or disease.

Seeing your
dentist
as soon as you notice symptoms can help you save a loose tooth. Some loose teeth can tighten up again with nonsurgical treatments like
dental cleanings
and improved oral hygiene at home. In other cases, you might need
oral surgery
to repair or remove the loose tooth. But waiting too long to see a dentist could result in more severe complications like pain, swelling and infection.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a loose tooth?
Wobbly teeth can feel strange, especially when you brush, floss or eat. Or a loose tooth might just feel “off” when you bite down.
You might also develop symptoms like:
Red, tender gums.
Bleeding gums
.
Swollen gums
.
Gum recession
.
Tooth discoloration
.
What causes loose teeth?
Kids’ primary (baby) teeth loosen and fall out once their permanent (adult) teeth start to break through the gums.
Causes of loose adult teeth include:
Gum (periodontal) disease
.
Periodontitis
breaks down the bone and ligaments that support your teeth. This is the most common cause of loose teeth (and
tooth loss
) among adults worldwide.
Dental trauma
. Mouth injuries, like sports-related accidents, can cause one or more teeth to loosen.
Teeth grinding (bruxism)
. Grinding or clenching your teeth can cause tooth mobility over time.
Pregnancy
. Surges of
progesterone
and
estrogen
during pregnancy can temporarily loosen the tissues that hold your teeth in place. Healthcare providers call this
pregnancy gingivitis
. People with pregnancy gingivitis usually notice that their symptoms go away after childbirth.

What are the complications of a loose tooth?
If you have a loose tooth, it could result in:
Bite issues (
malocclusion
).
Difficulty chewing.
Excess pressure on neighboring teeth.
These things can cause further damage, resulting in a cycle of oral health problems.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are loose teeth diagnosed?
Most of the time, you’ll know when you have a loose tooth. You’ll be able to feel it with your
tongue
or finger. Or you might notice that your bite feels different when your upper and lower teeth touch.
During an exam, a dentist can tell you more about your loose tooth and come up with a treatment plan to help.
Management and Treatment
How is a loose tooth treated?
Treatment depends on the severity of your condition and what caused the loose tooth to begin with.
If trauma (like an injury or chronic teeth grinding) caused a loose tooth, your dentist might recommend nonsurgical treatments like:
Bite adjustment
. A dentist removes a very small amount of
enamel
from the loose tooth and opposing tooth. This takes excess pressure off your bite and allows your wobbly tooth to heal.
Mouth guard
. If you grind or clench your teeth, this oral appliance can protect your teeth from excessive pressure and damage.
Splinting
. If your loose tooth hasn’t pulled away from your
gums
, splinting may help. During this procedure, a dentist bonds (glues) two neighboring teeth together. This can give your loose tooth additional support and keep it from moving while it heals.
If gum disease caused loose teeth, you might need surgical treatments like:
Scaling and root planing
.
Osseous (flap) surgery
.
Dental bone grafts
.
Gum grafts
.
How can I tighten a loose tooth at home?
Wobbly permanent teeth need professional treatment. Delaying a dental appointment usually only makes symptoms worse. But there are things you can do to care for your loose tooth until you make it to your dentist’s office:
Rinse your mouth with warm salt water to reduce
inflammation
.
Avoid hard, crunchy or chewy foods.
Swish with an antibacterial mouth rinse twice a day to reduce oral
bacteria
.
Doing these things won’t tighten up a loose tooth. But they can reduce your risk of additional complications until you can see your dentist.
How do I know when a loose tooth is beyond saving?
Sometimes, a loose tooth is past the point of saving. When this happens, your dentist will likely recommend
removing the tooth
and replacing it with a
bridge
or
dental implant
.
Ask your dentist about the risks and benefits of each treatment option. They can help you decide which one works best for you.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for loose adult teeth?
Having a loose tooth doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll lose your tooth. In many cases, dentists can save wobbly teeth. But early treatment is key. The sooner you seek care, the better.
Prevention
Can I prevent loose teeth?
You can’t always prevent loose teeth because some causes (like accidents and injuries) are unavoidable. But there are things you can do to lower your risk for loose teeth in general:

oral hygiene
.

When should I see my dentist?
In general, you should see your dentist at regular intervals for exams and cleanings. Many people do well with visits every six months. But you might need more frequent appointments if you’re prone to gum disease or
cavities
. During these visits, your dentist can check your teeth and gums for any issues.
Call your dentist for an additional appointment if you develop loose teeth between visits. It could mean you have gum disease. Your dentist can begin treatment right away to reduce your risk for further issues.
When is a loose adult tooth an emergency?
If you had an injury that caused a loose tooth, like a car accident or sports-related injury, call your dentist right away.
Having a fully or partially
knocked-out (avulsed) tooth
is a dental emergency.
Most dental offices have an emergency number you can call in these situations. If you can’t reach your dentist, head to your nearest ER.
In some cases, dentists can stabilize loose teeth. But stabilization is most successful when treatment begins within one hour of your injury.

Additional Common Questions
My front tooth is loose. What can I do?
Having a loose front tooth can be especially nerve-wracking since it shows when you smile. If you have a loose front tooth, schedule a visit with your dentist right away. They can try to stabilize it.
My child has a loose tooth. Should I leave it or pull it?
If your child has a loose tooth, it’s best to leave it and let it fall out on its own. Primary (baby) teeth help guide permanent (adult) teeth into their proper positions. Removing a baby tooth too early could cause the adult tooth to grow in crooked or lead to other dental issues down the road.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A loose tooth can be a source of anxiety. It might feel weird to you. Or you may wonder if it’ll fall out completely. The good news is that there are treatments for loose teeth. If you notice that something doesn’t feel quite right, don’t wait. Tell your dentist right away. Prompt treatment gives you the best chance of saving your tooth.
