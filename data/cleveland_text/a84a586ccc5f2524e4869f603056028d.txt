Teeth Retainer
If you want to keep your teeth straight after getting your braces off, you need to wear a retainer. This device keeps your teeth in proper alignment for years to come. Follow your dental care provider’s recommendations on when to wear it and how to care for it so you continue to reap the benefits.

What Is a Retainer?
Dental care providers customize teeth retainers so they fit snugly on the teeth they hold in place.
A teeth retainer is a custom-made device you wear over your
teeth
. It helps keep your teeth in their new, correct position after braces. A general dentist or an
orthodontist
fits you for your retainer.

Your braces (or in some cases, clear aligners) straightened your teeth for a long time. But your teeth can still move on their own (back to their previous position) once the braces come off. Wearing a retainer helps keep your teeth in the correct place so they don’t move.
Think of it this way: Braces straighten your teeth. But your retainer keeps them that way. They help your teeth “retain” their position.

How are teeth retainers fitted?
The process for making the retainer for your teeth depends on the type you get:
Removable retainers
are made of wire or plastic. Hawley retainers have a piece of wire attached to plastic or acrylic. Essix retainers are clear, molded plastic you wear over your teeth.
Fixed (permanent) retainers
stay on your teeth with a glue-like bonding agent. You wear them on your front upper or lower teeth to keep them from shifting.
For removable retainers:
Your provider takes a
dental impression
of your teeth. They may use dental putty (a soft, flexible material) to make a mold of your teeth. Or they may use a handheld wand to capture images of your teeth.
They’ll use the mold or images to create the actual retainer. This happens in a dental lab.
You typically wait a week or longer before getting the retainer.

For fixed retainers:
Your dental provider uses a metal wire to measure the correct placement on your teeth.
They use glue to set the wire in place.
The process for fixed retainers takes longer than creating an impression for a removable retainer. But you leave your dental care provider’s office with your retainer in place. You don’t have to wait for a lab to make it.
Do retainers hurt?
You may have some soreness at first. If you do, it’s probably from your retainer nudging your teeth into alignment. You may need to take over-the-counter pain relievers while you adjust.
But your teeth shouldn’t hurt once you start wearing your retainer regularly. The fit should be snug yet comfortable over your teeth.
Ask your provider how much soreness you should expect and for how long. If you have ongoing discomfort, they may need to make adjustments.
How long will I have to wear a retainer?
You’ll likely need to wear your retainer day and night (full-time) for at least four to six months. After that, you’ll need to wear the teeth retainer at night for the rest of your life.
What are the potential benefits and risks?
When your provider takes off your braces, your teeth are perfectly aligned. Using a retainer keeps your teeth in the correct position so the results last. Using a retainer in the long term makes all that hard work of getting and wearing braces or aligners pay off.
Most of the risks have to do with discomfort you might feel if your teeth shift or if your retainer gets damaged. You could feel discomfort if:
You forget to wear your retainer for a short time and then start wearing it again
You haven’t worn your retainer in a long time and then try to wear it
Your retainer breaks or cracks
Not washing your retainer properly can create opportunities for bacteria to grow. They can damage your retainer. Germs can also cause bad breath,
gum disease
and
cavities
.

How do I take care of my retainer?
Follow these tips so you don’t break or lose your retainer:
Take your retainer out of your mouth when you eat.
Don’t chew gum while wearing your retainer.
Put your retainer back in its case when you’re not wearing it.
Don’t wrap your retainer in a napkin, which can make it easy to accidentally throw away.
Never put the retainer in your pocket or purse unless it’s in the case.
Don’t leave your retainer in a hot place where it can melt, like in a car or on a stovetop.
Keep your retainer away from pets who might chew it.
Your dental care provider will provide instructions about how to clean it. Here are some general guidelines:
Clean your retainer at least once a day.
Brush and floss your teeth thoroughly before putting your retainer in. You can floss around a fixed retainer.
Brush your removable retainer regularly with antibacterial soap and water. Some toothpastes are too harsh and may damage your retainer.
Use an effervescent cleanser if it’s safe for your retainer. Ask your dental provider about what products to use.
If your retainer turns yellow, gently scrub it with water, baking soda and a soft toothbrush.

When should I call my healthcare provider?
See your dentist or orthodontist if you lose your retainer or it breaks. A broken retainer can poke and irritate your gums or lips. Don’t wait too long to contact your provider. The longer you wait, the more your teeth can shift back to their previous position. And the more your teeth shift, the harder it is to get your retainer to fit right.
If your retainer is too snug or no longer fits, your teeth have probably shifted. There’s nothing you can do to make your current retainer fit. Your dental provider will need to adjust it or make a new retainer.
Additional Common Questions
Can a retainer straighten my teeth?
No, retainers don’t straighten teeth. Braces or aligners do. Teeth retainers can’t apply the constant, steady force needed to move teeth into their correct positions.
If you forgot to wear your retainer for a few weeks and your teeth have shifted, wearing it may nudge your teeth back. You’ll probably feel some discomfort as the retainer slowly pushes your teeth back into alignment. But this usually only works for small, short-term changes.
What happens to teeth without a retainer?
If you don’t wear your retainer, your teeth will shift and move. Shifting teeth can prevent your upper and lower teeth from aligning when your mouth is closed. That’s why most dental providers prescribe teeth retainers after braces come off.

Why does my removable retainer smell?
Bacteria can grow on a retainer just like they can grow inside your mouth. The bacteria that cause bad breath can also create a nasty smell on your retainer. That’s why cleaning your retainer daily is so important. If your retainer starts to smell, scrub it with soap, water and a soft toothbrush. Ask your dental provider if you can soak it in a special cleanser made for retainers.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Braces give you straight teeth. But your retainer makes them last. A lot of time, energy and money go into the braces that help you achieve that perfect smile. You can keep it for years by following your dental provider’s recommendations for a teeth retainer. Make using one part of your routine.
