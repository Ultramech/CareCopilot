Discoid Lupus
Chronic cutaneous lupus, or discoid lupus, causes skin lesions (sores). These lesions usually occur on your scalp or face. Discoid lesions are not typically painful or itchy. There is no cure for discoid lupus, but treatment can help. These lesions can increase your risk for skin cancer, so it’s important to protect your skin.

People with discoid lupus get round sores, usually on their face or scalp. Another name for discoid lupus is chronic cutaneous lupus.
What is lupus?
What most people call lupus is
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
. SLE is the most common type of lupus. About 70% of people who have lupus have SLE.
SLE causes widespread
inflammation
in your body. People with lupus often have:
Chest pain
.
Fatigue
.
Fever
.
Joint pain
or swelling.
Rashes
or other skin symptoms.
Sensitivity to light (photosensitivity).
What are the types of cutaneous lupus erythematosus?
There are three types of CLE. Each type causes a different skin
rash
:
Discoid lupus:
Causes circular patches of thick, inflamed skin on your ears, cheeks or nose.
Subacute cutaneous lupus:
Ring-shaped or scaly rashes appear, usually on your back, chest or neck.
Acute cutaneous lupus:
Known for a “butterfly rash” that looks like a sunburn across your cheeks and nose.
Can you have more than one kind of lupus?
Some people only have SLE, CLE or another type of lupus. Others have multiple types of lupus.
Most people who have discoid lupus do not have another type of lupus. Only about 5% of people with discoid lupus also develop SLE. About one in four people with SLE develop lesions that look like discoid lesions.
How common is DLE?
About two out of every three people who have systemic lupus also have symptoms of cutaneous lupus. Discoid lupus is the most common type of CLE.

Symptoms and Causes
What causes chronic cutaneous lupus?
Experts don’t know what causes lupus, including discoid lupus. Lupus and other autoimmune diseases tend to run in families.
Who is most likely to have discoid lupus?
You have a higher risk for developing chronic cutaneous lupus if you are:
Female.
Age 15 to 44, with women in their 30s and 40s most commonly affected.
Black (with risk up to four times higher in Black women than in white women), Asian American, Hispanic/Latino or Native American.
What are the symptoms of discoid lupus?
Discoid lupus causes round, coin-shaped lesions (sores). The sores most commonly develop on your scalp and face, but they may show up on other parts of your body.
Discoid lesions typically do not hurt or itch. They may be scaly, thick or red. When the lesions go away, they may leave scars or skin discoloration.
What are the complications of discoid lupus?
If a discoid lupus rash occurs on your scalp, it may cause
hair loss
. If a scar forms on your scalp, the hair loss may be permanent.
Having a discoid rash that lasts a long time may increase your risk for
skin cancer
. Discoid sores inside your mouth can increase your risk for a type of skin cancer called
squamous cell carcinoma
.
Rarely, people may develop chilblain lupus erythematosus.
Chilblain lupus
causes purple skin patches or lesions that worsen after exposure to cold temperatures. These lesions are often very painful.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is discoid lupus diagnosed?
A
dermatologist
(skin care doctor) may diagnose discoid lupus. Usually, the dermatologist uses a test called a
biopsy
.
During a biopsy, your dermatologist takes a small skin sample. The provider sends the skin sample to a laboratory, where specialists examine it under a microscope. Looking at the skin sample under a microscope can tell healthcare providers whether skin sores are due to discoid lupus or another condition.
Management and Treatment
How is discoid lupus treated?
Depending on how severe your symptoms are, your healthcare provider may recommend medications. These medications can reduce discoid lupus symptoms.
Some research suggests that medications are helpful for about 60% of people with cutaneous lupus. Discoid lupus treatment may include:
Steroid ointments, such as fluocinolone acetonide (Synalar®) or hydrocortisone butyrate (Locoid®), lower inflammation and decrease swelling.
Anti-inflammatory drugs such as dapsone (Aczone®) or low-dose methotrexate (Otrexup™, Rasuvo®) reduce pain and swelling.
Antimalarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®), fight fatigue, reduce rashes and decrease joint pain.
Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus (Protopic®, Prograf®) or pimecrolimus (Elidel®), decrease inflammation by suppressing your
immune system
.

How can I prevent discoid lupus symptom flare-ups?
In up to 70% of people who have CLE, their symptoms worsen after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. If you have lupus, you need to take extra caution around UV rays.
To prevent discoid lupus symptom flare-ups and
protect yourself from light exposure
:
Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily. Reapply sunscreen every four hours.
Avoid sunlight when the sun’s rays are strongest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Limit your time under indoor fluorescent lights.
Don’t use tanning beds at all.
Wear sun-protective clothing, such as long sleeves and wide-brimmed hats.
