Serratia marcescens
Serratia marcescens is bacteria that sometimes causes infections, including UTIs and pneumonia. You’re at higher risk for infection if you’re in the hospital or at a long-term care facility, have a weakened immune system or a medical device in your body. S. marcescens can be hard to treat because it’s often resistant to many antibiotics.

What Is Serratia marcescens?
Symptoms of Serratia marcescens depend on where in your body you’re infected.
Serratia marcescens
(
S. marcescens
) is a type of
bacteria
that’s found in the environment and can sometimes cause infections in people. Infections — when they happen — usually only spread in hospitals or long-term care facilities (
nosocomial infections
). These can be hard to treat because they can develop
antibiotic resistance
(when antibiotics don’t work to get rid of the infection).

S. marcescens
can cause:
Respiratory tract infections, like
pneumonia
Urinary tract infections
(UTIs)
Eye infections
, like
keratitis
Wound infections
Abdominal infections (
peritonitis
)
Infections around your brain and spinal cord (
meningitis
)
Bone infections (
osteomyelitis
)
Heart inflammation (
endocarditis
)
Bloodstream infections (
septicemia
)
You may even sometimes see
S. marcescens
around your house. It looks like a pink film and can grow in moist environments, like showers or toilet bowls. Fortunately, most people don’t get sick from
S. marcescens
growing in their homes or the environment.
Serratia marcescens
is pronounced “sir-AY-shuh maar-SEH-senz.”
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of
Serratia marcescens
infection
Symptoms of an
S. marcescens
infection depend on where in your body you’re infected. Some symptoms could include:
Fever
Chills
Lethargy
(extreme tiredness)
Examples of specific symptoms based on infection site include:
Shortness of breath
, cough, pink-tinged mucus or
chest pain
(respiratory tract infections)
Eye pain
or redness (eye infections)
Difficulty peeing, pink-tinged pee or
pain when you pee
(urinary tract infection)
Headache,
stiff neck
or
sensitivity to light
(meningitis)
How do you get a
Serratia marcescens
infection?
Most of the time, people get
S. marcescens
infections in hospitals or long-term health facilities. The bacteria can spread:
Advertisement
From person to person
Through contaminated medical equipment
Through a medical device in your body (like a
Foley (bladder) catheter
or
breathing tube
)
Sometimes, people get eye infections from contaminated
contact lenses
.
Risk factors
You might be at higher risk for an
S. marcescens
infection if you have:
A weakened immune system
Cancer
Diabetes
A medical device that goes into your body, like a breathing tube,
feeding tube
or Foley catheter
Been in a hospital or other healthcare facility for a long time
Been on
antibiotics
for a long time, or use them frequently
People who inject drugs into their veins are also at higher risk.
Complications
If
S. marcescens
spreads to your blood, it can cause serious complications, including:
Sepsis
Shock
Organ failure
Diagnosis and Tests
How do doctors diagnose an
S. marcescens
infection?
How a healthcare provider diagnoses an
S. marcescens
infection depends on your symptoms and where you’re infected. They may take samples from your body to try to grow (
culture
)
S. marcescens
, including:
Sputum (
mucus
coughed up from your lungs)
Blood
Pee (
urine
)
Fluid or tissue from a wound
Fluid from around your brain and spine (cerebrospinal fluid)
Management and Treatment
How is
Serratia marcescens
treated?
Providers treat
Serratia marcescens
with antibiotics. Because the bacteria can have antibiotic resistance, a lab might test a sample of the bacteria to see which drug is most effective against it. It might take a combination of medications to get rid of the infection.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Even when you’re in the hospital — or if you’ve just gone home — communication with your healthcare team is important. You know when something isn’t right with your body, even if it’s not immediately clear to someone else. Let them know if you’re experiencing symptoms of an infection, like pain, rapid heart rate, weakness or fever.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have an
S. marcescens
infection?
What to expect with an
S. marcescens
infection depends a lot on where in your body you’re infected and any existing health conditions (
comorbidities
). For example, urinary tract infections are often treatable. Bacteria in your bloodstream is more serious.
Make sure to take all of your medication as prescribed, even if you feel better.
Prevention
Can
Serratia marcescens
be prevented?
Healthcare providers follow safety and sterilization rules to prevent
healthcare-acquired infections
like
S. marcescens
. These include:
Hand washing
Disinfecting surfaces
Ensuring that people only take antibiotics when they have
bacterial infections
Sterilizing medical devices
Quarantining (isolating) people with
S. marcescens
infections so it doesn’t spread to other people
You can help prevent
S. marcescens
infections by
washing your hands frequently
, especially if you’re caring for someone with a weakened immune system or who’s spent a long time in a healthcare facility recently. You can also ask your provider how long you need to use invasive medical devices like catheters.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Healthcare providers work to keep hospitals and long-term care facilities safe. But sometimes, hospital-acquired infections with bacteria like
Serratia marcescens
still happen. While some infections are easily treatable, others can be serious. Don’t hesitate to speak up to a provider if you’re concerned about
S. marcescens
for you or a loved one in their care. They can answer any questions you have.
