Subacute cutaneous lupus can be tricky to understand. Like other forms of lupus, it can look and act differently for everyone who has it. That can make it hard to diagnose. Look for a healthcare provider who will listen to your concerns and help you find treatment to manage the condition. It may also be helpful to look for support groups in your area or online. By listening to the experiences of others with the condition, you may feel more empowered to manage the disease.

This rash combines bumps (papules) with scales (squamous). It may resemble
eczema
or
psoriasis
. It’s triggered by sunlight and appears on sun-exposed areas
