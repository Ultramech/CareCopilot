Lip Lines
Lip lines are vertical wrinkles that develop along and above your upper lip. Lip lines are part of the natural aging process. But habits such as smoking and sun exposure can create deeper lip wrinkles. Cosmetic treatments, including fillers, can reduce lip lines and help you look younger.

What are other names for lip lines?
Lip lines are also called smoker’s lines and lipstick lines. Healthcare providers may use the terms “perioral rhytides” or “perioral wrinkles.” (“Peri” means “around,” and “oral” means “mouth.”)
Are lip lines the same as smile lines?
No, lip lines and smile lines are on different locations on your face. Smile lines (
nasolabial folds
) are wrinkles that extend from the sides of your nose to the corners of your mouth.
Marionette lines
are another type of wrinkle that travel from the corners of your mouth to your chin.
Why am I getting lip lines?
You may develop lip lines for a range of reasons, including the natural aging process and certain lifestyle habits. The underlying cause is activity of the muscle around the mouth, which becomes more active with time.
At what age do lip lines typically develop?
Lip lines usually develop around your 40s. But you might see lip wrinkles earlier if you smoke or have sun-damaged skin.
Symptoms and Causes
What do lip lines look like?
Lip lines are vertical creases on both lips and on the skin above your lips. If you wear lipstick, these wrinkles can look more pronounced.
What causes lip lines?
Over time, everyone develops lip lines. As you age, you naturally lose
collagen
and
elastin
, proteins that create supple, smooth and hydrated skin.
Other causes of lip wrinkles include:
Excessive alcohol consumption.
Genetics, if your parents or grandparents have pronounced lip lines.
Not enough sleep.
Repetitive movements like pursing your lips or sipping through a straw.
Smoking
.
Sun damage

Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose lip lines?
A plastic surgeon may use a rating scale to diagnose the severity of lip lines. For example, lip wrinkles may be:
Mild with shallow lines.
Moderate with deeper lines.
Severe with thick creases.
Management and Treatment
What is the best treatment for lip lines?
The best treatment for lip lines varies by person. Your
plastic surgeon
may recommend treatments based on:
The severity of the lip lines.
Whether you want additional cosmetic changes.
Your current health.
Your goals.
How do I get rid of the lines on my lips?
You can’t permanently get rid of lip lines. But some treatments can reduce or temporarily improve lip wrinkles.
These
cosmetic procedures
don’t require any incisions:
Botulinum toxin (Botox®) injections
.
Chemical peels
.
Dermabrasion
.
Laser skin resurfacing
.
Lip fillers
.
Microneedling
, with or without radiofrequency (collagen induction therapy), which creates small punctures in your skin, stimulating collagen and elastin production.
Platelet-rich plasma
.
Can surgery get rid of lip lines?
Several cosmetic surgeries may improve or get rid of lip wrinkles, such as:
Fat transfer
injections.
Lip implants.
These procedures may help with on-the-lip wrinkles. But treatments may be less effective in reducing lines above your lips.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have lip lines?
Without treatment and sun protection, lip lines may worsen and become more pronounced over time.
How long do lip lines last?
Lip lines last forever. If you opt for cosmetic procedures, you may reduce lip wrinkles or temporarily get rid of them. Botox may last up to six months, while lip fillers can last up to 12 months.
Lip implants and fat transfer injections are more long-lasting options, but they may not get rid of all lip wrinkles. Talk to a plastic surgeon about what results you can expect with nonsurgical and surgical lip procedures.
Prevention
How can I prevent lip lines?
You can’t prevent lip wrinkles from developing. But these tips can help lessen their severity, reduce signs of aging and improve the health of your skin and lips:
Diet tips
Consume less
caffeine
.
Eat foods with nutrients, such as avocado, berries, broccoli and spinach.
Limit your alcohol intake.
Stay hydrated
.
Lifestyle tips
Apply sunscreen with SPF 30 every day and use lip balm.
Apply a daily antioxidant like topical vitamin C.
Follow healthy
skin care
practices.
Get quality
sleep
.
Quit smoking
.
Manage stress
.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Lip lines are subtle or deep-set vertical lines on or above your lips. Lip wrinkles tend to worsen with age. Healthy habits and cosmetic treatments can reduce lip wrinkles and create a more youthful appearance. Talk to a plastic surgeon about the best treatment for your goals and wrinkle severity.
