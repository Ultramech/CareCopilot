Immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressants are drugs that prevent your immune system from attacking healthy cells and tissues by mistake. Healthcare providers prescribe immunosuppressants to treat certain autoimmune diseases and prevent organ or stem cell transplant rejection. These medications also increase your risk of infection because your immune system isn’t working as it should.

Overview
What are immunosuppressants?
Immunosuppressants are drugs that keep your
immune system
working as it should. Normally, your immune system is an infection-fighting machine that targets intruders like
viruses
,
bacteria
and cancerous cells. But sometimes, your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. Immunosuppressants can slow or stop this response. But immunosuppressants also weaken your immune system, increasing your risk of
viral
,
bacterial
and
fungal infections
.

When do healthcare providers use immunosuppressants?
Healthcare providers prescribe immunosuppressants to treat
autoimmune diseases
. People who have organ transplants or
stem cell transplants
(bone marrow transplants) receive immunosuppressants so their immune systems don’t attack the transplanted organ or
stem cells
.
Autoimmune diseases
If you have an autoimmune disease, it means your immune system stops protecting your body from invaders and starts attacking healthy tissue and cells. Immunosuppressants hold back your immune system, helping prevent further cell damage and
inflammation
. These drugs minimize symptoms. They can even put some autoimmune diseases into remission (where you have no signs of the disease).
You may need immunosuppressants if you have one of these autoimmune diseases:
Alopecia areata
.
Inflammatory bowel disease
, including
Crohn’s disease
and
ulcerative colitis
.
Lupus
.
Multiple sclerosis
(MS).
Psoriasis
or
psoriatic arthritis
.
Rheumatoid arthritis
(RA).
Stem cell (bone marrow) transplants
Sometimes, people with blood cancers, blood disorders or
bone marrow
issues have
allogeneic stem cell transplants
. These transplants use donated stem cells to replace unhealthy stem cells so your body can start building a new immune system. Healthcare providers treat many conditions with stem cell transplants, including:

Blood cancers
, like
leukemia
,
lymphoma
and
multiple myeloma
.
Blood disorders
, like
sickle cell disease
and
thalassemia
.
Bone marrow issues, like
aplastic anemia
.
This new immune system may view your body as foreign and start attacking your healthy tissues and organs. This is called
graft-versus-host disease
(GvHD). Immunosuppressants can lower the chances of GvHD, and are used to help prevent and treat GVHD. You may receive different intravenous (IV) or oral immunosuppressants for several days, weeks or months during and after a stem cell transplant. You may need to take immunosuppressants for years until your new immune system settles down.
Organ transplants
If you need an
organ transplant
, immunosuppressants reduce the risk that your body will reject the transplanted organ. Organ rejection happens because your immune system knows the transplanted organ is new to your body and will treat it like an intruder that should be destroyed. Immunosuppressants protect newly transplanted organs by keeping your immune system’s response managed.
Treatment Details
How would I take an immunosuppressant?
You may receive immunosuppressants as a pill, liquid, injection or intravenously. Depending on your situation, you may need immunosuppressants for several months up to a year, or longer. For example, people with autoimmune disease may take immunosuppressants indefinitely. People with organ or stem cell transplants take immunosuppressants long term, according to the advice of their healthcare provider.
Anthony Fernandez, MD, explains what biologics are and how they are used to treat psoriasis.
What are the most common immunosuppressants?
Corticosteroids
, such as prednisone, are among the most common immunosuppressants that healthcare providers prescribe. But there are many types of immunosuppressants. Your provider will select a medicine (or a combination of immunosuppressants) based on your specific condition and symptoms. Types of immunosuppressants include:
Biologics
, like
adalimumab
(Humira®) and
infliximab
(Remicade®). Biologics are lab-made drugs that reduce your immune system’s response to intruders.
Calcineurin inhibitors
, like
tacrolimus
(Envarsus XR® or Protopic®) and
cyclosporine
(Gengraf®, Neoral® or Sandimmune®). Calcineurin inhibitors work by blocking an enzyme that stimulates T-cells. T-cells are white blood cells that fight infection.
Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) inhibitors
, like
mycophenolate
mofetil
(CellCept®), that affect cell growth.
Janus kinase inhibitors
, like (Xeljanz®). These drugs reduce inflammation by limiting the activity of certain enzymes (Janus kinases). They’re a type of
immunomodulator
.
Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors
,such as
sirolimus
(Rapamune®). mTOR inhibitors keep cells from growing and multiplying.
Monoclonal antibodies
,like
basiliximab
(Simulect®), that stimulate your immune system to prevent organ transplant rejection.

Risks / Benefits
What are immunosuppressants’ potential benefits?
When your immune system attacks your body, immunosuppressants keep it managed. Immunosuppressants treat some autoimmune disorders. If you have a donated organ or stem cells, immunosuppressants help prevent your body from rejecting your new organ or stem cells.
What are immunosuppressant side effects?
Immunosuppressants are powerful drugs that can cause many side effects:
Acne
.
Diabetes
.
Fatigue
.
Hair loss or growth.
Headaches
.
High blood pressure
.
Mouth sores
.
Thinning bones (
osteoporosis
).
Tremors (shaking).
Weight gain.
Stomach upset
and
nausea
and
vomiting
.
What are the risks or complications of taking immunosuppressants?
Immunosuppressants can successfully treat some autoimmune diseases or help reduce the risk that your body will reject transplanted organs or stem cells. But there are potential risks or complications.
Missing doses
It’s very important that you take immunosuppressants exactly as prescribed. If you have an autoimmune disorder, skipping a dose may cause your condition to flare up or suddenly get worse. If you’re living with donor organs or stem cells, missing doses increases the risk your body will reject them.
Increased risk of infection
Your immune system protects you from intruders like bacteria, viruses or cancer. If you’re taking immunosuppressants, it means your immune system won’t work as well as it should to get rid of harmful invaders. Your provider may call this being immunocompromised. That increases your risk of infections that may be life-threatening, such as:
Advertisement
Blood infections, like
MRSA
and
sepsis
.
Fungal infections, like
thrush
and
skin fungus
.
Skin infections, like
cellulitis
.
Respiratory infections, including
colds
,
flu
and
pneumonia
.
Recovery and Outlook
Is there anything I can do to make this treatment easier on me?
If you’re taking immunosuppressants, you’re putting a deliberate, but necessary, dent in your body’s ability to protect you from infection. Here are some things you can do to stay healthy while you’re receiving immunosuppressants:
Wash your hands
.
Talk to your healthcare provider about what
vaccines
you need.
Boost your immune system with nutrient-rich food like fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins and dairy.
Get enough rest. A good night’s sleep can support your immune system.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Your provider will explain what symptoms may be signs your immunosuppressant isn’t working as well as expected. They’ll monitor your overall health while you’re taking immunosuppressants. They’ll do frequent
blood tests
to ensure the immunosuppressant is working and to watch for side effects.
Additional Common Questions
Do immunosuppressants affect pregnancy?
Anyone who takes immunosuppressants should talk to their healthcare providers before conceiving. Some immunosuppressants can cause
birth defects
. Some medicines may be harmful to take during
pregnancy
or while
breastfeeding
. You may need to switch to a different medicine.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Immunosuppressants offer lifesaving benefits for many people. But suppressing your immune system can lead to side effects and increase your risk of health complications like infections. In some cases, those infections could be life-threatening. Your healthcare provider will carefully check on your condition and check for medication side effects. They may change medicines or dosage amounts, so you get effective treatment that causes the fewest side effects and complications. Let your provider know if your side effects are more significant than expected.
