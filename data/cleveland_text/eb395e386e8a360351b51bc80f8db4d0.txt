Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) (Type 1.5 diabetes) is a type of diabetes that has characteristics of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It happens because your body makes antibodies that attack insulin-producing cells in your pancreas. Symptoms begin in adulthood and worsen gradually, which often leads to a Type 2 diagnosis by mistake.

Overview
What is latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)?
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a type of
diabetes
that features elements of both
Type 1
and
Type 2 diabetes
. That’s why it’s also known as Type 1.5 diabetes. Healthcare providers believe an
autoimmune condition
causes LADA (like Type 1 diabetes). But a diagnosis typically comes in adulthood and happens gradually (like Type 2 diabetes). For this reason, it’s often misdiagnosed as Type 2.

Healthcare providers diagnose it in adults between ages 30 and 50.
How rare is LADA diabetes?
Even though many people haven’t heard of it, LADA is fairly common.
Studies
suggest that between 4% and 12% of people who initially receive a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis end up having LADA. To put that in perspective, about 530 million adults worldwide have Type 2. This means several million people potentially have LADA diabetes.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of LADA diabetes?
The symptoms of Type 1.5 diabetes are like those of other forms of diabetes. Some of the most common are:
Being very thirsty (
polydipsia
).
Needing to pee
more often.
Losing weight
unexpectedly.
Blurred vision
.
Fatigue
.
Itchy,
dry skin
.
What causes it?
Researchers suspect LADA happens when
antibodies
mistakenly attack and destroy cells in your
pancreas
that make
insulin
. When you can’t release insulin, sugar (glucose) builds up in your bloodstream. In this way, it’s like Type 1 diabetes. People with Type 1 need
insulin injections
to survive. Many people with Type 1 are diagnosed as a child or in their teens.
But, like Type 2 diabetes, a LADA diagnosis happens more often in adults with symptoms beginning slowly. This is because your pancreas stops making insulin gradually, which can make it hard to notice symptoms. You may not need insulin injections for months or years. This is why some providers initially suspect Type 2 and not LADA diabetes.

What triggers LADA diabetes?
There aren’t any triggers for LADA because it’s something your immune system does without your control. LADA diabetes can go unnoticed because your pancreas still releases enough insulin not to cause symptoms.
What are the risk factors?
LADA has a strong
genetic component
, which means you may be susceptible to it if your biological parents or grandparents have it. There’s also evidence that environmental and lifestyle factors play a role in developing LADA. These include things like having
obesity
.
What are the complications?
The biggest complication comes from not receiving the right treatment for the condition. Because it can appear to be Type 2 diabetes, you may not get treatment with insulin as early as you need it. This can increase your risk for health complications like kidney damage.
Diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA)
is a life-threatening complication of LADA diabetes. It happens when your
liver
starts breaking down body fat for energy because you don’t have enough glucose (blood sugar) in your cells to use for energy.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is LADA diabetes diagnosed?
LADA usually affects adults who initially receive a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis. But, once you’re unable to manage your blood sugar with oral medications (like
metformin
) and lifestyle modifications (like eating nutritious foods), healthcare providers may suspect Type 1.5 diabetes.
Your healthcare provider will diagnose LADA with a
blood test
called a GAD Antibodies Test (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies). It looks for autoantibodies that target glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). If your provider finds signs of these autoantibodies in your blood, it can mean you have an autoimmune disorder that affects your pancreas. If you’re an adult, that likely means you have LADA.
Your provider may also order a
C-peptide test
, which measures how much C-peptide is in your blood. C-peptides tell your provider how much insulin your pancreas is making.
Management and Treatment
What’s the treatment for LADA diabetes?
Treating LADA is tricky because, initially, you may respond to
oral diabetes medications
. They may help you manage your blood sugar levels temporarily. But as the condition worsens, your body will respond less. You’ll need to switch to insulin injections to manage your blood sugar because your pancreas will completely lose its ability to create its own insulin. This can happen after a few months or a few years.
There isn’t one agreed-upon treatment for LADA. Some experts believe treatment with insulin from the get-go is best, while others may wait to start you on insulin injections.
The dosage and amount of insulin you need can vary, so you’ll still need to
monitor your blood sugar
levels.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
There’s no cure for Type 1.5 diabetes, but your healthcare provider will help you find treatments to manage it. Once you begin taking insulin, you’ll be better able to manage your blood sugar levels.
What is the life expectancy of someone with LADA diabetes?
Your life expectancy depends on several factors. Having Type 1.5 diabetes alone doesn’t decrease your lifespan. But if you have LADA diabetes and can’t manage your glucose levels, you’re at risk for health complications that can shorten your life expectancy. This is mainly because chronic
high blood sugar
levels can lead to issues like
heart disease
, which can impact lifespan.
Prevention
Can you prevent LADA diabetes?
There’s no way to prevent LADA diabetes, because you can’t control or prevent the autoimmune condition that causes it. Getting an early diagnosis and starting treatment right away is the best way to prevent complications from the condition.

How do I take care of myself if I have type 1.5 diabetes?
The best way to take care of yourself is to manage your blood sugar. LADA diabetes is often misdiagnosed. It can be frustrating to think you’re doing everything right, only to find that your blood sugar is still hard to manage. If you receive a LADA diagnosis, follow the treatment plan your provider helps you create. Be sure to attend all your follow-up appointments. These visits help your provider check on your pancreas and overall health. They’ll also adjust how much insulin you need.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of diabetes like excessive thirst and frequent urination. Be sure to share your complete health history with your healthcare provider.
If you receive a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis and find that your symptoms aren’t getting better after treatment, ask your provider about testing for Type 1.5 diabetes.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Type 1.5 diabetes or LADA is often misdiagnosed. It has traits of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, but its symptoms often point to Type 2. It can be frustrating and confusing to find out you have this type of diabetes. You may have started taking oral medication only to find your blood sugar levels are still consistently high. Or treatment may work for a little while, then stop working. Your healthcare providers will help you understand the best ways to manage your blood sugar and maintain your overall health. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about your diagnosis and treatment plan.
