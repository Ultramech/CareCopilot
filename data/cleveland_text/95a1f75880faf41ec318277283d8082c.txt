ARFID can cause you to:
Lose interest in eating.
Feel anxious about the consequences of eating, like choking on food or vomiting.
Avoid foods that have an unwanted color, taste, texture or smell.
You might hear your healthcare provider call ARFID “selective eating disorder.” This is because you may only choose a few things that are OK to eat. You may also create rituals or patterns of behavior around the way you eat, like eating your food in a specific order.
ARFID can affect your nutrient intake, which can affect your overall health. It may lead to life-threatening complications if left untreated.
Is avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) the same as picky eating?
No, ARFID isn’t the same as
picky eating
. Children may avoid certain foods because they don’t like the look, taste, smell or texture. Picky eating usually only targets a few foods and doesn’t affect your child’s appetite or their growth and development. Picky eating can also go away as a child grows. ARFID can cause complications that do affect your appetite and overall health due to a lack of adequate nutrition. This condition doesn’t go away without treatment.
How common is avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)?
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a newer diagnosis in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (
DSM-5
)
. This means that there’s not a lot of data available to estimate how this condition affects a large-scale population.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will look for certain criteria when diagnosing avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). They’ll make an ARFID diagnosis if the following are true:
Limited food intake leads to significant weight loss and growth difficulties for children; your body isn’t getting enough nutrients; you’re dependent on tube feeding or taking vitamins and supplements to get nutrients and/or food restriction affects your interpersonal relationships.
Limited food intake isn’t caused by food insecurity, religious fasting or an underlying medical condition or treatment.
Limited food intake isn’t caused by a negative body image or a desire to lose weight or change your body shape.
If limited food intake was the result of a medical condition or treatment, it exceeds what’s expected as a side effect and causes major complications to your overall health.

Be more comfortable with sensory challenges.
A healthcare provider may offer medications to help restore your mind and body to good health and prevent life-threatening complications. These medications can be

Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference: ARFID vs. anorexia?
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and
anorexia nervosa
are both mental health conditions that cause you to restrict your food intake. Anorexia happens when you have a negative self-image and restrict food intake to change the way your body looks. ARFID is restrictive eating that isn’t caused by a distorted image of yourself.
Is ARFID a form of autism spectrum disorder?
No. ARFID may include characteristics similar to
autism spectrum disorder
, but they’re different conditions. A person may have an aversion to foods with certain textures with either condition. People diagnosed with ARFID can have severe complications like malnutrition due to their sensory aversion.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder) is a complex mental health condition that won’t go away without treatment. While the condition may look like picky eating, ARFID can have dangerous complications on your body if you’re not able to consume the nutrients you need to survive. Treatment is available, but it won’t resolve in one day. It takes the help of your care team and support from your loved ones to get you back to good health.
