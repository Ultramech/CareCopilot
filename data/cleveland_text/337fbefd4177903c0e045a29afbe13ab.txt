Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is inflammation that happens when your immune system releases excessive amounts of cytokines into your bloodstream. Excessive amounts of cytokines cause widespread inflammation that damages organs and tissues. CRS may happen after immunotherapy. Other causes are bacterial and viral infections or autoimmune diseases.

Cytokines
are proteins that are part of a healthy immune system. They help control the growth and activity of your blood cells and immune cells. But a flood of cytokines may cause widespread
inflammation
. This can lead to serious and sometimes life-threatening conditions, including
organ failure
.
Cytokine release syndrome falls under the medical condition cytokine storm.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of cytokine release syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome symptoms can be mild. You may feel like you have the flu. But the syndrome may affect different areas of your body, causing symptoms like:
Chills and high fever
Confusion and dizziness
Diarrhea
Difficulty swallowing
Headaches
Joint and muscle pain
Nausea and vomiting
Skin rash
Tiredness
Cytokine release syndrome causes
The syndrome happens when your immune system overreacts and releases large amounts of cytokines. Immunotherapy for cancer, particularly
CAR-T cell therapy
and bispecific antibodies, is the most common trigger.
Risk factors
Having an
autoimmune disease
or certain genetic conditions that affect your immune system may increase your risk. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (
HLH
) is an example of a genetic condition that can lead to cytokine release syndrome.
Complications of this syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome can cause severe inflammation in your kidneys, liver or lungs. But it may also damage your blood vessels or heart. Without prompt treatment, CRS may cause serious medical issues. Some may be life-threatening, including:

Capillary leak syndrome
Cardiomyopathy
and heart failure
Kidney failure
Liver failure
Lung failure and very
low oxygen levels
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this syndrome
Healthcare providers diagnose CRS in different ways depending on the cause. For example, if you receive immunotherapy, your provider will watch for CRS symptoms. Those symptoms may show up within 24 hours or up to two weeks after your treatment. If you develop symptoms, your provider may do tests, including:
Complete blood count (CBC)
Cytokine levels
C-reactive protein test and other tests to check inflammation levels
Kidney and liver function
Cytokine release syndrome grades
Cytokine release syndrome grades range from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the more serious the condition. Your healthcare provider will consider the following issues to establish a grade for your condition:
You have a high fever, low blood pressure or a fast heartbeat.
They need to take steps to keep your
vital signs
stable.
You need mechanical ventilation.
You have organ failure symptoms, like weakness and fast, shallow breathing.
Management and Treatment
Cytokine release syndrome treatment
Your treatment will vary depending on the reason why you have CRS. For example, treatment for severe CRS from immunotherapy may include:
Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation
Medication that targets specific cytokines, like
siltuximab
(Sylvant
®
),
tocilizumab
(Actemra
®
) and
anakinra
(Kineret
®
)
Medication for very low blood pressure
Mechanical ventilation
Recovery time
Your recovery time depends on your situation. People with mild CRS symptoms after immunotherapy usually recover within one to two weeks. Your recovery may take longer if an infection causes CRS.
When should I seek care?
Contact your healthcare provider if immunotherapy causes a fever or other CRS symptoms. The condition can worsen quickly. This increases your risk of life-threatening complications. It’s important that you get medical care right away.

What can I expect if I have CRS?
