Diagnosis and Tests
How is vascular pain diagnosed?
To diagnose vascular pain, your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They often look for physical signs of vascular diseases, such as discoloration, weeping, ulcers or a weak pulse in your arm or lower leg.
Your provider may also use tests that assess your blood flow, including:
Arteriogram:
They inject a special dye into your blood vessels, then use an
X-ray
to examine how the dye moves through your arteries and veins.
Doppler ultrasound
:
They use sound waves to look at the speed and direction of blood flow through your body.
Magnetic resonance
angiogram
:
Your provider uses magnets and radio waves (
MRIs
) to look at your blood flow. These tests may also use a contrast dye to highlight your arteries and veins.
Management and Treatment
How is vascular pain treated?
Treatment for vascular pain depends on your specific symptoms and the underlying cause of pain. Your provider may recommend:
Medications:
Medicines to lower blood pressure, thin your blood or prevent
blood clots
may treat vascular disease and resolve pain.
Angioplasty
:
Your provider uses a small, hollow tube (catheter) and a balloon to open a blocked artery. They may also place a small mesh tube called a
stent
to help keep your blood vessel open long-term.
Bypass surgery
:
A surgeon takes a healthy blood vessel from another part of your body and creates a new route for blood flow. This new route bypasses your blocked or damaged blood vessel.
How do you relieve vascular pain?
Vascular pain can disrupt your daily activities. But there are several steps you can take to manage pain, including:
Exercise regularly, aiming for at least 150 minutes of
aerobic exercise
each week.
Get up and move or stretch at least once an hour during your workday, especially if you have a sedentary job.
Wear compression stockings, particularly if you stand for long periods or are traveling on a long trip. Compression stockings are special socks that provide gentle pressure to your ankles and feet.
