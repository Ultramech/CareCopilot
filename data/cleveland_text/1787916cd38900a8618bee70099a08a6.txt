Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a fast-growing, noncancerous growth that forms behind your nose. Surgical removal is the standard treatment. But even after removal, the tumor can come back. JNA has a high survival rate, but it may require lifelong management.

What Is Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)?
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare,
noncancerous tumor
that grows behind your
nose
. It’s a vascular growth, which means it’s mostly filled with
blood vessels
.

Breaking down the condition’s name is the best way to understand it:
“Juvenile” means young person.
“Nasopharyngeal” refers to the areas around your nose and throat.
“Angiofibroma” refers to a noncancerous tumor that’s made of blood vessels and connective tissue.
JNA isn’t cancerous. But it’s still serious and aggressive. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma can spread from your nasal cavity into your sinuses, skull and
brain
. Without treatment, JNA may lead to life-threatening complications or death. That’s why it’s so important to tell a healthcare provider if something doesn’t seem right. The good news is that treatment can help get rid of the tumor.
Juvenile angiofibroma is most common in
males
between the ages of 10 and 25. Very rarely, it may occur in males over 25 or as young as 7. JNA almost never affects females.
Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is very rare. Experts estimate it occurs in
1 in every 150,000 to 1,500,000 people
.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of JNA
JNA symptoms aren’t immediate. They often start once the tumor grows large enough to interfere with nasal airflow. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma symptoms may include:
Frequent
nosebleeds
that can be difficult to stop
Trouble breathing through your nose
Facial swelling
Headaches
Vision
or
hearing
changes

JNA causes
Researchers don’t fully understand what causes juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Because these tumors occur almost exclusively in males,
hormones
likely play a role. Experts don’t believe JNA tumors run in families.
Risk factors
There aren’t a lot of clear-cut risk factors for JNA. Even though the condition isn’t hereditary, you’re more likely to develop JNA if one of your biological family members has another condition called
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
. Experts continue to explore the relationship between these two conditions.
Complications of JNA
If JNA grows, it can press on surrounding facial structures and cause complications like:
Bulging eyes
Vision loss
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
A healthcare provider can diagnose JNA during an
examination
. They’ll look at your nose and ask about your symptoms. They’ll likely need to run tests, which may include:
Imaging tests, like
CT scans
,
PET scans
or an
MRI
Nasal endoscopy
They may also refer you to an
otolaryngologist
(ENT) to run more tests or confirm the diagnosis.
Management and Treatment
How is JNA treated?
Healthcare providers use surgery and radiation therapy to treat JNA.
Surgery
Surgical removal of the tumor is the go-to JNA treatment. A surgeon uses an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera) to do the procedure through your nostrils. That way, they can avoid making cuts (incisions) on the outside of your nose.
In some cases, surgeons might need to make external incisions. If that happens, they’ll make them as small as possible to minimize
scarring
.
As your nose contains so many blood vessels, providers usually do a procedure called embolization beforehand.
Embolization
helps prevent blood loss during surgery.
Radiation therapy
It can be hard for surgeons to remove tissue that’s grown into surrounding bone and/or sinuses. If tiny bits of tissue are left behind, the tumor may come back. If that happens, your surgeon might recommend repeat surgery or
radiation therapy
.
According to some
research studies
, JNA comes back in up to 37% of cases.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Keep an eye on sudden symptoms like nasal stuffiness or frequent nosebleeds. You know your body better than anyone else. Be sure to tell a healthcare provider when something doesn’t seem right to you.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have JNA?
JNA has a high survival rate. The outlook is good with treatment.
Because JNA can come back, there’s a chance you might need radiation therapy or an additional surgery in the future. Your healthcare provider can check in with you periodically and recommend treatment if necessary.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) isn’t cancer. But it still requires prompt treatment. Because the tumor can grow into nearby areas quickly, it’s important to remove it as soon as possible. Talk to your healthcare provider about what to expect.
