Endothelin
Endothelin is a peptide (protein) that constricts your blood vessels. If your body makes too much of it, you may develop high blood pressure, as well as heart and lung issues. Researchers are studying all the ways endothelin affects your health. They’re also looking into medications to treat conditions related to endothelin issues.

Overview
What is endothelin?
Endothelin (ET) is a natural peptide that helps manage your
blood pressure
by narrowing your blood vessels. This reduces blood flow through your vessels. Peptides are small proteins made up of short chains of
amino acids
.

Medical researchers first identified endothelin in 1987. Since then, they’ve uncovered many key functions of this peptide throughout your body. They’re also studying how excess endothelin can lead to several health issues, like
heart failure
and
pulmonary hypertension
.

Function
What does endothelin do?
Endothelins are your body’s most powerful vasoconstrictor.
Vasoconstriction
is the process of narrowing your blood vessels to slow blood flow. This increases your blood pressure. Sometimes, a temporary increase in pressure is helpful to your body. But long-term high blood pressure causes health issues.
Scientists are studying many other roles of endothelins. Other than vasoconstriction, they also play a part in:
Blood vessel structural changes (remodeling)
Cognitive functioning
Fetal development
Immune system
regulation
Melanin
production
Nerve formation
Ovulation
Scar tissue formation (fibrosis)
Several situations can trigger the release of endothelin, including:
A
lack of oxygen
in body tissues
A release of
hormones
that manage blood pressure
Injury and inflammation
Pressure on your blood vessels, like during an
angioplasty
procedure
Most tissues throughout your body have endothelin receptors. Endothelin binds to these receptors to trigger various reactions.

Types
So far, scientists have found three types of endothelins. They all play a role in vasoconstriction, but some have other jobs. They include:
Endothelin-1 (ET-1 or EDN1)
: This is the most common and strongest endothelin in your body. Its main job is vasoconstriction.
ET-2 or EDN2
: Your kidneys and intestines mainly make ET-2. This suggests it plays a role in regulating these organs. ET-2 also helps trigger ovulation.
ET-3 or EDN3
: ET-3 helps form certain nerves and produce cells that make melanin. It’s the pigment responsible for your skin, hair and eye color.
Anatomy
Where does endothelin come from?
The cells lining the inside of your blood vessels — the
endothelium
— mainly make endothelin. But other tissues contribute to its production, including:
Brain cells
Intestine cells
Kidney cells
Macrophages
(immune system cells)
Vascular
smooth muscle
cells
Conditions and Disorders
What conditions are related to endothelin?
Long-term elevated levels of endothelin can damage a variety of body tissues and organs. Healthcare providers call it
endothelial dysfunction
. Some examples of conditions it can cause include:
Heart failure
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Certain cancers, especially
ovarian cancer
Post-menopausal hypertension (PMH)
Preeclampsia
Kidney disease, like
diabetes-related nephropathy
Pulmonary hypertension
Additional Common Questions
What are endothelin receptor antagonists?
Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) are medications that lower the amount of endothelin in your body. They bind to endothelin receptors and block endothelin from attaching and working. ERAs can help treat certain types of pulmonary hypertension. Researchers are also testing them for the treatment of
immunoglobin A nephropathy (IgAN)
, a type of kidney disease.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Scientists continue to learn more about endothelin every day. While it plays a major role in constricting your blood vessels, it does many other things, too. You likely won’t hear your healthcare provider mention this term unless they prescribe an endothelin receptor antagonist. If they say something you don’t understand, don’t hesitate to ask questions.
