T — Tetanus:
Tetanus (lockjaw) causes painful muscle stiffening, especially around your neck and jaw. It can lead to trouble opening your mouth, difficulty breathing and swallowing, and even death.
d — Diphtheria:
Diphtheria
causes a thick coating to form in the back of your throat. This can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis or death.
ap — Acellular Pertussis:
Pertussis (whooping cough)
causes violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe, eat or drink. It can be life-threatening for babies and young children.
The Tdap vaccine is a combination vaccine. That means it contains more than one vaccine in the same shot. The Tdap vaccine is only for children ages 7 and older, adolescents and adults.
What are the differences between the DTaP vaccine, DT vaccine, Tdap vaccine and Td vaccine?
The differences between the vaccines are in which infections they prevent, what age group can get them and other indications.

What do the uppercase and lowercase letters mean in the vaccine names?
Uppercase letters mean the vaccine has a full-strength dose of that part of the vaccine. The lowercase “d” and “p” in Tdap mean the vaccine uses smaller doses of diphtheria and pertussis.
The “a” in Tdap is an abbreviation for “acellular.” Acellular means the vaccine contains only part of the pertussis bacteria instead of the whole bacteria.
Who should get the Tdap vaccine?
The Tdap vaccine is for anyone ages 7 and older. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the following:
