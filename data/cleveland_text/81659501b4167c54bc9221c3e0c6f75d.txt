A septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure. Healthcare providers use it to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a thickened heart muscle. During surgery, your provider removes a portion of thickened heart tissue to improve blood flow through your heart. Septal myectomy successfully treats hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in most people.

Overview
What is a septal myectomy?
A septal myectomy is an open-heart surgery to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a thickened heart muscle. During the procedure, your surgeon removes a portion of thickened heart tissue. This allows blood to flow through your heart more easily.

How does hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affect my heart?
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
makes it more difficult for your heart to circulate
blood through your body
.
Your
heart
has four chambers:
Left and right chambers on the top (atria).
Left and right chambers on the bottom (ventricles).
A band of muscle called the septum separates your two ventricles. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum thickens and may bulge into your left heart ventricle. This bulging blocks blood flow, meaning your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your body. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be a
congenital heart disease
, meaning you’re born with it. You can also develop it later in life.
Who is a candidate for a septal myectomy?
Healthcare providers usually recommend a septal myectomy for people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and whose symptoms haven’t improved with medications. They may also recommend it for:
People with severe thickening into their left ventricle.
People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who want to become pregnant, even if they don’t have severe symptoms.
Treatment Details
What happens before a septal myectomy?
Your healthcare provider will give you instructions to prepare for a septal myectomy. Most people don’t need to do anything special. You may need to stop taking certain medicines, such as blood thinners, before the operation. If you smoke, your provider may ask you to try to stop before surgery.

Before surgery, you’ll have to have tests that check your heart health such as:
Blood tests.
Cardiac catheterization
.
Cardiac MRIs
.
Chest X-rays
.
Echocardiograms
Electrocardiograms
.
What happens during a septal myectomy?
You’ll receive general anesthesia before the procedure starts.
Anesthesia
helps you remain in a deep sleep through the operation and not feel any pain.
After you’re asleep, your surgeon:
Makes a large incision down the middle of your chest and separates your breastbone (sternum) to reach your heart.
Connects you to a heart-lung machine that takes over the work of your heart and lungs during surgery.
Removes the thickened portion of your septum.
Disconnects the heart-lung machine.
Puts your breastbone back together and closes the incision with absorbable sutures.
How long does a septal myectomy surgery take?
A septal myectomy usually takes between three and four hours.
What happens after a septal myectomy?
You recover in the intensive care unit (ICU) immediately after a septal myectomy. You may have a urine catheter or chest drainage tube in place for 24 to 48 hours.
You’ll start walking with help from a physical therapist after around 48 hours. Most people recover in the hospital for fewer than five days.
