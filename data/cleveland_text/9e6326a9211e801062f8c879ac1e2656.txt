Cupping Therapy
Cupping therapy is an ancient healing method that may ease back pain, neck pain, headaches and other issues. It uses suction to pull on your skin and increase blood flow to the affected area. Cupping causes bruising and can lead to skin infection. There’s mixed evidence on the benefits of cupping, but the treatment risks are generally low.

Overview
Cupping therapy uses the force of suction to pull blood toward the surface of your skin. The idea is to increase your body’s natural healing response in these areas.
What is cupping therapy?
Cupping therapy is an ancient healing technique that some people use to ease pain. A provider places cups on your back, stomach, arms, legs or other parts of your body. A vacuum or suction force inside the cup pulls your
skin
upward.

Treatment Details
How does cupping work?
Experts are still exploring how cupping eases pain and disease symptoms. There isn’t a lot of research on the therapy.
Suction from cupping draws fluid into the treated area. This suction force expands and breaks open tiny
blood vessels
(capillaries) under your skin. Your body replenishes the cupped areas with healthier blood flow and stimulates proper and normal healing at a cellular level. Because of this effect, some people think that cupping releases toxins.

How do healthcare providers perform cupping?
There are different ways to do cupping. The steps vary slightly depending on the chosen method. Your provider will leave the cups in place for several minutes. Some treatments involve briefly moving the cups to stretch and massage the area.
Cupping methods include:
Dry:
Your provider heats the inside of each cup. The traditional method involves setting an alcohol-soaked cotton ball aflame. The heat sends oxygen out of the cup, creating a vacuum. A more modern approach involves using a suction device to remove air from the cups. The vacuum force pulls your skin up into the cup.
Running:
This is like dry cupping. But before beginning, your provider will apply lotion or oil to your skin. Once they place the cups, they’ll gently move them in different directions over the affected area of your body.
Bleeding:
Your provider uses a needle to lightly puncture your skin before placing the cups. This allows for the release of toxins through the suctioned blood captured in the cup.
Depending on the treatment, your provider may place multiple cups on your skin. On average, providers use between three and five cups, though they might use up to seven. It’s uncommon to get more than seven cups in a single treatment.
What type of cups do they use?
Most providers use glass or plastic cups, but cups may also be:
Bamboo.
Ceramic.
Metal.
Silicone.
What should I expect after cupping?
The suction force from cupping breaks open tiny blood vessels called
capillaries
under your skin. You’ll have red, round cupping therapy marks that should fade in a week or two. Although these marks will look like bruises, they’re not true bruises that injure muscle fibers.
Does cupping hurt?
Cupping shouldn’t cause pain, though you may experience some skin tightness during the procedure. After cupping therapy, you may feel bruised and slightly sore, but you shouldn’t have severe discomfort.
Who performs cupping therapy?
A variety of healthcare providers can receive training to perform cupping, including:
Acupuncturists
.
Chiropractors
.
Massage therapists.
Medical doctors.
Physical therapists

Recovery and Outlook
How effective is cupping?
There’s mixed evidence about the effectiveness of cupping. Experts note many different reasons why cupping might work. In fact, the success of cupping may result from a combination of these reasons.
For example, cupping therapy might:
Encourage whole-body comfort and relaxation.
Increase your pain threshold.
Reduce
inflammation
.
Enhance blood circulation.
Remove toxins from your body.
Reduce cholesterol and
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
.
Help prevent cardiovascular diseases like

Most healthcare providers recommend cupping as a
complementary medicine
treatment. In other words, you should use it in combination with traditional Western medicine rather than as a stand-alone procedure.
