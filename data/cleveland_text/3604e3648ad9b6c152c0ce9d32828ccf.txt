The cause of stress.
How you feel physically and emotionally.
Your reaction to the stressor.

Relaxation techniques
Laugh more:
Studies show that laughing reduces the stress hormone cortisol. And it boosts your mood. Watch a funny show, or get together with someone who makes you laugh.
Calm your mind:
Mindfulness,
meditation
, massage and deep breathing exercises can lower your heart rate and calm your mind. You can also listen to your favorite tunes or to soothing sounds.
Physical techniques
Be physically active:
Walking outside or exercising with friends can help boost mood. You can also try mindful physical exercises like yoga or tai chi.
Eat a healthy diet:
Aim for more fresh fruits and vegetables. Cut back on fatty foods,
caffeine
and sugar.
Improve your sleep habits:
Turn off electronics, create a soothing environment and unwind with a book or warm bath to
sleep
better.
Stop using substances:
Quit smoking
and cut back on alcohol. Call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association national helpline at
1.800.662.HELP (4357)
if you need help overcoming a substance use disorder.
Cognitive techniques
Keep a journal:
Write down the day’s accomplishments. You can also capture positive events of the day or three things you’re grateful for.
Make “me time”:
Try to do at least one thing a day that’s just for you. It could be meditating, getting together with a friend, reading a book or working on a hobby.
Seek help:
A mental health professional can help you learn techniques to manage stress better.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) is a proven technique that can help you change how you respond to life stressors.
Share your feelings:
When you feel overwhelmed, connect with a trusted loved one or friend. Hearing a voice can help, either in-person or on the phone.
Take control:
Use lists or smartphone apps to better manage your time and pare down to-dos. Try planning your day the evening before, so you know what to expect — and what you might need to postpone. Give yourself permission to say no to other people’s requests.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Stress is a natural and normal part of everyone’s life. You can’t completely eliminate stress — some stressors will always be out of your control. But you can use stress management techniques to handle how you respond to stressful situations. Talking to your healthcare provider is a good first step to finding healthful ways to minimize stress. If appropriate, your provider can refer you to a therapist or prescribe medications for anxiety or other stress-induced health problems.
