Balance Problems
Balance problems happen when your brain can’t process signals from your eyes, ears and body correctly. You might feel dizzy or off-balance, but treatment or physical therapy can often restore stability.

What Are Balance Problems?
Balance problems, also known as balance disorders, can make you feel unsteady or dizzy. Balance helps you stay steady when you walk, stand or move. To do that, your body relies on signals from your eyes, inner ears, muscles and brain. These systems work together to tell you where you are in space and how to stay upright. When something disrupts that process, you might feel wobbly or off-balance.

Balance issues often point to another health problem. Treating the cause — and sometimes, doing physical therapy — can help you feel steady again.
How your body maintains balance
Balance depends on how your senses and
nervous system
work together.
Here’s how it works:
Inner ears
(vestibular system)
: Sense motion and gravity through canals and tiny organs in your ears
Eyes
(vision)
: Track your surroundings to help your brain know where your body is in space
Skin
,
joints
and
muscles
: Send signals about pressure and movement (for example, if you lean back, pressure in your heels tells your brain you’re off balance)
Your
brain
uses all this input to keep you balanced. If something goes wrong, it may not process the signals right, and you might feel dizzy or off.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of balance problems
Balance problems feel different depending on the cause. You may notice:
Blurred vision
: Trouble seeing clearly, especially when moving
Dizziness
: A woozy or disoriented feeling
Lightheadedness
: Feeling faint or like you might pass out
Unsteadiness
: Feeling wobbly when you stand or walk
Vertigo
: A spinning feeling, even when you’re still
These symptoms can come on fast or slowly. Some people feel them only in certain situations, like when standing up quickly or being in a crowded place.

Balance problem causes
Many things can affect your balance. It’s more common with age, but it can happen to anyone. Causes usually fall into two groups: inner ear problems and other health conditions.
Inner ear disorders
Your inner ear plays a major role in helping you stay balanced. Conditions that affect this area include:
Acoustic neuroma
: A
noncancerous tumor
on the
nerve
that helps with hearing and balance
BPPV
(benign paroxysmal positional vertigo)
: Short bursts of dizziness when you move your head, like when lying down or rolling over in bed
Labyrinthitis
: Swelling in the inner ear, which affects balance and hearing
Ménière’s disease
: Sudden dizziness, often with hearing loss, ear pressure and
ringing in the ear
PPPD
(persistent postural perceptual dizziness)
: Ongoing dizziness triggered by motion, crowds or screens
Vestibular neuritis
: Swelling in a nerve that helps your brain process balance signals
Other health conditions
Balance issues can also result from a wide range of health problems, including:
Head injuries
: Concussions or brain injuries can affect balance short- or long-term.
Heart disease
: Poor blood flow may cause dizziness or fainting.
Migraines
: These can cause dizziness during episodes.
Motion sickness
: Travel or screen time can trigger dizziness and nausea.
Neurological disorders
: Diseases like
Parkinson’s
or
Alzheimer’s
can affect balance control.
Orthostatic hypotension
: This is a sudden blood pressure drop when you stand up.
Peripheral neuropathy
: Nerve damage in hands or feet affects your body’s signals.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Your provider will start with a
physical exam
and ask about your symptoms. They may do
vestibular tests
to see how your eyes, ears and brain work together to keep you balanced.
Here are some of the most common tests:
DVA (dynamic visual acuity test)
: You read while your head is still and again while moving to see how motion affects your vision.
mCTSIB (Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance)
: You stand on different surfaces with your eyes open and closed to test balance.
Rotary chair test
: You sit in a turning chair while goggles measure your eye and ear response.
vHIT (Video Head Impulse Test)
: You focus on a target while your provider quickly moves your head. Goggles track your eyes.
VEMP (vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials)
: You hear sounds while sensors track how your neck or eye muscles respond.
VNG
(videonystagmography)
: You’ll wear goggles that track your eyes while you follow a moving object.
Management and Treatment
How are balance issues treated?
Treatment depends on the cause of your balance problems. Your provider will treat that condition, whether it’s in your ear, brain or somewhere else.
They may also suggest
vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)
— a special kind of physical therapy that uses
exercises to improve balance
and reduce dizziness.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you often feel unsteady or off balance, talk to your healthcare provider. It’s especially important to let them know if your symptoms aren’t improving with treatment — or if they’re getting worse. You could be dealing with an underlying issue that needs a different approach. In some cases, you may need adjustments or updates to your care plan to help you feel more stable and safe.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have balance problems?
Your provider will help you through diagnosis and treatment. If a health issue is causing your balance problems, they’ll focus on treating that first.
You may also need therapy to help your brain and body adjust. Recovery takes time, but with care, most people feel better and more confident.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Feeling off balance once in a while is common. But if it keeps happening, it may be a sign of something else. Ongoing balance issues can be frustrating and affect your quality of life. Don’t wait — talk to your provider. With the right care, you can feel steadier and more in control.
