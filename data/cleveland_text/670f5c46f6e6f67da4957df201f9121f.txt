SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a respiratory illness caused by the virus SARS-CoV-1. It caused an outbreak of severe illness in several countries between 2002 and 2003. Symptoms included high fever, cough and shortness of breath. No cases have been reported since 2004.

What Is SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)?
People with SARS had flu-like symptoms. Some people developed a cough and shortness of breath a few days later.
SARS (SARS-CoV-1) was a respiratory illness that spread in many countries around the world in 2002 and 2003. For many people, SARS caused
flu-like symptoms
(like fever and headache). But it progressed to severe illness in about 1 to 2 out of every 10 people (10% to 20%) during the outbreak.

Policy
More than 8,000 people in 29 countries had SARS between 2002 and 2003. There was a small outbreak related to occupational exposure in 2004. Preventive measures stopped its spread, and only nine people were infected. There haven’t been any reported cases since then.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of SARS?
Symptoms of SARS include:
Persistent, high
fever
Chills
Headache
Body aches
Cough
Shortness of breath
Diarrhea
Sore throat
Some people only have a fever and other flu-like symptoms. Others develop a cough and shortness of breath two to seven days after their initial symptoms started.
SARS causes
A
virus
, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), causes SARS. Viruses are small pieces of genetic material (
DNA
or RNA) enclosed in a protective coating. They use your cells’ machinery to make more copies of themselves, which makes you sick.
How does SARS spread?
SARS spreads through respiratory droplets, usually when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes. You can also get it by touching contaminated surfaces. Surfaces can become contaminated when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes on them or touches them without washing their hands.
What happens if you get SARS?
SARS no longer spreads. But during the 2002-2003 epidemic, some people had mild illness and others had severe complications, like:

Pneumonia
Low oxygen levels in their blood and tissues (
hypoxia
)
Respiratory failure
People who were severely ill were put on
mechanical ventilation
if they couldn’t breathe on their own.
People with mild symptoms could treat themselves with pain relievers and fever reducers — much the same way you’d take care of yourself with a cold or
the flu
.
Management and Treatment
Can the SARS virus be cured?
No, there isn’t a cure for SARS. And like many viruses, there aren’t any specific
antiviral medications
that treat it.

Prevention
Can SARS be prevented?
In general, you can reduce the risk of spreading viruses (like SARS) and other
infectious diseases
by:
Washing your hands frequently
Avoiding others when you’re sick
Wearing a mask if you need to be around people when you’re sick or could be sick
Covering your mouth and nose with your elbow when you cough or sneeze
Additional Common Questions
How many people died from SARS?
At the end of the SARS epidemic in 2003, 916 people had died from the disease. One person died during a small outbreak in 2004.
Are COVID and SARS the same?
No,
COVID-19
and SARS are different illnesses caused by different viruses. They’re both respiratory illnesses caused by coronaviruses, which is why the viruses have similar names (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses can also cause mild respiratory illnesses, like
common colds
.
COVID-19 spreads more easily and has infected far more people than SARS did. COVID-19 also seems to spread more easily before symptoms start (in SARS, people were most contagious after symptoms started).
How did we stop the spread of SARS?
Public health measures helped contain SARS. Scientists collaborated to quickly identify and find ways to test for the virus. SARS is most contagious after symptoms start, so screening people with symptoms and isolating them at home was effective at containing the spread.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Outbreaks of any illness can cause uncertainty and anxiety. SARS caused mild and severe illness and hundreds of deaths. But cooperation among scientists, healthcare providers and members of the affected communities helped limit the number of people who got sick. Health officials across multiple countries were able to work quickly to identify the virus and contain its spread. There haven’t been cases of SARS since 2004.
