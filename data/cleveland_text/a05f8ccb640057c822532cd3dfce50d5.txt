Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)
Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are viruses and bacteria that infect your respiratory tract above your vocal cords. Symptoms can include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat or headache. Common colds, strep throat and sinus infections are all examples of upper respiratory infections. Most URIs are caused by viruses and go away on their own.

A runny nose, sore throat, headache and other cold-like symptoms might come to mind when you think of an upper respiratory infection. And it’s true —
common colds
and other
viruses
are usually to blame for URIs. But some URIs, like
strep throat
or some cases of
sinusitis
, are
bacterial infections
. Still others, like the viruses responsible for the flu, COVID-19 and RSV, can cause both upper and lower respiratory infections.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection?
Symptoms of upper respiratory infections depend on the cause and what part of your body is affected. Infections can lead to swelling in parts of your respiratory tract, causing conditions like
pharyngitis
,
laryngitis
and
epiglottitis
, which can have different symptoms.
Symptoms of upper respiratory infections can include:
Fever
Sore throat
Cough
Runny or stuffy nose
Sneezing
Hoarse voice
or loss of voice
Fatigue
Facial pain
Wheezing
Swollen lymph nodes
What causes upper respiratory tract infections?
Viruses cause most upper respiratory infections. But
bacteria
and even
fungi
can cause them, too. Specific causes can include:
Common cold viruses
Influenza A and B virus (
the flu
)
SARS-CoV-2 virus (
COVID-19
)
Respiratory syncytial virus (
RSV
)
Varicella-zoster virus
Herpes simplex virus
Streptococcus bacteria, like
group A strep
and
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenza
bacteria
Moraxella catarrhalis
bacteria
Aspergillus
,
mucormycetes
and other types of fungi

Are upper respiratory infections contagious?
Yes, the viruses and bacteria that cause upper respiratory infections are contagious (spread from person to person). They can spread through:
Respiratory droplets, when someone coughs, sneezes or talks
Sharing eating or drinking utensils (like forks, spoons, cups or water bottles)
Contact with objects or surfaces with germs on them (think doorknobs, light switches, phones or toys)
Fungi that cause upper respiratory infections aren’t contagious.
What are the complications of upper respiratory tract infections?
Upper respiratory infections like colds rarely lead to complications. But URIs can sometimes cause inflammation in your lungs, leading to
pneumonia
. Additionally, if bacterial or fungal infections are left untreated, they can travel to other parts of your body and cause:
Meningitis
Rheumatic fever
Scarlet fever
Sepsis
Organ damage
You might be at higher risk for complications from a URI if you have certain health conditions or a
compromised immune system
, or if you’re older than 65. Newborns are also at higher risk for severe illness.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are upper respiratory tract infections diagnosed?
Healthcare providers usually diagnose upper respiratory infections based on your symptoms and
nasal swab
or
throat culture
. If your symptoms are mild and your tests are negative for infections like the flu or strep throat, you might have one of hundreds of common cold viruses, which providers don’t often test for.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat upper respiratory tract infections?
Treatment for upper respiratory infections depends on the cause. There aren’t any specific treatments for most viral URIs, like colds. Providers treat bacterial infections, like strep throat, with
antibiotics
.

Outlook / Prognosis
How can I get rid of an upper respiratory infection fast?
Most viral URIs have to run their course and go away on their own. They usually last one to two weeks. You can ease your symptoms by drinking plenty of water and taking over-the-counter medications.
If you have a bacterial infection, your symptoms should start to improve a day or two after starting antibiotics. Don’t stop taking antibiotics even if you feel better — make sure you take the entire course as prescribed.
How long are you contagious with an upper respiratory infection?
Upper respiratory infections caused by viruses are usually most contagious in the first few days of symptoms, and sometimes, a day or two before they start. But you could still be contagious even when you start to feel better, especially if you still have symptoms. Strep throat can be contagious for weeks if left untreated.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact a healthcare provider if your symptoms:
Are severe
Last longer than two weeks
Come back frequently
Long-lasting or frequent symptoms could be signs of a bacterial infection, fungal infection or other health condition. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have a compromised immune system or other health condition that might put you at higher risk for severe illness if you get an URI.

When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room if you experience signs of severe illness, including:
High fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius)
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Noisy breathing, like wheezing or
stridor
Dizziness
Retractions
, when your skin between your ribs pulls in when you breathe
Confusion
or other mental changes
Prevention
Can upper respiratory tract infections be prevented?
You can reduce your risk of getting or spreading upper respiratory infections by:
Getting all recommended
vaccinations
Washing your hands frequently
Disinfecting surfaces
Not sharing food, utensils or cups
Wearing a mask if you must be around people when you’re sick
Additional Common Questions
Do you need antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection?
Most of the time, no. Antibiotics don’t work on viruses, the cause of most URIs. You only need antibiotics if your provider diagnoses you with a bacterial infection, like strep throat.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
The sore throat. The stuffy head. The seemingly endless runny nose. We all know that familiar upper respiratory infection (URI) feeling. Fortunately, most upper respiratory infections aren’t serious. But it doesn’t hurt to have a box of tissues, a humidifier and your favorite show or book at the ready for when one comes up. If you have any concerns about your symptoms, or you think you could have a bacterial infection, talk to a healthcare provider.
