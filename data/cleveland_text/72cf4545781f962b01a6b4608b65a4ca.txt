Psittacosis
Psittacosis is a disease you get from contact with birds infected with Chlamydia psittaci bacteria. It usually infects your lungs, causing symptoms like fever, cough and muscle pain. It sometimes causes serious lung infections or spreads to other parts of your body. Antibiotics can cure most cases of psittacosis in people.

bacterial infection
you can get from birds. It’s caused by the bacteria

Psittacosis (pronounced “sit-ah-COH-sis”) is also called “ornithosis” or “parrot fever” (though you can get it from many types of birds, not just parrots).
Is psittacosis the same as human chlamydia?
No, psittacosis is caused by a different bacteria species than the one that causes
chlamydia
in humans.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of psittacosis?
Symptoms of psittacosis in humans can be mild or severe and include:
Fever
.
Cough.
Muscle pain
.
Headaches and body aches.
Nausea or vomiting.
Diarrhea.
Rash (less common).
What causes psittacosis?
Chlamydia psittaci
(
C. psittaci
) bacteria cause psittacosis. The
bacteria
come out in an infected bird’s poop and respiratory fluids. When these fluids dry, they can release bacteria into the air as dust. It spreads between birds through the contaminated dust or direct contact.
What kind of birds get psittacosis?
All types of birds can get and spread psittacosis, including:
Birds kept as pets, like parrots, parakeets, cockatiels and cockatoos.
Farm birds or fowl, like chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys.
Other wild birds, like pigeons and gulls.
How do you get psittacosis?
You get psittacosis from close contact with infected birds and breathing in dust contaminated with their poop or respiratory fluids. Less commonly, a bird can infect you by biting you or touching their beak to your mouth. You’re very unlikely to get psittacosis from an infected person.

What are the risk factors for psittacosis?
You’re at higher risk for psittacosis if you have a job or hobbies that put you in close contact with pet birds or fowl. This includes people who have pet birds or who work:
On a poultry farm or in poultry processing.
In a veterinary office that treats birds.
In a pet shop that sells birds.
What are the complications of psittacosis?
Psittacosis bacteria can cause serious lung infections or spread to other parts of your body. Complications include:
Pneumonia
.
Myocarditis
.
Endocarditis
.
Encephalitis
.
Hepatitis (liver inflammation).
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is psittacosis diagnosed?
Psittacosis can be hard to diagnose from body fluid samples. It can also take a long time to grow the bacteria and confirm a diagnosis. Because of this, providers usually diagnose you based on your symptoms and history of bird exposure. They may also take samples to send to a lab to look for signs of bacteria. Samples could include:
Sputum (mucus coughed up from your lungs).
Blood
.
Mucus swabbed from your nose or throat
.
Your provider may recommend other tests, like
chest X-rays
, depending on your symptoms.
Management and Treatment
Is there a cure for psittacosis?
Yes, antibiotics can cure psittacosis. Antibiotics that providers usually prescribe to treat it include doxycycline or tetracycline. If those don’t work or aren’t an option, alternatives include:
Erythromycin.
Azithromycin.
Chloramphenicol.
Rifampin.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have psittacosis?
Most people with psittacosis make a full recovery if treated properly. You’ll need to take all of your antibiotics — usually for about two weeks — as prescribed by your provider. Make sure to take them exactly as recommended, even after you feel better.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See a healthcare provider if you think you could have psittacosis. It’s important to tell your provider about any contact you have with birds, including:
Handling pet birds, chickens, turkeys or other birds.
Working around their cages or enclosures.
Cleaning up after them.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of severe illness, including:
High fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius).
Difficulty breathing
.
Chest pain
.
Bluish skin, lips or nails (
cyanosis
).
Confusion.
Seizures
.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:
How do I take my medications?
How long will it take to feel better?
When should I follow up with you?
What new or worsening symptoms should I look out for?
How can I prevent this in the future?
Prevention
Can you prevent psittacosis?
If you’re around birds, you can reduce your risk of psittacosis by practicing safe bird handling and cleaning habits, including:
Washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handing birds or cleaning up after them.
Buying pet birds only from reputable sources.
Isolating infected birds from other birds. Have a veterinarian treat them and get guidance on when it’s safe for them to be around other birds again.
Not crowding too many birds in one cage or enclosure.
Cleaning bird cages and changing their food and water bowls daily. Wet surfaces before cleaning to avoid releasing dust into the air.
Setting up bird cages or enclosures to avoid spreading infections through contaminated food, feathers and poop. Don’t stack cages and use solid barriers between cages that are next to each other.

Additional Common Questions
How do I know if my bird has psittacosis?
Signs of psittacosis in birds include:
Loose droppings/diarrhea.
Puffy, watery eyes.
Nasal discharge/runny nose.
Ruffled or unkempt feathers.
Poor appetite/eating less.
Some birds have no symptoms of psittacosis but can still spread it. A veterinarian that specializes in birds can diagnose and treat psittacosis in birds.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Psittacosis is a bacterial infection that can sometimes make you seriously ill. If you live or work around birds, you can reduce your risk — and your birds’ risk — of getting sick with careful cleaning and safe bird handling practices. See a provider if you think you have psittacosis. Early treatment is important for keeping both you and any feathered friends healthy.
