What are marionette lines?
Marionette lines, also called melomental folds, are creases that extend from the corners of your
mouth
to your chin. The name comes from marionette string puppets, which have pronounced vertical lines in the same place.

nose
to the mouth. Marionette lines appear below nasolabial folds.
Who typically gets marionette lines?

wrinkles
.
What age do marionette lines appear?
Marionette lines typically appear around age 40. But you may see faint or subtle lines at the corners of your mouth in your 20s and 30s.

Diagnosis and Tests
How are marionette lines diagnosed?
Your
dermatologist
or cosmetic surgeon may use a five-point rating scale to diagnose the severity of the marionette lines. The rating scale can help your surgeon determine the best treatment option.
Management and Treatment
What is the best treatment for marionette lines?
The best way to treat marionette lines differs for each person. Together with your healthcare provider, you’ll decide which option is best for you based on your:
Current health.
Desire for any additional skin changes.
Goals and expectations.
Severity of marionette lines.
What are the treatment options for minimizing marionette lines?
You can minimize marionette lines with various
cosmetic procedures
and treatments. Most of these options don’t require surgery or incisions.
Instead, healthcare providers use injections, peels, lasers and threads to minimize marionette lines. But these cosmetic treatments are temporary. The effects will wear off, and you’ll require additional sessions.
Treatment options include:
Botox
.
Chemical peels
.
Dermal fillers
.
Laser skin resurfacing
.
Microneedling (collagen induction therapy), which increases the production of collagen to add volume and improve lines.
Thread lift
.
What is the best filler for marionette lines?
Dermal fillers temporarily add volume to your face to smooth out lines and wrinkles. There isn’t one filler that’s best for marionette lines. In general, dermal fillers may help with mild to moderate marionette lines. But they might also create an unnatural look.
Can surgery get rid of marionette lines?
If you have deeper marionette lines, your healthcare provider may recommend a full or mini-facelift (
rhytidectomy
). During a full or mini-facelift, your surgeon makes incisions to remove and lift your skin. This surgery requires a longer recovery than the other options for marionette lines, such as fillers or injections.
