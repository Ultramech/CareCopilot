Neurofibroma
Neurofibromas are benign nerve tumors that are often linked to neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder. They can show up on your skin or deeper in your body. While most don’t cause issues, larger ones might need surgery if they press on nerves or organs. These tumors often appear during adolescence.

What Is a Neurofibroma?
A neurofibroma is a
noncancerous tumor
that may feel like a soft bump on your
skin
. These tumors grow on
nerves
. Some appear just under your skin’s surface. Some form deeper in your body.

Most neurofibromas don’t cause serious problems. But large
tumors
can press on nerves or organs and cause pain or other issues. A small percentage can turn cancerous over time. In those cases, you may need surgery.
Types of neurofibromas
There are different types of neurofibromas:
Cutaneous neurofibromas
are soft, skin-colored bumps. They usually appear in adults between ages 20 and 40. They may itch or hurt when touched.
Diffuse neurofibromas
often grow on your head or neck. They can make your skin thicker and cause numbness or tingling.
Plexiform neurofibromas
are larger tumors that usually begin in childhood. They may press on nearby nerves or your spine, causing pain, numbness or weakness. These neurofibromas can sometimes turn cancerous over time, so your doctor may monitor them more closely.
Symptoms and Causes
Neurofibroma symptoms
Neurofibromas don’t always cause symptoms. When they do, it depends on the type and location. Some are small and painless. Others can press on nearby nerves or tissues, causing more noticeable problems.
Neurofibromas on your skin may cause:
A bump (often the same color as your surrounding skin)
Bleeding
Pain
Neurofibromas that press on nerves might result in:
Numbness
Pain
Tingling
Weakness
Talk to a provider if you notice changes. While many neurofibromas are harmless, some can affect your comfort or daily activities. A healthcare provider can help you understand what’s typical and what may need treatment.

Neurofibroma causes
Neurofibromas most often form because of a
genetic condition
called
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
. NF1 happens because of changes (
variations
) in genes that control how cells grow. It affects about
1 in every 3,000 children
. Providers usually diagnose it in kids aged 10 or younger.
You can inherit NF1 from a biological parent, but not always. In about half of all cases, the gene change happens by chance (sporadically), not through inheritance. When this happens, symptoms are often milder.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Healthcare providers usually start with a
physical exam
. They’ll check your skin for bumps and ask about your symptoms and biological family history.
To get more information, they may order imaging tests like:
CT scan
or
MRI
:
These show where the tumors are, how big they are and if they’re pressing on nearby tissues or organs.
PET scan
:
This can help tell if a tumor is noncancerous (benign) or might be cancerous (malignant). Surgeons may use this to guide them during a biopsy.
These tests help your provider get a clearer picture of what’s going on and determine the best treatment plan for your needs. If you’re feeling anxious or unsure, don’t hesitate to ask questions. Understanding your diagnosis is the first step in managing it with confidence.
Management and Treatment
How is neurofibroma treated?
Neurofibroma treatment depends on the size, type and symptoms of the tumor. Many neurofibromas don’t need immediate care and can be monitored over time with regular check-ups. But if a tumor is painful or growing, surgery is often recommended.
Surgery is typically used when a tumor presses on nerves, organs or bones. Providers aim to remove the tumor without damaging nearby tissue, which is especially important for large or deep tumors that are harder to remove.
Some people also choose surgery to ease discomfort or for cosmetic reasons — especially when small skin bumps affect appearance or quality of life. In general, most neurofibromas don’t require treatment unless they’re causing problems.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Tell a healthcare provider if you notice:
A new lump or a lump that’s changing
Bleeding from or around a tumor
Pain or discomfort
Tingling, numbness or weakness
If your tumors affect your daily life or how you feel about your body, let your provider know. They can help you explore treatment options.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have neurofibroma?
Most neurofibromas don’t come back after they’re removed. But new ones can still appear over time. If you see new lumps on your skin, keep an eye on them and tell your provider.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Hearing you have a tumor, even a noncancerous one, can feel overwhelming. The good news is that most neurofibromas don’t cause serious health problems. But some can grow large enough to cause pain or affect how your body works or looks.

If you’re dealing with symptoms or have concerns, talk to your healthcare provider. They’ll walk you through what’s going on and help you understand your options. If a tumor is painful, growing or affecting how you feel about your body, removal could offer relief.
