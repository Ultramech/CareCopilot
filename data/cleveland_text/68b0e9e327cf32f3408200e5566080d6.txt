“Brachioradial” refers to the brachioradialis muscle in the lower part of your arm that helps it bend at your elbow. “
Pruritus
” is the medical term for itching.
Brachioradial pruritus usually affects both arms, but it can occur in only one arm.
What nerve causes brachioradial pruritus?
Irritation of your cervical nerves can lead to brachioradial pruritus. In your neck (
cervical spine
), you have eight pairs of spinal nerves labeled C1 to C8. These nerves supply sensation to your neck, shoulders, arms and hands. Irritation of any of the nerves between C5 and C8 can cause brachioradial pruritus.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of brachioradial pruritus?
The main sign of brachioradial pruritus is itchiness on your outer forearm. The condition doesn’t involve a
skin rash
, but you may develop marks or skin discoloration from excessive scratching.
You may also have itching on your:
Upper arms.
Shoulders.
Neck.
Some people also experience the following sensations in the affected area:
Pain.
Stinging.
Tingling.
In 75% of cases, the itching and other sensations affect both arms. But it can also affect just one arm.
What causes brachioradial pruritus?
Researchers believe a combination of
cervical radiculopathy
and
ultraviolet (UV) radiation
causes brachioradial pruritus.
Cervical radiculopathy
A
pinched nerve
in your neck (cervical radiculopathy) can cause abnormal sensations (
paresthesia
) in various parts of your upper body, including your arms. You may feel tingling, numbness, pain and itching.

Several spinal issues can lead to a pinched nerve in your neck, including:
Herniated disk
.
Osteoarthritis
.
Degenerative disk disease
.
Foraminal stenosis
.
People with brachioradial pruritus often don’t realize they have a pinched nerve in their neck because they often don’t experience pain from it. However, studies show that neck imaging tests of people with brachial pruritus show evidence of spinal issues and pinched nerves.
Ultraviolet radiation exposure
Researchers aren’t exactly sure why, but they believe UV (ultraviolet) radiation is a contributing factor to brachioradial pruritus because:
Many people report increased symptoms with sun exposure.
Brachioradial pruritus is more common in the summer months.
Many people report relief of symptoms during the winter months and with sun protection.
What causes brachioradial pruritus to flare up?
Sun exposure typically triggers flare-ups of brachioradial pruritus. The symptoms are often worse after being outside without sun protection.
What are the risk factors for brachioradial pruritus?
Risk factors for brachioradial pruritus include:
Sex
:
Women
are three times more likely to have brachioradial pruritus than men. This may be because women are more likely to have cervical spine and nerve issues due to their anatomy.
Middle age
: The average age at diagnosis is 59, but it can affect people of other ages.
Light skin type
: The condition more commonly affects people with lighter skin types.
Outdoor lifestyle
: People who develop brachioradial pruritus are typically outdoor enthusiasts, like cyclists, hikers and beach-goers. Some have an extensive history of
sunburn
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is brachioradial pruritus diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms, medical history and lifestyle. They’ll perform a physical exam and assess your arms to be sure you don’t have a rash that’s causing the itching.
Providers can usually diagnose brachioradial pruritus with the ice pack test. Your provider will place an ice pack on the affected area. If your symptoms immediately stop and then return once your provider removes the ice pack, it usually means you have brachioradial pruritus.
In rare cases, your provider may recommend imaging tests to assess your cervical spine and spinal nerves, such as an
MRI scan
or
X-rays
.
What kind of doctor do you see for brachioradial pruritus?
In most cases, a
primary care physician (PCP)
can diagnose brachioradial pruritus and recommend treatment.
But they may refer you to a
neurologist
if your case is severe or there may be other underlying neurological issues.
Management and Treatment
How is brachioradial pruritus treated?
Treatment methods for brachioradial pruritus include:
Avoiding ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure.
Oral medications.
Topical medications.
Using ice packs on the affected area can also alleviate symptoms temporarily.
In very rare cases, healthcare providers may recommend surgery to correct cervical spine conditions.
Avoiding UV radiation exposure
Methods of avoiding UV radiation include:
Reducing the amount of time you spend in the sun.
Using
sunscreen
regularly and reapplying it as necessary.
Wearing UV-protected long-sleeved shirts and other clothing.
Avoiding using tanning beds.

Oral medications
Healthcare providers most commonly prescribe an oral tricyclic
antidepressant
called
amitriptyline
for brachioradial pruritus. This is because tricyclic antidepressants are known to help treat nerve issues, like
neuropathic pain
.
Other oral medications include:
Gabapentin
.
Risperidone
.
Fluoxetine
.
Chlorpromazine
.
Hydroxyzine
.
Topical medications
Topical medications (like creams and lotions) for brachioradial pruritus include:
Capsaicin
.
Mild
corticosteroids
.
Local anesthetics (amitriptyline/ketamine).
Antihistamines
.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis (outlook) for people with brachioradial pruritus?
For many people with brachioradial pruritus, symptoms go away in a few weeks to a few months after taking medication and reducing exposure to sunlight.
For some, the itching and burning sensations come and go for the rest of their lives. In many cases, healthcare providers can successfully manage these flare-ups.
Many people with the condition find that symptoms improve during the winter months.
Some people with brachioradial pruritus experience skin complications due to excessive scratching. They include:
Scratches and sores.
Prurigo nodules (hard lumps).
Lichenification (thick, leathery skin).
Hypopigmentation
or
hyperpigmentation
.
Eczema
.
Prevention
Can I prevent brachioradial pruritus?
There’s no known way to prevent brachioradial pruritus. But you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by
protecting your skin
from exposure to sunlight and UV radiation. Wear protective clothing when you go outside. Always use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30.
