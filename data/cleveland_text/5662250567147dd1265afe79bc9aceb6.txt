Antivirals
Antiviral medications help your body fight off harmful viruses. These drugs can ease symptoms and shorten the length of a viral infection. Antivirals also lower the risk of getting or spreading viruses that cause herpes and HIV. Several approved antivirals treat the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Overview
What are antivirals?
Antivirals are medications that help your body fight off certain
viruses
that can cause disease. Antiviral drugs are also preventive. This means they can protect you from getting
viral infections
or spreading a virus to others. Healthcare providers sometimes call taking antivirals antiviral therapy.

What do antivirals treat?
Most viruses clear up without antiviral medications. Healthcare providers prescribe antivirals to treat life-threatening or chronic (long-term) viral infections, including:
Coronaviruses
like
COVID-19
.
Ebola
.
Flu
, including
H1N1 (swine flu)
.
Herpes
.
Hepatitis B
and
hepatitis C
.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
.
Mpox
.
What do antiviral drugs do?
Antiviral medications help your body fight off infections. They’re like extra reinforcements that work alongside your body’s natural defenses to keep you safe from the invading virus. They do this in three different ways:
Blocking receptors so viruses can’t bind to and enter healthy cells in your body.
Boosting your
immune system
(your body’s natural defense system) to help it fight off a viral infection.
Lowering the viral load (amount of active virus) in your body.
How do you take antiviral drugs?
Most antivirals are oral drugs you swallow as pills. But you may also receive antiviral medications as:
Eye drops.
Inhaled powder.
Injections (shots) into a
muscle
.
IV (intravenous) infusions into a
vein
.
Topical ointments or creams that you rub into your
skin
.
Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of taking antivirals?
Antivirals can reduce the severity of symptoms you experience and make some infections clear up (get better) faster than they would without treatment. In some cases, antiviral medications can save your life or prevent severe complications that the infection would cause if it wasn’t treated.

Can antivirals cure viral infections?
It depends on which type of viral infection you have. Some viral infections can be cured, but others cause chronic (long-term) conditions that we can’t cure yet.
Antivirals can eliminate some viruses like the flu and Ebola. They can rid your body of these viruses.
Viral infections like HIV, hepatitis and herpes are chronic. Antivirals can’t get rid of these viruses once you have them in your body. But antiviral medicines can make chronic viruses latent (inactive) so you have few, if any, symptoms. Symptoms that develop while you take antivirals may be less severe or go away faster.
Can antivirals prevent the spread of viral infections?
Yes, antiviral drugs can keep you from getting certain viral infections after you’re exposed to them. They can also reduce the risk that you spread an infection to others.
For example, taking antivirals:
Within 48 hours (two days)
of exposure to the flu may keep you from getting sick.
Within 72 hours (three days)
of a potential HIV exposure can lower the chances you get infected.
Every day
can lower the risk of passing herpes or HIV to others or getting them from a sexual partner who has it.
During pregnancy
lowers the risk of a pregnant
woman
passing a virus they have to the fetus (babies will also receive antivirals after they’re born).
Are antivirals safe?
Yes, antivirals are safe if you take them when a healthcare provider prescribes them to you. Make sure you follow all the instructions and take your antivirals as often (and for as long) as your provider prescribes.
It’s usually safe to take an antiviral along with other medications. But tell your provider about any other prescriptions you’re taking and any over-the-counter (OTC) medications or herbal supplements you use. They’ll tell you which medications or supplements you should change, stop using or temporarily avoid while you’re taking antivirals.
What are the side effects of antiviral drugs?
Antiviral side effects can vary depending on which medication you’re taking and how strong the dose is. You may experience:
Cough
.
Dry mouth
.
Diarrhea
.
Dizziness
.
Fatigue
.
Headaches
.
Insomnia
.
Joint pain
Muscle pain
.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Skin rash
.
Don’t stop taking your antiviral medication unless your provider tells you to, even if you’re experiencing side effects. Skipping doses or starting and stopping an antiviral medicine can allow a virus to adapt to the medication so it’s no longer effective (
antiviral resistance
). People who take antivirals for a long time to manage chronic infections are more likely to have antiviral resistance.

Talk to your healthcare provider about any potential side effects from your medications. They’ll let you know what to expect and will tell you when you should stop or change your medication’s dosage.
Recovery and Outlook
How long do you need to take antiviral medications?
How long you’ll need an antiviral varies depending on which medication you need and the infection you have. For example, you might only need a week or two of some oral medications. And some antivirals delivered via IV only need a single infusion.
If you have a chronic infection like HIV, you may need to take antivirals every day for the rest of your life. Daily doses of your medication can keep the virus from becoming active and reduce the chances it can pass to others.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Your provider will tell you when you’ll need follow-up appointments or tests. They’ll monitor your body for changes and make sure the antiviral is managing the infection you have. If you have a chronic condition, you’ll need regular checkups to manage the infection and check your overall health.
Talk to your provider if you experience severe side effects or if you notice new or worsening infection symptoms. Don’t stop taking your medication unless your provider says it’s safe to.
Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between an antiviral and an antibiotic?
Antivirals and antibiotics are both medications that help your body fight infections. The difference is which type of infection they treat.

Antivirals treat and prevent viral infections. Each antiviral only works against a specific virus. Because viruses inside cells are harder to target, antiviral drugs are more challenging to develop. There are more viruses than antiviral drugs to treat them.
Antibiotics
help your immune system fight off bacterial infections. One type of antibiotic can usually treat many different kinds of
bacterial infections
. But they don’t work on viruses.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Antivirals can be lifesaving medications. You might need them temporarily while you treat and recover from a short-term infection. But you might also need to take antivirals for the rest of your life to manage a chronic condition.
No matter why you need them, never hesitate to talk to your provider if you’re worried about the infection, your medication or side effects you’re experiencing. You know your body better than anyone — if something feels worse, different or strange, let your provider know right away. They’ll help you adjust your medication and or other treatments.
