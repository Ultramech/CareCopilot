Losing weight isn’t always as simple as eating less and exercising more. These drugs can be the answer to years of health challenges for many people. But they aren’t a quick fix or a silver bullet. They come with risks and side effects. And they aren’t for everyone.
Your healthcare provider can help you understand the pros and cons of this treatment and if it’s right for you. Weight loss medicines should always be taken under your provider’s supervision.
Who should take weight loss drugs?
These drugs are for people who have health conditions stemming from obesity or overweight. These conditions could include:
Heart disease
High cholesterol
High blood pressure
Sleep apnea
Type 2 diabetes
Fatty liver disease
Joint pain
Being unable to have surgery due to weight
Healthcare providers also use
body mass index (BMI
) as a factor. They may suggest weight loss medication if:
You’re an adult with a BMI of 30 or higher
You’re an adult with a BMI higher than 27, plus a weight-related health condition
The decision to begin weight loss drugs should only happen after you and your provider discuss your health history.
Treatment Details
How do weight loss medications work?
Weight loss drugs work in different ways to help you lose weight. Most of them work in one or more of the following ways:
Decrease your appetite or reduce cravings
Help you feel full
Change how you absorb fat
Increase how many calories you burn
Improve
insulin
sensitivity
Acting on the “weight set point” in the brain and lowering it

Most weight loss medicines are prescription only. They’re broadly classified by the way they work. They can also be categorized as being a
GLP-1 agonist
or not. This is a newer class of medications that were first used to treat
Type 2 diabetes
. Healthcare providers noticed that it also led to significant weight loss. Because of this, some GLP-1s are now approved for weight loss, too.

Bupropion/naltrexone
Bupropion-naltrexone combines an antidepressant (bupropion) and an addiction treatment drug (naltrexone). It comes as a pill that you swallow. It works by changing your brain chemistry, so you aren’t hungry. It can raise blood pressure, so your provider will need to check yours regularly. Common side effects include nausea, headache and constipation. Bupropion also carries a suicide risk warning. This medication is also helpful if you have substance use disorder or if your main issue is sugar cravings.
Liraglutide
This medication slows down how quickly your stomach empties. This makes you feel fuller for longer. Liraglutide is a daily injection. Nausea is the most common side effect.
Orlistat
Orlistat works by changing how your body digests and absorbs fat. A lower-dose version of orlistat (Alli) is available over the counter. It may cause side effects like gas and diarrhea. It works best when you follow a low-fat diet. These weight loss medications come in a pill you swallow.
Phentermine/topiramate
This combination drug helps with weight loss by decreasing your appetite and helping you burn calories. Possible side effects include increased heart rate and blood pressure, insomnia and nervousness. Phentermine as a standalone weight loss medication (Adipex-P) is for short-term use only. This medication comes as a pill you swallow. Topiramate can cause kidney stones.
Semaglutide
This medication can also help with Type 2 diabetes because it helps manage blood sugar levels. It also helps you feel fuller for longer. It’s a weekly injection. Side effects could include stomach issues like diarrhea, vomiting and nausea.
Tirzepatide
This drug lowers blood sugar and reduces appetite by working with two natural hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) in your body. Tirzepatide helps you feel full longer, so you eat less. It’s a once-weekly injection. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.
Are there any over-the-counter weight loss medicines?
Alli is the only one that’s FDA‑approved and available over the counter (OTC). Other OTC weight loss medications are supplements. They aren’t as powerful or as well-studied as prescription weight loss medications. Talk to your healthcare provider before buying weight loss supplements on your own.

Recovery and Outlook
How effective are weight loss medications?
Most adults can expect to lose between 3% to 12% of their starting body weight after one year.
Their exact success varies depending on factors like:
The medication and your individual response
How long you use it
If you eat healthy and exercise while taking it
Results can vary from person to person. The weight can come back if you stop the medication. That’s why developing healthy eating and exercise habits should be part of your treatment plan, too.
How long will I take weight loss medication?
It depends on your results and side effects. If you’re doing well on the medicine, your provider may suggest you stay on it for years. But if you aren’t seeing results or having serious side effects, they may recommend you stop, switch or add medication.
How long until I see results from weight loss drugs?
This varies. Most people lose around 5% of their body weight after three to six months. If you don’t, your provider may suggest a different medication or add another medication. You should also make sure you check in with your provider regularly so they can monitor your progress.

When should I call my healthcare provider?
You should only use weight loss drugs if you plan on keeping regular checkups with your healthcare provider. They’ll need to monitor your weight loss and make sure it’s still safe for you to take the medication.
Contact your provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms:
Serious side effects like chest pain, trouble breathing or a fast heartbeat
Mood changes like depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts
Intense or severe stomach issues like vomiting constantly or being nauseous all the time
Any other new symptoms or health problems
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Losing weight can feel like an uphill battle. It’s a tough journey to take, but you’re not alone. Sometimes, eating healthy and exercising isn’t enough. You may have existing medical conditions that make it hard to lose weight, or you may have tried everything under the sun with no success. That’s where weight loss medications come in. They can decrease your appetite, make you feel full or change how your body stores and burns fat. But these medications have risks and side effects. That’s why you should only take them once you know how they can affect you. Talk to your provider so you know exactly how they work and how to use them.
