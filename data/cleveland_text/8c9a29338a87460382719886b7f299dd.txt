Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)
SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) is a common kind of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). With SVT, your heartbeat is too fast and starts in your heart’s upper chambers. You may or may not have symptoms like chest pain or dizziness. There are some things you can do on your own, but you may need medicine or surgery to help with symptoms.

Overview
Various types of SVT all have a fast heart rate and start in your heart’s upper chambers.
What is supraventricular tachycardia?
Supraventricular
tachycardia
(SVT) is a fast heart rate that starts in your upper
heart chambers
. When your heart is beating too fast at rest, it makes it hard to send enough blood to your body. Episodes can go on for seconds to hours.

When your
heart
beats too quickly, there’s not enough time for your heart chambers to fill with
blood
before they contract.
If you have symptoms, you may think something doesn’t feel right in your chest. Although it may be difficult, noting the details of what you’re experiencing can help a healthcare provider make a diagnosis.
Types of SVT
Different kinds of SVT include:
Premature atrial contractions
(PACs).
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
(PSVT).
Accessory pathway tachycardias like
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome
.
AV (atrioventricular) nodal reentrant tachycardia
(AVNRT).
Atrial tachycardia
.
Atrial fibrillation
.
Atrial flutter
.
Symptoms and Causes
What does supraventricular tachycardia feel like?
You might not have any symptoms with SVT. But whether you realize it or not, your heart’s beating more than 100 times per minute while at rest.
Other supraventricular tachycardia symptoms may include:
Having
chest pain
.
Feeling tired.
Feeling lightheaded.
Sweating.
Feeling
dizzy
.
Passing out
.
Having
palpitations
(fluttering in your chest).
Feeling short of breath (
dyspnea
).
Symptoms may range from mild to severe.
What causes SVT?
A problem with your heart’s electrical signals or circuitry causes SVT. Some people may not be aware of what brings their symptoms on. Others have a clear “trigger” that starts their SVT. Supraventricular tachycardia causes that can bring about symptoms include:
Advertisement
Stress
.
Caffeine.
Alcohol-containing beverages.
Cigarette smoke.
Physical activity.
A shortage of sleep
.
Dehydration
.
What are the risk factors?
Children and adults can get supraventricular tachycardia. Risk factors for SVT  include:
Being
female
.
Having
anxiety
.
Drinking more alcohol-containing beverages than the
suggested limit
.
Using tobacco products.
Drinking more caffeine-containing beverages than the suggested limit.
Doing hard physical training.
Having lung disease, heart issues,
thyroid disease
or
diabetes
.
Being
pregnant
.
What are the complications of supraventricular tachycardia?
A serious case of SVT may lead to:
Heart failure
.
Unconsciousness.
Cardiac arrest
.
Is it life-threatening?
SVT isn’t life-threatening in most cases, but it can be for people with other heart issues.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is supraventricular tachycardia diagnosed?
During a
physical exam
, your healthcare provider will ask about your medical history and the symptoms you’ve been having.
They’ll most likely do an
electrocardiogram
(EKG or ECG). If your provider needs to study your heart for a longer amount of time, they may ask you to wear a
heart monitor
that records the electrical activity in your heart.
Management and Treatment
How is supraventricular tachycardia treated?
You may not need SVT treatment. Some people may feel better after resting more, drinking less coffee or alcohol-containing drinks, or after quitting
smoking
. If those don’t help, you have lots of other options.
At-home treatments
Try one of these first:
Lie down.
Put an ice-cold towel on your face.
Cough.
Medications for SVT
Several medicines can slow down your heart rate:
Adenosine
.
Atropine
.
Beta-blockers
.
Calcium channel blockers
.
Digitalis (
digoxin
).
Potassium channel blockers.
If your healthcare provider prescribes medicines for you, be sure to follow the instructions for taking them. Also, keep going to your follow-up appointments.
Procedures and maneuvers
Your provider can use these methods for supraventricular tachycardia treatment:
Vagal maneuvers
like applying pressure to specific areas of your neck (carotid sinus massage).
Cardioversion
, which uses a shock to return your heart to a normal rhythm.
Catheter ablation
, which can eliminate the areas causing the abnormal electricity. In certain circumstances, your provider may consider catheter ablation before trying medications. Catheter ablation has a
cure rate that can surpass 95%
depending on the specific SVT type.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
, a device that can deliver a shock when you need it.
What are complications/side effects of  treatment?
Any medicine may have side effects. Although a catheter ablation has a low risk of major complications, it may cause:
Bleeding.
Heart attack
.
Heart block
.
Stroke
.
How soon after SVT treatment will I feel better?
Vagal maneuvers and at-home treatments can bring relief right away — if they work. Medicines and procedures are more reliable but take longer to work. If you’re having an SVT episode, it’s worth trying at-home treatments. For the long term, you may need medicines or procedures.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have SVT?
The outlook is good for most people with SVT. But if you have a structural issue with your heart, your prognosis (outlook) may not be as good. It depends on the severity of the problem.
Can you live a normal life with supraventricular tachycardia?
Yes. You can manage very infrequent episodes with medications. With successful treatments like catheter ablation, you can do many of the typical things you want to. Ablation can cure certain forms of SVT.
Prevention
How can I lower my risk of supraventricular tachycardia?
If SVT is from causes you can change, you can:
Manage your stress.
Drink fewer
alcohol-containing drinks
.
Stop using tobacco products.
Drink less coffee and other things that have
caffeine
.
Rest more.
You should also keep taking the medicine your healthcare provider prescribed for you.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s frustrating and concerning to feel like something isn’t right with your heart. But once you have an SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) diagnosis, you’re on your way to a solution.
