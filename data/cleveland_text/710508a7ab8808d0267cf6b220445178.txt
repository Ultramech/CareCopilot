Listeria
risk.

Diagnosis and Tests

placenta
.
Management and Treatment
How is
Listeria
treated in pregnancy?
Providers treat
Listeria
in pregnant women and newborns with
antibiotics
. If you might have been exposed to
Listeria
(like if you ate something that’s been
recalled
or made other people sick), your provider will recommend that you monitor yourself for symptoms. They’ll treat you if you develop symptoms.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to your pregnancy care provider if you have a fever or other symptoms during pregnancy, or if you think you’ve been exposed to
Listeria
. They can monitor your symptoms and determine if you need treatment.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I’m pregnant and have a
Listeria
infection?
If you have a
Listeria
infection and you’re pregnant, quick treatment can reduce your risk of pregnancy loss and other complications. It can also reduce your risk of passing the infection to the fetus.
Your provider may test your baby when they’re born or look for signs of
Listeria
. They can treat them as soon as possible if they’re infected.
Prevention
Can
Listeria
be prevented during pregnancy?
The best way to prevent a
Listeria
infection in pregnancy is to:
Avoid high-risk foods, like soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk and juice, and deli meat.
Follow food safety guidelines
, like washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
Cook meats to a safe temperature
before eating.
Heat lunch meat and hot dogs to steaming.
Providers also recommend these same steps to reduce your risk if you’re trying to get pregnant.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
The list of things you’re not supposed to eat or drink during pregnancy may seem endless. Avoiding foods like soft cheeses and deli meats reduces your risk of
Listeria
. But don’t panic if you eat something on the list. If you develop symptoms or find out something in your fridge is recalled, let your provider know. Quick treatment can protect the health of your pregnancy.
