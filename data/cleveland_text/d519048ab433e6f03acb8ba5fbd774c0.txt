Hyperlexia
Hyperlexia is a condition in which your child begins reading remarkedly earlier than expected for their age. While they can decode and figure out letters and words, they won’t yet know or understand what they’re reading. Hyperlexia is frequently associated with autism, but not all kids with autism have it and vice versa.

Overview
What is hyperlexia?
Hyperlexia is a
learning difference
in which your child begins reading words earlier than expected. They may have an obsessive interest in letters and numbers. In this condition, your child’s word-reading ability exceeds their language comprehension.

“Hyper-” in this instance means “better than,” and “-lexia” means “language or reading.” If your child has hyperlexia, they may be able to figure out how to sound out or decode words faster than average, but they probably won’t understand most of what they’re reading.
Hyperlexia is frequently linked with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
. But not all children who have hyperlexia are autistic. Approximately 84% of children who have hyperlexia are on the autism spectrum. But only 6% to 14% of children who have autism also have hyperlexia.
Types of hyperlexia
Researchers have identified three types of hyperlexia:
Hyperlexia I
. This type occurs when typically developing children learn to read early and far above their expected level. Some researchers state that this type of early reading shouldn’t be considered hyperlexia. Most agree that hyperlexia I doesn’t require any kind of treatment.
Hyperlexia II
. This type of hyperlexia is associated with children with autism spectrum disorder. Children take an early interest in letters and numbers, preferring books over other kinds of toys. They also display other typical
signs of autism
. Therapists often use your child’s hyperlexic skills as a tool for treatment.
Hyperlexia III
. This type is similar to hyperlexia II, but the symptoms of the condition reduce over time and disappear with age. Children have advanced reading skills but delays in their verbal language development. Children with hyperlexia III show some signs of autism but have typical social communication skills.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of hyperlexia?
The most obvious hyperlexia symptoms are advanced word-reading skills and an intense interest in letters and numbers. Your child may appear to be an exceptional reader, but they likely won’t understand what they’re reading.
Most children with hyperlexia will display the following characteristics:
Quick learning ability
. Children with hyperlexia learn to read quickly with little instruction. They sometimes teach themselves how to read, by repeating words they hear and see repeatedly.
Love for books
. Children with hyperlexia love books and other reading materials more than other types of toys. They may spell words in the air with their fingers or spell out loud.
Reduced comprehension.
Children with hyperlexia have advanced reading skills but lower-than-average learning skills. They might have trouble understanding how to play a game or put together a puzzle.
Signs of a developmental disorder
. Children with hyperlexia may display signs of a developmental disorder, like behavioral issues or being unable to communicate or speak like typically developing children of the same age.
What causes hyperlexia?
Researchers don’t know the exact cause of hyperlexia. Most believe the condition develops due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors that can affect your child’s
brain
development.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is hyperlexia diagnosed?
There’s no specific test to diagnose hyperlexia. The condition can be difficult to diagnose because it doesn’t always stand alone. Your child may have other learning or behavioral issues. And there’s not a clear definition for it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (
DSM-5
). Hyperlexia is listed as a part of autism in the DSM-5.
If you think your child may have hyperlexia, reach out to their
pediatrician
. They may refer you to a specialist like a
child psychologist
or
speech-language pathologist
to diagnose the disorder. Your child’s provider may give them special tests to determine their level of language understanding. The tests aren’t hard — they’re just meant to find out how much your child knows and understands.
Your child’s provider will also perform vision, hearing and reflex tests to evaluate their communication skills. In addition, since hyperlexia is so closely linked with autism, your child’s provider will likely recommend
autism-specific evaluation tools
to confirm or rule out the condition.
Management and Treatment
How do you help a child with hyperlexia?
Treatment for hyperlexia depends on the type and your child’s unique condition. Children with hyperlexia type I typically don’t require any treatment. Children with hyperlexia type II and hyperlexia type III may benefit from various types of therapy, including:

Speech therapy
. This type of therapy can help improve your child’s language and social skills. A speech-language pathologist will use your child’s advanced reading abilities to help them develop and improve their weaknesses. Your child’s treatment plan will be tailored specifically to their needs. This may include social skills, understanding spoken language, or writing and speaking.
Occupational therapy
. This is a specialized type of therapy that focuses on the unique needs of your child. Your child’s therapist may work on many different areas of difficulty. This may include the areas of sleeping, feeding, self-care, writing and participating in school and social activities.
Psychological therapy
. In this type of therapy, a child psychologist will work with your child on their specific needs, including emotional, behavioral and learning issues.
In addition, correct educational placement is important in the treatment of hyperlexia. If your child has hyperlexia II, they may benefit from being in a special education classroom. Classrooms with typically developing children may be too stimulating for them. Your child may learn better in a one-on-one environment. But if your child has hyperlexia III, they may benefit from being part of a typical classroom setting. This will give them more chances to work on their
social skills
while developing other learning skills.

Prevention
Can hyperlexia be prevented?
Researchers don’t know the exact cause of hyperlexia. Because of this, there’s no way to prevent the condition.
Living With
When should my child see their healthcare provider?
If your child is exhibiting signs of hyperlexia, it might be worth a trip to their pediatrician’s office. While some kids who read early have hyperlexia, others are just gifted. Your child’s healthcare provider can help determine if your child needs further evaluation and/or treatment.
What questions should I ask my child’s healthcare provider?
Questions you may want to ask your child’s healthcare provider include:
What type of hyperlexia does my child have?
Does this mean my child could have autism, too?
What treatment methods or therapies do you recommend?
Will my child grow out of hyperlexia?
What can I do to help my child thrive with this condition?
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between hyperlexia and dyslexia?
Dyslexia
is the opposite of hyperlexia. While children with hyperlexia learn to read early, those with dyslexia have trouble with spelling and reading. But unlike children with hyperlexia, children with dyslexia usually understand what they’re reading. They can communicate and reason very well.
Dyslexia is a much more common learning disability than hyperlexia. Up to 20% of people in the U.S. have dyslexia, which accounts for 80% to 90% percent of all learning disabilities.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If your young child is reading at an exceptional rate, they don’t necessarily have hyperlexia, and it doesn’t mean they have autism. Some kids just learn to read early. But you know your child best. If you see any signs that stand out to you, make an appointment with your child’s healthcare provider. They can help you determine the next step forward. Like all learning disabilities, the sooner you have your child evaluated, the better. Prompt treatment will help maximize your child’s potential.
