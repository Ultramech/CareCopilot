Brain damage, often from a stroke or traumatic brain injury, causes this language disorder. Your symptoms may improve over time, but your outlook varies.
While global aphasia affects your language, it doesn’t affect your intelligence.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of global aphasia?
The symptoms of global aphasia include:
Little to no understanding of spoken words.
Significant difficulty communicating through reading and writing.
Little to no ability to express yourself.
Your symptoms may make you feel isolated and
depressed
since you have trouble communicating and understanding others.
Can people with this condition read or write?
No. You won’t be able to read or write with global aphasia.
What causes global aphasia?
Extensive damage to different language processing centers of your
brain
, specifically Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area, causes global aphasia. These parts of your brain help you understand language, access vocabulary and grammar, and form words and sentences.
Brain damage can happen after:
A
stroke
Traumatic brain injury
(TBI).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is global aphasia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose global aphasia after a
physical exam
,
neurological exam
and testing. During the exams, your provider will ask you or your caregiver questions about your symptoms and health history. During the exam, you may choose to have someone you trust with you to help, since it’ll be difficult to speak or understand the questions your provider asks.

Your provider may order imaging tests, like an
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) or
CT scan
(computed tomography scan), to look for brain damage.
You may need to see a
speech-language pathologist
(SLP) to confirm a diagnosis. A speech-language pathologist will test your language skills to determine the severity of your language processing issues. This evaluation also helps determine what treatment options to try.
Management and Treatment
How is global aphasia treated?
Your healthcare provider will recommend
speech therapy
to treat global aphasia. During speech therapy, you’ll work closely with a speech-language pathologist. They’ll help you:
Regain lost language and communication skills.
Learn alternative ways to communicate.
Educate your loved ones and caregivers on how to communicate with you effectively.
Your provider may recommend the following techniques:
Augmentative and alternative communication:
There are a variety of ways to communicate without using speech. A healthcare provider will teach you different ways to express your wants and needs. For example, you may use a board with pictures on it and point to the image of a tree if you want to go outside.
Visual action therapy:
This is a type of nonverbal therapy (you don’t need to use words to participate). Your provider will teach you gestures (physical movements) to represent objects. Your movements help you communicate. For example, you may curve your fingers around an imaginary glass and move your hand to your mouth to say that you’d like something to drink.
Music therapy
(melodic intonation therapy):
A provider will use rhythms and melodies to stimulate language processing areas of your brain. This may improve your speech and how you understand language.
In addition, clinical trials (tests on humans) are in progress to learn about new treatment methods and their effectiveness for global aphasia. You may qualify to try medications or types of brain stimulation like
transcranial magnetic stimulation
during clinical trials.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can you fully recover from global aphasia?
Your recovery depends on many factors, like the extent of brain damage, for example. Your healthcare provider can give you the best advice for your situation.
Symptoms are usually the most severe immediately after a stroke or brain injury. You may notice symptoms get better in the weeks to months following the event.
Some people make a full recovery, but others may have lingering symptoms throughout their lives. The most severe cases require lifelong management.
Prevention
Can it be prevented?
You can’t prevent all causes of global aphasia, but you can reduce your risk by:
Managing any underlying medical conditions.
Taking safety precautions when participating in high-risk activities.
Contacting emergency services at the first sign of a stroke to minimize brain damage.

When should I see a healthcare provider?
Visit a healthcare provider if you or a loved one experiences language difficulties that affect your ability to speak, understand what others say, read and/or write. These often happen suddenly after an accident or stroke. A healthcare provider can determine what treatment options will work best for your situation.

What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
If you’re caring for a loved one with global aphasia, one of the best ways you can help is to ask the important questions, like:
Will my loved one make a full recovery?
How often should they participate in speech therapy?
How do I communicate with my loved one who has global aphasia?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s difficult to imagine what it would feel like to experience global aphasia as you’re reading this right now. Activities like singing the lyrics to your favorite song or reading the headline of a newspaper are suddenly not possible after an event like a stroke. It can be a lonely experience not to understand or feel understood. But you don’t have to face it alone. Healthcare providers will work closely with you and your loved ones on a treatment plan specific to your needs. They’ll help you learn new ways to express yourself that make communication easier and more effective.
