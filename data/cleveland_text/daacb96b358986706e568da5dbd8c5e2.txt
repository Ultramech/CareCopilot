Liver inflammation can also occur if you take too much of certain medications or drink too much alcohol. Over time, inflammation causes permanent liver damage.
What does your liver do?

Are there different types of toxic hepatitis?
Types of toxic hepatitis include:
Acute toxic hepatitis:
This type develops suddenly. Symptoms occur immediately or shortly after exposure to a toxic substance.
Chronic toxic hepatitis:
This type may take longer to develop. You may not have any hepatitis symptoms for weeks or months.
Healthcare providers also categorize types of hepatitis according to the cause:
Chemical-induced hepatitis:
You develop this because of exposure to chemicals through ingesting, breathing or touching the chemical.
Drug-induced hepatitis:
You develop this type because of taking too much of certain medications, such as acetaminophen,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
and other drugs.
Alcohol-induced hepatitis:
This type is due to alcohol use disorder, especially if you also use recreational drugs.

What causes toxic hepatitis?
Exposure to certain chemicals or medications can cause toxic hepatitis symptoms to develop. Symptoms may develop soon after exposure, or they may develop over weeks or months.
But exposure to these substances doesn’t mean you’ll always develop toxic hepatitis. Every person reacts differently.
Some causes of toxic hepatitis include:

Herbal supplements

Drinking too much alcohol can cause
alcohol-induced hepatitis
. If you experience
alcohol use disorder
, it’s important to talk to a healthcare provider.
Acetaminophen liver toxicity
You may develop liver toxicity if you take too much
acetaminophen
(Tylenol®), an over-the-counter pain reliever. Many people use acetaminophen to treat fever and pain. Most adults shouldn’t take:
More than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen in one day (24 hours).
Acetaminophen for more than 10 days in a row.
Too much acetaminophen can be dangerous if you already have liver disease. Call your healthcare provider right away if you take more than the recommended dose. Your provider may order an
acetaminophen level test
.
Vitamin A liver toxicity
Taking too much
vitamin A
(more than 40,000 IU daily) can cause vitamin A liver toxicity. Talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements or over-the-counter medications you take.

liver disease
, including
