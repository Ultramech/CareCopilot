Is Pitt-Hopkins syndrome a form of autism?
PTHS isn’t autism. But children with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome have many of the same characteristics as people with
autism spectrum disorder
.
Who does Pitt-Hopkins syndrome affect?
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome can affect anyone. Symptoms typically begin in childhood.
How common is Pitt-Hopkins syndrome?
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is a rare
genetic disorder
. Researchers know of about 500 people in the world who have this condition.
How does Pitt-Hopkins syndrome affect my child?
Besides physical symptoms, children with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome typically have:
Developmental delays
.
Inability to speak or limited language development.
Intellectual impairments.
Limited social skills.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome?
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome causes changes to a
child’s development
. They may experience delays in learning to walk and have difficulties with speech and communication skills.
Children with PTHS usually have differences in the shape of their facial features. They may also experience:
Constipation
.
Epilepsy
.
Hypotonia
.
Microcephaly
.
Myopia (nearsightedness)
.
Strabismus (crossed eyes)
.
Trouble with breathing and
respiratory system
problems.
What causes Pitt-Hopkins syndrome?
A change (mutation) to the
TCF4
gene causes PTHS.
TCF4
controls proteins that affect how your
brain
and
nervous system
develop.
A child has a 50% chance of inheriting this genetic change if one parent also has the mutation (known as an
autosomal dominant
pattern). But a mutation to
TCF4
can happen even if neither parent has the mutation (known as a de novo occurrence).

Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose Pitt-Hopkins syndrome?
You or your healthcare provider may notice differences in your
newborn’s appearance
. Your provider may see PTHS symptoms during a
well-baby visit
or
well-child visit
as your child grows. They may recommend tests to confirm PTHS.
What tests do healthcare providers use to diagnose Pitt-Hopkins syndrome?
Your healthcare provider may recommend genetic testing for your child. Providers may draw a sample of your child’s blood or swab the inside of their cheek to take a DNA sample. A genetic specialist examines this sample to learn if there is a
TCF4
mutation.
If your child experiences seizures, your provider may recommend:
Electroencephalogram (EEG)
.
MRI
of their brain.
Management and Treatment
How do healthcare providers treat Pitt-Hopkins syndrome?
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome isn’t curable. But healthcare providers can treat the symptoms of PTHS. Talk with your provider about whether your child may benefit from the care of a:
Gastroenterologist (
digestive system
specialist).
Neurologist
.
Ophthalmologist
.
Pulmonologist
.
Your child’s care team can put together a treatment plan that targets your child’s symptoms, including constipation, vision trouble and breathing problems. Your child may need frequent follow-up appointments so providers can modify the treatments as your child’s symptoms change.
