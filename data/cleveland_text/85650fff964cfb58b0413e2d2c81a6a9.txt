Malocclusion
Malocclusion (or a “bad bite”) means your upper and lower teeth don’t align when you close your mouth. Left untreated, it can cause tooth erosion, gum disease and other oral health issues. Providers usually treat dental malocclusion with braces or other orthodontics. Severe cases might require oral surgery.

Overview
Not all malocclusions are the same. There are different types and classes depending on how your teeth and jaws relate.
What is malocclusion?
Malocclusion means having a misaligned bite. When you have malocclusion, your upper and lower
teeth
don’t fit together properly when you close your
mouth
. It might happen because you have crowded or crooked teeth. Or it could happen because your upper and lower jaws don’t align the way they should.

Most cases of malocclusion are hereditary. That means you’re more likely to have misaligned teeth if your biological parents, grandparents or siblings also have misaligned teeth. But other factors, like tooth loss or
dental trauma
, can cause it too.
Untreated malocclusion can be harmful. It causes several health concerns that can worsen with age, like
tooth decay
and
gum disease
. It may also affect how you chew or speak. Malocclusion can also impact your mental health.
Research
shows that some people may avoid social situations and relationships because they feel self-conscious about their oral health and appearance.
Types of malocclusion
You might hear healthcare providers use these terms when describing different types of malocclusion:
Crossbite
: Your upper teeth fit inside your lower teeth when you close your mouth.
Open bite
: Your upper and lower front teeth don’t touch when you close your mouth.
Overbite
: A deep vertical bite. It happens when your upper teeth overlap your lower teeth more than they should.
Overjet
: Your upper front teeth stick out further than they should. Some people call this “buck teeth.”
Underbite
: Your lower front teeth extend beyond your upper front teeth.
How common is malocclusion?
Malocclusion is a common dental issue affecting around
56% of people worldwide
. While up to
93% of children and adolescents
have some degree of malocclusion, not all these cases require treatment. But if malocclusion interferes with your oral health or function, you should ask your dentist about orthodontic treatment.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of malocclusion?
Malocclusion symptoms may include:
Cheek biting.
Difficulty biting or chewing.
Lisping or other
speech issues
.
Misaligned teeth.
Mouth breathing
.
What causes malocclusion?
Sometimes, malocclusion happens if your teeth are too large (or too crowded) for your mouth. But it can also happen if your upper and lower jaws don’t align. Many things can cause this, including:
Genetics
.
Ill-fitting
crowns
, bridges or other dental restorations.
Impacted teeth
.
Prolonged thumb sucking or pacifier use during childhood.
Teeth grinding (bruxism)
.
Tooth loss.
TMJ disorders
.
Tumors
affecting your jaw or mouth.
What are the complications of malocclusion?
Untreated malocclusion can lead to conditions like:
Gum recession
.
Injury to your
gums
.
Jaw pain
.
Malnutrition
(due to chewing issues).
Sleep apnea
or other
sleep disorders
.
Tooth erosion
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is malocclusion diagnosed?
Dentists
can diagnose malocclusion during regular dental checkups. They might take:
Dental impressions
to create study models of your mouth.
Dental X-rays
to look for decay or check the bone levels around your teeth.
Photographs of your teeth
to examine the way they fit together.
If you have malocclusion, your dentist might refer you to an
orthodontist
(a specialist who focuses on aligning your bite). Some general dentists offer braces, but severe cases of malocclusion require a specialist.
Classification systems
Healthcare providers use classification systems to diagnose malocclusions. One example is the
Ackerman and Profitt
classification system. It describes malocclusion types based on your jaw position and/or how your upper and lower teeth relate to each other:
Malocclusion classes
Description
Class I malocclusion
Your upper teeth stick out slightly beyond your lower teeth. Your jaw aligns properly.
Class II malocclusion
Your upper teeth stick out significantly beyond your lower teeth. You have an underdeveloped jaw.
Class III malocclusion
Your lower teeth stick out significantly beyond your upper teeth. You have an overdeveloped jaw. Class III malocclusion is often the most difficult type to fix.
Class IV malocclusion
Your upper teeth sit significantly behind your lower teeth.
Class V malocclusion
Your upper teeth sit significantly forward of your lower teeth. You have an overdeveloped jaw.
Class VI malocclusion
Your lower teeth sit significantly behind your upper teeth.

Management and Treatment
How is malocclusion treated?
Treatment for malocclusion may include:
Braces
to gently bring your teeth into alignment.
Clear braces
(aligners) to gradually move your teeth into their proper positions.
Jaw surgery
to correct issues you inherited or fix
jaw fractures
that didn’t heal properly.
Orthodontic headgear
to encourage jaw movement.
Restorative dentistry
to repair missing or damaged teeth.
Tooth extractions
to ease overcrowding and make more room in your jaw.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have dental malocclusion?
Treating malocclusion takes time. It doesn’t happen overnight. The length of treatment varies depending on the:
Amount of room available in your mouth.
Overall health of your teeth, gums and jawbone.
Severity of dental malocclusion.
On average, it takes about two years to complete malocclusion treatment. For some people, it takes longer. Others may only need braces for a few months.
Prevention
Can malocclusion be prevented?
Many malocclusions are hereditary, so you can’t prevent them. But environmental factors (like missing teeth) can also contribute to dental malocclusion. Here are some things you can do to reduce your risk:

Practice good
oral hygiene
.
Replace any missing teeth with
dental implants
or
dental bridges
.
Visit your dentist for regular
cleanings
and exams.
To reduce your child’s risk of malocclusion, discourage them from thumb-sucking or using a pacifier past age 4. These things can lead to dental issues over time.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should tell your dentist if you have any concerns about your teeth, especially if you have difficulty biting or chewing.
If you already wear an orthodontic appliance, let your provider know if it breaks or becomes damaged. They’ll need to fix it as soon as possible. Broken orthodontic appliances can slow your treatment.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you have misaligned teeth, here are some questions you might want to ask your dentist:
What type of malocclusion do I have?
What are my treatment options?
Will I need oral surgery? If so, will I need it before, during or after orthodontic treatment?
How long will my treatment take?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Malocclusion makes some people less confident. Maybe you don’t smile for photos anymore. Or maybe you cover your mouth when you laugh. These are all very real ways that malocclusion can affect your life. Just as important, malocclusion hinders function — the way you speak and eat. It has a negative impact on your oral health, and it can lead to more dental issues in the future. Your dentist can check your bite and tell you whether you might benefit from orthodontic treatment.
