Pinguecula
Pinguecula is a harmless, yellowish, raised growth on your eyeball. It’s thought to be caused by exposure to sun, wind and dust. Besides the bump, most people don’t have any symptoms with a pinguecula. But some people say it irritates their eyes. Your eye care provider can offer medications if you have symptoms. They can remove it if it bothers you.

Overview
A pinguecula is a harmless, yellowish growth on the clear membrane (conjunctiva) of the white of your eye.
What is a pinguecula?
A pinguecula (ping-GWEH-kyuh-luh) is a yellowish-white bump on your eye’s
conjunctiva
. Your conjunctiva is the clear membrane that covers the
white part
of your
eye
. A pinguecula typically forms on the inner side of your eyeball, close to your nose. But it sometimes, appears on the other side, too.

Pingueculae are common and harmless growths. They form after long-time exposure to the elements, especially sunlight. They contain protein, fat or calcium deposits. Pingueculae (plural) don’t go away and may grow a little over time. They usually don’t cause problems, but some people say they irritate their eyes.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a pinguecula?
A pinguecula looks like a bump or a pimple on your eyeball. It’s a small, raised, round, fleshy growth. It’s usually yellow or white. It might start as a colored spot on your eye that later forms into a lump. Most people don’t feel it, but it can increase eye dryness by disrupting the flow of tears across your eye.
What is pingueculitis?
Pingueculitis is an inflamed or irritated pinguecula. It can cause additional symptoms, like:
Eye irritation
Red eye
Eye watering
Scientists think pingueculitis is related to the same environmental irritants that cause the growth.
What causes a pinguecula?
A pinguecula is a reaction to environmental damage to your conjunctiva. It usually develops over a long period of time, which is why it’s more common with older age. People who spend more time in the elements, especially sunlight, wind, dust and sand, are more likely to develop one — often, in both eyes.
What triggers a pinguecula to grow or worsen?
Your pinguecula may grow more aggressively or may be more prone to irritation (pingueculitis) if you continue to expose your eye to the same damaging elements that caused it. Other risk factors include:

Dry eye disease
Wearing
contact lenses
Frequent irritation from other causes, like
allergies
What happens if my pinguecula keeps growing?
In rare cases, a pinguecula can keep growing until it turns into a different growth called a
pterygium
. A pterygium is essentially a more aggressive pinguecula. It’s more raised and wedge-shaped, has visible blood vessels in it and grows faster. Sometimes, it can grow across your
cornea
, affecting your vision.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a pinguecula diagnosed?
Your
eye care provider
can diagnose a pinguecula with a normal
eye exam
. Your provider will use a
slit lamp
to closely examine the growth. A slit lamp is a microscope that focuses a narrow “slit” of bright light onto your eye. It can help them distinguish between a pinguecula and similar-looking growths.
Management and Treatment
How do healthcare providers treat a pinguecula?
Most pingueculae won’t need any treatment. If your pinguecula irritates your eye or feels like a foreign body in your eye, your provider may recommend
artificial tear drops
to treat it. If that doesn’t help enough, they may prescribe medical
eye drops
, such as
steroid eye drops
to treat the inflammation.
When do they remove a pinguecula?
Most pingueculae don’t need to be removed. But your pinguecula won’t go away on its own.
Eye surgery
is the only way to remove it.
Ophthalmologists
can — but don’t often — remove a pinguecula for cosmetic reasons alone. They might suggest removing it under more unusual circumstances, like if it:
Gets irritated or inflamed a lot
Grows too close to your
cornea
and affects your
vision
Makes it difficult to wear your contact lenses

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a pinguecula?
You’ll probably have your pinguecula for the rest of your life. But it probably won’t cause you any problems. If your eye gets irritated, eye drops can treat it. Most pingueculae grow very slowly, if at all. Sometimes, in more severe cases, they grow more. If it becomes an issue, you can have it removed.
Prevention
What can I do to prevent a pinguecula?
You can lower your risk of developing a pinguecula if you:
Wear
sunglasses
when you’re in the sun to protect your eyes from ultraviolet light (wear protective eyewear if you work in overly dusty, gritty or dry conditions)
Use artificial tears to help keep your eyes moist and reduce irritation.
Living With
When should I see an eye care provider about my pinguecula?
Visit an eye care provider if you have a new growth on your eye and you’re not sure what it is. Also, let them know if your pinguecula causes symptoms or interferes with your vision, or if it seems to be growing and changing. Your provider can check it for changes and recommend appropriate treatments.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A bump on your eye can be strange and unsettling to find, but a pinguecula is a harmless growth. It’s a sign of wear and tear on your eye, but it’s damage already done. Pingueculae are very common: most people have at least one by the age of 70. If it really bothers you, your provider can remove it.
