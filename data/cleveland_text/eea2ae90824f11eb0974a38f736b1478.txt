Monocytosis
Monocytosis is when your monocyte count is too high. Monocytosis is often linked to infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. It’s also linked to blood disorders and certain cancers. But being diagnosed with monocytosis doesn’t mean you have a serious medical condition. It’s simply an indication of a potential issue.

Overview
What is monocytosis?
Monocytosis is when your monocyte count is too high.
Monocytes
are a type of
white blood cell
that protect your body from toxic substances or invaders, like
germs
. A high monocyte count is often a sign of an infection that your body is trying to get rid of. But causes include everything from chronic conditions to temporary stress from a strenuous workout.

The important thing to remember is that a high monocyte count doesn’t necessarily mean you have a serious medical condition. If you have monocytosis, your healthcare provider will take a close look at your overall health so they can identify and treat any underlying cause.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of monocytosis?
Monocytosis doesn’t cause symptoms. Instead, you may have symptoms of the medical condition that caused your high monocyte count. General symptoms of conditions that may cause monocytosis include:
Fatigue
Swelling (
inflammation
)
Muscle aches or weakness
Fever
What causes monocytosis?
Monocytosis is most often linked to a chronic infection or disease that your body is fighting. Causes may or may not be serious. Conditions associated with monocytosis include:
Mononucleosis
Autoimmune diseases
(like
rheumatoid arthritis
,
inflammatory bowel disease
and
lupus
)
Cancer
(including certain forms of
leukemia
and
lymphoma
)
Blood disorders
Short-term infections
Pregnancy
Stress
Identifying monocytosis is often the first step toward diagnosing the condition that’s causing it.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is monocytosis diagnosed?
Healthcare providers use
blood tests
to count your monocytes. This is the only way to diagnose monocytosis. In adults, a high monocyte count is 1,000 monocytes per microliter of blood, with monocytes accounting for more than 10% of your white blood cells.

Tests include:
Complete blood count
(CBC) with differential
. This test counts the number of blood cells in a sample. It’s the first step toward diagnosing monocytosis and learning what’s causing it.
Absolute monocyte count
. This test shows the number of monocytes in your blood sample. Results show whether your monocyte count is normal, too high or too low.
Peripheral blood smear
. This test helps your provider narrow down the list of potential issues causing monocytosis. They examine a sample of your blood under a microscope to assess your cells’ size and shape.
Your provider may also check your
spleen
,
liver
and
lymph nodes
to see if they are larger than normal. Depending on these findings, your provider may recommend other tests to help them identify what’s causing your monocytosis.
Management and Treatment
How is this condition treated?
Healthcare providers treat the underlying condition that causes you to have a high monocyte count. There is a range of treatments for monocytosis, depending on the cause. They include:
Antibiotics
to treat bacterial infections
Prescription medications
to reduce inflammation, like
corticosteroids
or
immunosuppressants
Cancer treatments
, like
chemotherapy
or a
stem cell transplant
Lifestyle changes
to improve your nutrition and combat stress

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
A high monocyte count is a sign of several medical conditions that require different treatments. Once you and your provider know the underlying cause, you’ll have a better idea of how your condition may affect your daily life.
Prevention
Can monocytosis be prevented?
Monocytosis is a sign of an underlying infection or other condition. Not all causes are preventable. Given that, the best way to reduce your risk of monocytosis is to avoid infections, manage any current medical conditions and boost your
immune system
. Here are some other suggestions:
Limit foods that cause inflammation
. It may be a good idea to start an
anti-inflammatory diet
.
Try to get regular exercise
. Experts recommend a
weekly workout schedule
that includes five days of cardio and two days of strength training. Ask your provider about what activity level is ideal for you.
Try to stay well-rested
. This includes taking breaks during the day if you’re living with a chronic infection or disease and
getting enough sleep
at night.
Reduce stress
.
Stress reduction
includes eating the right foods, exercising and getting enough rest. You can also incorporate relaxing activities that you enjoy into your routine.
Drink alcohol only in moderation and don’t smoke
. If you do smoke,
try to quit

wash your hands

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Lots of medical conditions can cause high monocyte counts. If you’re receiving treatment for one of these medical conditions, you’ll probably have regular appointments so your provider can diagnose and treat the underlying condition.
If you see anything on test results that concerns you, ask your provider to explain what it means.
When should I go to the emergency room?
If you have a medical condition linked to monocytosis, you should go to the emergency room if your symptoms get worse, you have new symptoms or your reaction to treatment is more than you expected.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Being diagnosed with monocytosis may be the first time you realize you may have a medical condition. Or you may already be dealing with the condition. Either way, you may have questions for your healthcare provider. Here are a few questions to consider:
Why do I have monocytosis?
Does this mean I have a serious medical condition?
How will you find out what’s causing my monocytosis?
How soon will I know what’s going on with my body?
I know I have a medical condition that causes my high monocyte count. Does a high count mean my condition is getting worse?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Monocytosis may be a sign you have a medical condition, like an autoimmune disease, a blood disorder or even cancer. Or it may mean something less serious, like you’ve been under stress or are recovering from an infection. You won’t know what it means until a healthcare provider can identify the underlying cause. Try to remember that there’s a big difference between signs, symptoms and a final diagnosis. Ask your healthcare provider to explain what to expect if your monocyte count is high.
