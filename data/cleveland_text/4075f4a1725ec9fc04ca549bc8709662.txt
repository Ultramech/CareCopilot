Double vision is usually a temporary issue, but it can also be a sign of more serious health conditions. It can be scary when something affects your
vision
. Diplopia can decrease your
depth perception
, making driving or walking more difficult and potentially unsafe.
Visit a healthcare provider or
eye care specialist
right away if you start seeing double.
Types of diplopia
An eye care specialist will classify your double vision as either monocular or binocular.
Monocular diplopia
happens when you have double vision even when you close or cover one of your eyes. It may look like there are shadows in your vision. Monocular diplopia is the most common (and usually least serious) type.
Binocular diplopia
is having double vision when both of your eyes are open. It goes away if you cover or close one eye. Your eyes being out of alignment or health conditions that affect your vision are common causes. Binocular diplopia is usually more serious.
Vertical and horizontal diplopia
Your eye care specialist might also classify diplopia as vertical or horizontal depending on where the doubled images appear in your vision.
Vertical diplopia
means you’re seeing extra images above or below your true vision.
Horizontal diplopia
is seeing doubled images side to side.

How common is diplopia?
Diplopia is very common. Experts estimate that more than 800,000 people a year in the U.S. visit an eye care specialist because they’re having some form of double vision.
It’s also one of the most common reasons people go to the emergency room. Around 50,000 people every year go to the ER because they have double vision.
Symptoms and Causes
What are diplopia symptoms?
Other than seeing double, you might experience other symptoms if you have diplopia. You might have:
Headache
.
Nausea
(upset stomach or feeling sick).
Dizziness
.
Eye pain
(including when you move your eyes).
What causes double vision?
Lots of eye problems can cause double vision. Anything that affects your brain, your eyes or the
nerves
and
muscles
that control them can lead to diplopia.
Some examples include:
Astigmatism
.
Nearsightedness (myopia)
.
Farsightedness (hyperopia)
.
Poorly-fitting
glasses
or
contacts
.
Cataracts
.
Dry eye syndrome
.
Migraines
.
Abnormalities in your
iris
(the colored part of your eye).
Cranial nerve
issues.
Proptosis
(bulging eyes).
Keratoconus
.
Head injuries.
Diplopia risk factors
Anyone can experience double vision, but it’s most common in adults older than 60.
Having certain neurological or other health conditions can increase your risk, including:
Myasthenia gravis
.
Vertigo
.
Brain aneurysms
.
Strokes
.
Diabetes
(including
diabetes-related retinopathy
).
Vitamin B1 deficiency
.
Thyroid disease
.
Multiple sclerosis (MS)
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do providers diagnose diplopia?
An eye care specialist will diagnose double vision and what’s causing it. They’ll give you an
eye exam
and check your vision with a
visual acuity test
.
If you have monocular diplopia, you likely won’t need additional tests. If you have binocular diplopia, you might need:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
.
Computed tomography (CT) scan
.
Blood tests
.
These tests will help your eye care specialist see all the parts of your eyes and the area around them to identify issues with your
bones
, muscles,
brain
or spine that might cause double vision.
Management and Treatment
How do you fix double vision?
Which treatments you’ll need depends on what’s causing diplopia. Your eye care specialist or healthcare provider will treat the cause.
Some people only need new (or adjusted) glasses or contacts. You might have to cover one eye for a while or wear a special contact lens to help your eyes regain their usual sight.
Your eye care specialist will walk you through how to manage your symptoms, including getting rid of the diplopia.
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
It depends on what’s causing the diplopia. Some cases of double vision go away on their own, others won’t get better until your eye care specialist treats the cause.
If you need surgery to correct the issues in your eye (like
removing cataracts
), you might need a few weeks to feel better.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have diplopia?
Double vision is usually a short-term issue. You shouldn’t drive or do anything else that could hurt yourself or others while your vision is impaired. Depending on what’s causing the diplopia, you might need to make some adjustments to your daily routine.
When should I worry about double vision?
Double vision is always concerning, but you shouldn’t assume the worst. Most cases are temporary. In fact, the diplopia might go away on its own. But you should still get your eyes checked if you experience double vision.
If you have double vision more than once, or if it comes and goes, you could have transient (intermittent) diplopia. Even if your double vision clears up on its own, you should see an eye care specialist or healthcare provider.
Prevention
How can I prevent diplopia?
There isn’t anything you can do specifically to prevent double vision, but taking good care of your eyes and seeing an eye care specialist regularly are the best ways to catch issues as soon as possible. Follow these steps to maintain good eye health:
Don’t
smoke
.
Give your eyes a break from looking at electronic screens throughout the day.
Wear appropriate protective glasses or goggles for all your work, sports or hobbies.
Schedule an eye exam every one to two years (or as often as your eye care specialist recommends).

How do I take care of myself?
Tell your eye care specialist about any changes in your eyes or vision. If you wear glasses or contacts, have your eyes examined regularly so your provider can adjust your prescription as often as necessary.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Visit your eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your vision. Whether it’s something as simple as needing new glasses or a more serious condition, don’t wait for symptoms to get worse before having your eyes checked.
When should I go to the emergency room?
Go to the emergency room if you’re experiencing double vision that doesn’t go away in a few hours, or if you have any of the following symptoms:
Eye pain.
Dizziness.
Muscle weakness.
Slurred speech.
Confusion.
Diplopia can be the first sign of serious brain issues like strokes, and you shouldn’t ignore it.
Which questions should I ask my provider?
Questions you may want to ask your provider include:
What’s causing the double vision?
How long will it last?
Which treatments will I need?
How often should I have my eyes and vision checked?
Additional Common Questions
Why am I seeing double all of a sudden?
You’ll usually be able to notice diplopia suddenly, even if the issue that’s causing it develops over time. Double vision can be a red flag of serious health conditions, but it’s usually a temporary issue.
Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice your vision changing, especially if it’s suddenly worse than usual. Go to the emergency room if you experience a trauma like a car accident or fall and have worse or double vision.
