Interventional Cardiology
Interventional cardiology is a specialty that diagnoses and treats heart and blood vessel conditions using small tubes called catheters. Working with these small tubes allows providers to avoid doing open-heart surgery. They can achieve results that can be lifesaving, like when treating a heart attack.

Overview
What is interventional cardiology?
Interventional cardiology uses catheters to diagnose and treat various
cardiovascular diseases
. Catheters are tiny tubes that healthcare providers put through your
blood vessels
. You don’t need an incision (cut) for these procedures.

Policy
In medicine, an intervention is a treatment or procedure that prevents or treats disease. For this field of medicine, the interventions involve using catheters.
Interventional cardiology procedures have benefits compared to more invasive cardiac surgeries, like:
Smaller cuts
Lower risk of blood loss
Faster recovery time
Shorter hospital stays
What does an interventional cardiologist do?
In interventional cardiology, the focus is on making sure your blood flows the way it should. Providers in this specialty find and fix issues that get in the way of your blood flow. For example, they may check the blood flow and pressure in your
coronary arteries
and
heart chambers
.
An interventional cardiologist uses catheters to do
minimally invasive
procedures on your heart or blood vessels. They can diagnose or treat conditions this way. They don’t do open-heart surgery like a
cardiothoracic surgeon
does.
The most common interventional cardiology procedure is
angioplasty
and
stent
placement in your coronary artery. Your provider uses a catheter to find a blockage in one of your heart’s arteries. Then, they make a path for your blood using a tiny balloon. They can keep that pathway open with a stent if needed. This can be a lifesaving procedure for a
heart attack
.

Examples of other medical procedures include:
Angiogram
Atherectomy
Atrial septal defect closure
Cardiac catheterization
Fractional flow reserve
(FFR) measurement
Heart valve replacement
and repair
Renal denervation (damaging renal artery nerves to lower blood pressure)
Thrombolysis
Why would I be referred to an interventional cardiologist?
Your healthcare provider may refer you to an interventional cardiologist if you have a heart or blood vessel issue. You may need a diagnosis or a treatment.
Some examples of these conditions include:
Aneurysms
Atherosclerosis
Blood clots
Cardiomyopathy
Carotid
and
coronary artery disease
Congenital heart conditions
Heart valve disease
Peripheral artery disease
Septal defects
Sometimes, surgery is necessary for these conditions. But an interventional cardiologist can see if you’re a good fit for a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter.
An interventional cardiologist may also give you treatment in an emergency, like if you have a heart attack.
What can I expect at an interventional cardiology appointment?
An interventional cardiologist will ask you about your symptoms and how long you’ve been having them. They’ll ask about your health history and your family’s history of heart and blood vessel issues. Be sure to bring a medication list so they can see what you’re taking. This includes medicines or supplements you buy without a prescription.
Your provider will listen to your heart. They may do simple exams at your appointment. For example, they may listen to your heart and check your blood pressure.
If you need a procedure, you’ll need to schedule a separate appointment for another day. Your provider will discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure they think would benefit you. They’ll tell you how to prepare for it.

Specialties
What do interventional cardiologists specialize in?
Interventional cardiology is a subspecialty of cardiology. There aren’t yet recognized subspecialties of interventional cardiology. In other words, there aren’t specific certifications. But doctors in this field may focus on specific areas and procedures, including:
Peripheral blood vessels
Structural heart issues
Adult congenital heart conditions
Chronic total occlusion
revascularization
Interventional cardiologists may also specialize in heart conditions that affect children (pediatrics).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Knowing you have a heart or blood vessel procedure coming up can cause some anxiety. But when you have an interventional cardiology procedure, a highly trained specialist will be caring for you. An interventional cardiologist can gather the information they need to make a diagnosis. Then, they can fix the issue without doing open-heart surgery.
