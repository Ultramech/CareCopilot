Orofacial Granulomatosis
Orofacial granulomatosis is a rare skin condition that causes swelling in your lips, mouth and face. It may be associated with other conditions, such as Crohn’s disease. Swelling is usually soft and painless at first, then more firm and painful over time. Corticosteroids and other treatments may help manage symptoms.

Cheilitis granulomatosa.
Granulomatous cheilitis.
Miescher cheilitis.
Who might get orofacial granulomatosis?
Orofacial granulomatosis isn’t common, affecting less than 1% of people. Although it can occur at any age, it’s more common in people who are 20 to 40 years old.
The condition can occur alone (idiopathic) or with other conditions, such as:
Crohn’s disease
.
Sarcoidosis
.
Infectious diseases
, such as tuberculosis.
Orofacial granulomatosis is also often associated with
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome
, a neurological condition that involves three symptoms:
Swelling on your face or lips.
Ridges or grooves in your tongue.
Repeat episodes of
facial paralysis
(inability to move parts of your face).
Symptoms and Causes
What causes orofacial granulomatosis?
Scientists don’t know what causes orofacial granulomatosis. But they’re researching whether it’s related to:
Allergies or sensitivities to foods such as cinnamon, chocolate and certain preservatives.
Bacterial or fungal infections.
Immune responses in people with genetic abnormalities.
They believe that swelling occurs when granulomas block your
lymphatic system
, leading to
lymphedema
.
What are the symptoms of orofacial granulomatosis?
The most common early symptom of orofacial granulomatosis is soft, painless swelling of one or both lips. It occurs in your lower lip more often than in your upper lip. The swelling comes and goes, and it can last weeks or months. Swelling may eventually become rubbery, firm, painful and permanent.

Grooves or ridges on your tongue.
Mouth ulcers
or mucosal tags (bumps or small flaps of extra skin on the tissue inside of your mouth).

Swelling or bumpiness of your mouth, cheeks, gums,
tongue
, chin, eyes, forehead or scalp.
Is orofacial granulomatosis contagious?
Orofacial granulomatosis may spread to other areas of your face, but it isn’t contagious.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is orofacial granulomatosis diagnosed?
To diagnose this condition, a
dermatologist
must take a small sample of the swollen tissue (biopsy). A
pathologist
will analyze the tissue and confirm whether it contains noncaseating granulomas.
The healthcare provider may order other tests to diagnose related conditions, including:
Blood tests for infectious diseases such as
tuberculosis
.
Chest X-rays to look for sarcoidosis.
Colonoscopy
and blood tests to look for Crohn’s disease.
Patch tests for allergies or sensitivities.
Management and Treatment
How is orofacial granulomatosis treated?
Your healthcare provider might recommend treatment if the condition causes:
Concerns about the way you look.
Pain.
Trouble using your face or mouth properly.
The most common treatment involves corticosteroids. The type of steroid prescribed depends on how severe the condition is:
Topical steroids that you put on your skin, such as ointments, creams or mouthwashes.
Cortisone injections delivered into the swollen area.
Systemic steroids, usually prednisone, which is a pill that you swallow.
Your healthcare provider also may recommend:
Antibiotics
to fight infections.
Changes to your diet if any allergies have been identified.
Oral or topical drugs to suppress the immune system (
immunosuppressants
).
Surgery to reduce permanent swelling that interferes with speaking, eating or other important functions.
Is there a cure for orofacial granulomatosis?
Unfortunately, there’s no cure for orofacial granulomatosis yet. Treatments aim to manage symptoms and make people more comfortable.
