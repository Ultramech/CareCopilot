Blisters
or fluid-filled bumps on the skin near your fingernail.
Color changes to the skin around your nail, usually darker than your normal skin tone, or red to purple.
Swollen finger.
What causes herpetic whitlow?
The herpes simplex virus (type 1 or type 2) causes herpetic whitlow. You usually acquire it from contact with another person who has the virus, especially after contact with a cold sore or “fever” blister. The virus usually penetrates your skin if you have a cut.

Is herpetic whitlow contagious?
Yes, herpetic whitlow is contagious. The condition can spread from person to person through physical contact. The condition is most contagious when you have blisters on your skin. When blisters begin to crust, the virus is no longer contagious.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is herpetic whitlow diagnosed?
Your provider will diagnose herpetic whitlow based on the appearance of the signs and symptoms localized on your finger. The condition has a unique look on your skin. To confirm the diagnosis, your provider will provide a
PCR test

culture test

Management and Treatment

Treatment for herpetic whitlow focuses on the infection. It could include compresses two to three times per day, coupled with an oral or topical
antiviral
medication (
acyclovir
). An over-the-counter
pain reliever
(analgesic) treats pain.
How long does herpetic whitlow last?
Herpetic whitlow typically lasts about two weeks, sometimes longer if left untreated.
How do I manage herpetic whitlow?
Herpetic whitlow deserves good wound care. Use compresses and protection with bandages to prevent secondary infection. Covering your blisters also prevents the spread of the virus to others.
