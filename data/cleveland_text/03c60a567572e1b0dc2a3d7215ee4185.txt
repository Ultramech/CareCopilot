SAIDs (Formerly Known as Periodic Fever Syndromes)
SAIDs (systemic autoinflammatory diseases) are a group of disorders that cause recurring fevers. They most commonly affect children. Formerly known as “periodic fever syndromes,” most of these conditions are hereditary and result from a genetic variant. Treatment depends on the type of SAID, but it often includes lifelong use of medication.

What Are SAIDs?
SAIDs (systemic autoinflammatory diseases) are a group of disorders that cause frequent (recurring)
fevers
. These are fevers that keep coming back but aren’t caused by infections (like
viruses
or
bacteria
). An abnormality or regulation problem in your child’s natural (innate)
immune system
causes SAIDs. They used to be called periodic fever syndromes or recurrent fever syndromes.

Policy
Autoinflammatory diseases aren’t
autoimmune diseases
(like
rheumatoid arthritis
or
lupus
), in which your child’s acquired (adaptive) immune system malfunctions and mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
SAIDs are much rarer than autoimmune disorders. Most are passed down (hereditary) and result from a
genetic mutation
(variant).
SAIDs typically (but not always) start when your child is a baby or toddler. Your child will experience episodes, or attacks, that cause fevers and other symptoms. They may not have symptoms between episodes. While there’s no cure for SAIDs, many periodic fever syndromes have treatments that can relieve your child’s symptoms.
Types of autoinflammatory disease
Researchers know of about 60 autoinflammatory diseases, and they’re continuing to discover more. Some of the most common SAIDs are:
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)
.
FMF is the most common genetically diagnosed recurrent fever syndrome. It causes painful
inflammation
in your child’s abdomen, chest and
joints
.
Periodic fever, aphthous-stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA).
PFAPA affects children in early childhood, usually starting before 4 years old. Episodes may resolve after age 10.
Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS).
TRAPS may first appear during early to late childhood or into adulthood.
Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD).
Formerly known as hyper-IgD syndrome, this type of periodic fever syndrome typically starts before 1 year of age.
NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory diseases.
Formerly known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), this type consists of three different diseases (subtypes).
Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD)
.
AOSD starts in adulthood. It’s the adult counterpart of systemic
juvenile idiopathic arthritis
(JIA).
NOD-2-associated granulomatous disease (
Blau syndrome
).
This type typically begins before 4 years old. It primarily affects your child’s skin, eyes and joints.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of SAIDs
SAIDs symptoms typically start during childhood. The most common symptom of the condition is a periodic (episodic) fever. People generally may feel well and have no symptoms between attacks. Each type of autoinflammatory disease may produce different symptoms:
FMF
may cause inflammation and severe pain in your child’s abdomen, chest and joints. A
skin rash
may develop in your child’s lower legs or ankles.
PFAPA
may cause a
sore throat
,
mouth sores
and
swollen lymph nodes in your child’s neck
.
TRAPS
may cause
chills
and
muscle pain
in your child’s trunk (torso) and arms. They may develop a painful red rash that moves from their arms and legs to their torso.
MKD
may cause chills,
headaches
,
abdominal pain
,
loss of appetite
and
flu-like symptoms
.
NLRP3 diseases
may cause rashes, headaches, malaise,
joint pain
and pink eye (
conjunctivitis
).
AOSD
may cause rashes, joint pain and muscle pain. Some also experience sore throat, abdominal pain,
fatigue
and malaise.
Blau syndrome
may cause a skin rash on your baby’s arms, legs or torso They may also experience joint pain and
eye pain
.
Autoinflammatory disease causes
Most SAIDs are
genetic diseases
. A variant in a certain
gene
causes each syndrome. The most common types of autoinflammatory diseases and their genetic causes are:
FMF:
MEFV
gene, which provides instructions for how to make a protein called pyrin
PFAPA:
Unknown
TRAPS:
TNFRSF1A
gene, which provides instructions for how to make a protein called tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
MDK:
MVK
gene, which provides instructions for how to make a protein called mevalonic kinase
NLRP3 diseases:
NLRP3
gene, which provides instructions for how to make a protein called cryopyrin
AOSD:
Unknown
Blau syndrome:
NOD2
gene, which provides instructions for how to make a protein called NOD2
Complications of SAIDs
It’s important to get proper treatment because continued inflammation can cause
amyloidosis
(a buildup of protein in your
kidneys
), leading to permanent kidney damage.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose SAIDs
Diagnosing autoinflammatory diseases can be a challenge. Their symptoms mimic those of other serious conditions, like lupus and
lymphoma
. To be sure your child’s condition is accurately diagnosed and managed, it’s important to find a physician trained in inflammatory diseases (
rheumatologist
).
Your child’s rheumatologist will use several factors to diagnose SAIDs. They’ll ask about your child’s symptoms and their biological family history. Your child’s provider may suspect period fever syndrome if your child:

Frequently get fevers
Has a biological family history of periodic fevers
Comes from an ethnicity where periodic fevers are more common
Tests that are used
Your child’s rheumatologist may recommend several tests to make a diagnosis. These may include:
Lab tests.
Tests like
C-reactive protein
or
complete blood count
(CBC) can show signs of inflammation. These tests become positive during an attack and return to normal after an attack.
Urine test.
A
urine protein test
checks for high levels of protein in your urine. For MKD, a urine test for organic acid (acids that contain a carbon atom) will show high levels of mevalonic acid.
Genetic testing.
Genetic testing
can look for genetic variants. But in some children with SAIDs, gene variants aren’t found, so test results may come back negative.
Management and Treatment
Autoinflammatory disease treatment
SAIDs treatment depends on the type and severity. The diseases aren’t curable, but you can typically manage your child’s symptoms with medication. If your child has episodes a few times a year, they can usually take
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
to relieve their symptoms. If the disease is more severe, your child’s provider may offer you other treatment options, including:
FMF.
You can manage FMF with a medication called
colchicine
, which helps reduce inflammation. If they can’t take colchicine, your child can try
canakinumab
, a
biologic
.
PFAPA.
You may shorten episodes of PFAPA with steroids (usually
prednisone
). In some children, a medicine used to treat stomach ulcers (
cimetidine
) may treat symptoms.
TRAPS.
Canakinumab is often an effective treatment for TRAPS. You can also help relieve symptoms with prescription anti-inflammatory drugs like
glucocorticoids
.
MKD.
Canakinumab is an effective option for treatment of MKD. During an episode, NSAIDs or steroids may also be helpful.
NLRP3 diseases.
Canakinumab and other
immunomodulators
like
rilonacept
and
anakinra
treat NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory diseases effectively.
AOSD.
Various anti-inflammatory drugs treat AOSD, including steroids,
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
and biologics.
Blau syndrome.
Depending on their symptoms, your child may try
immunosuppressants
,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors
and/or topical eye medications.

Outlook / Prognosis
Does SAIDs go away?
Some autoinflammatory diseases are lifelong conditions. Others may last several years and then go away with age. Some conditions are lifelong disorders. But episodes may get milder and less frequent over time. Your child’s healthcare provider can provide specific details about your child’s disease.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Raising a child with an autoinflammatory disease can be challenging. If you also have a SAID, you can use your personal experiences to better advocate for your child’s care. You can also use your insight to help your child cope with this lifelong disease.
It’s important to seek care from experts familiar with the ins and outs of SAIDs. These healthcare providers can help manage your child’s symptoms, ensuring your child has the best childhood possible.
