Benign Tumor
A benign tumor, also known as a benign neoplasm or benign growth, is a noncancerous collection of cells. Unlike cancerous tumors, benign tumors are slow-growing and don’t spread to other areas of your body. They may not cause symptoms, but a large benign tumor may press on nearby tissue and organs. Treatment uses surgery to remove the tumor.

Overview
What are benign tumors?
Benign tumors are noncancerous. They’re a collection of abnormal cells that, unlike normal cells, multiply more than they should and don’t die. The abnormal cells form
tumors
as they multiply. Your healthcare provider may use the terms “benign neoplasm” or “benign growth” when talking about your condition.

Policy
A benign tumor may not cause symptoms that you would notice. They rarely cause serious medical issues. But your provider may recommend surgery to remove a large benign tumor that’s pressing on nearby tissue or organs.
Is a benign tumor still cancer?
A benign tumor isn’t a malignant (cancerous) tumor. It grows more slowly than a
cancerous tumor
, has even borders and, unlike cancerous tumors, it won’t spread to other parts of your body.
But there are specific types of benign tumors that can turn into
cancer
. For example, some types of
colon polyps
(masses of abnormal cells in your
colon
) may become cancerous. That’s why a healthcare provider would remove any colon polyps they find during a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer.
Types of benign tumors
You can have a benign tumor almost anywhere in your body. Tumor names reflect the part of your body where a tumor develops. Some common types of benign tumors are:
Adenomas
:
This type starts in epithelial tissue, the tissue that covers your organs and glands. They grow slowly and look like small mushrooms with a stalk.
Chondromas:
These form in your
cartilage
, the flexible connective tissue throughout your body that protects your bones and joints.
Fibromas
or fibroids:
These are benign tumors in the fibrous tissue in your
tendons
and
ligaments
. You can develop them almost anywhere in your body.
Hamartomas
:
This is a common type of
benign lung tumor
.
Hemangiomas
:
These are common benign tumors that grow from your
blood vessels
. They may look like red or purple bumps or raised areas on your
skin
.
Lipomas
:
These are lumps of fatty tissue right under your skin. They’re a type of
soft tissue benign tumor
and the most common type of benign tumor.
Lymphangiomas
:
This type typically affects children. It develops in their
lymphatic system
, causing fluid-filled sacs on children’s skin and the mucous membranes that line their mouth, nose and inner eyelids.
Meningiomas
:
These start in your
meninges
, the layer of tissue around your
brain
. They can press on your brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas are benign, but they can grow large enough to become life-threatening.
Myomas:
These benign tumors grow from smooth
muscle
. They may affect your
uterus
or gastrointestinal tract in your
digestive system
.
Neuromas:
This type develops within your
nerves
. Neuromas can grow anywhere in your body. Common neuromas include
schwannomas
,
neurofibromas
and ganglioneuromas.
Osteomas:
This is a type of
benign bone tumor
. Other common types are
chondroblastoma
and
enchondroma
.
Skin tumors:
There are many types of benign skin tumors. Some of the most common include
cherry angioma
,
sebaceous hyperplasia
,
seborrheic keratoses
,
dermatofibromas
and acrochordons (
skin tags
).

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of benign tumors?
Benign tumor symptoms vary depending on where the tumor develops. Here are some examples:
Bleeding:
Uterine fibroids
are an example of benign tumors that cause bleeding.
Changes in your skin:
Benign skin tumors may cause many different symptoms, from tiny red spots no larger than a pinhead and small bumps (cellular dermatofibromas) to clusters of skin tissue at the top of a tiny stalk (acrochordons).
Difficulty breathing:
Chondromas and hamartomas that affect your
airway
may make it hard for you to breathe.
Headaches
and
dizziness
:
A meningioma (benign tumor in your meninges) may cause several symptoms, but headache and dizziness are among the most common ones.
Loss of appetite
or weight loss:
A lipoma or fibroma pressing on your
stomach
may affect your appetite.
Pain:
Benign bone tumors often cause pain that doesn’t go away and gets worse.
What causes benign tumors?
Researchers don’t know exactly why certain cells begin to multiply and become benign tumors. Some tumors get started during
fetal development
. For example, your baby may have a lymphangioma if something affects their lymphatic system before they’re born. You may have lipomas because you have a family history of this kind of benign tumor.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are benign tumors diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms. They’ll do a
physical examination
to check for unusual lumps or bumps on your skin or under your skin. They may order the following tests:
Biopsy
:
During a biopsy, a healthcare provider removes a piece of tissue for a
pathologist
to examine under a microscope.
Imaging tests:
A
CT scan
,
MRI
or
ultrasound
can create detailed images of structures inside your body, including tumors.
X-ray
:
X-rays take pictures inside your body, often of bone.
Management and Treatment
How are benign tumors treated?
Treatment varies depending on factors like tumor type and your symptoms. For example, you may not need treatment if you have a benign tumor that’s not growing or causing any issues. In that case, a healthcare provider may recommend watchful waiting. In watchful waiting, your provider will schedule regular follow-ups so they can watch for changes in your body.
If there are changes, your provider may:
Prescribe medications to manage symptoms like pain or swelling.
Recommend surgery to remove a benign tumor that’s causing symptoms because it’s pressing on tissues or organs.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a benign tumor?
Most benign tumors grow slowly. You may not need treatment. But you may need to see your provider regularly so they can check on your overall health and look for any change in the tumor. Your provider will schedule regular checkups. They’ll also explain if there are specific changes that mean you should contact them.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Often, benign tumors don’t cause issues. If tests show you have one, let your healthcare provider know anytime you notice changes in your body that may be signs the tumor is growing. For example, if you know a lump on your arm is a benign tumor, let your provider know if the lump is getting bigger or starts to hurt.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between a benign tumor and a cyst?
A cyst is a fluid-filled bump. A benign tumor is a solid mass or collection of cells.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Maybe you wondered about a bump on your leg. It wasn’t growing, but it wasn’t going away. Or maybe you contacted a healthcare provider about the patch of purple bumps on your arm. But now, you know your symptoms were signs of a benign tumor. It’s not cancer, but it may be a little unnerving to realize there’s a clump of abnormal cells gathered somewhere in your body. You’ll probably want to know what to expect — from how fast the tumor could grow and whether you’ll have new symptoms or if you’ll need surgery. Don’t hesitate to ask your provider. They’ll understand your concerns and be glad to answer your questions.
