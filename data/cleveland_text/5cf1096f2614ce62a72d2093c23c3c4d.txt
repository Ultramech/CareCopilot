Overview
What is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)?
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is an infusion treatment that manages immunodeficiency disorders. Intravenous is the medical term for something that’s injected into your body through a vein. Immunoglobulin is a collection of immune system antibodies from donors. Your healthcare provider might call it an infusion of IVIG or IVIG therapy.

Immunodeficiency disorders suppress your
immune system
and keep it from working like it should. Your immune system is like your body’s built-in security system. Usually, it automatically detects substances that shouldn’t be in your body (like
viruses
,
bacteria
or toxins) and sends out special cells to eliminate them. Immunodeficiency disorders weaken your body’s natural ability to defend itself. This can make you more likely to get sick and experience more severe symptoms and complications when you do.
IVIG can strengthen your natural immune response, reduce your risk of getting sick and lessen the severity of illnesses when you do get them.
What is IVIG used for?
Healthcare providers use IVIG to manage immunodeficiency caused by health conditions or as a side effect of other treatments.
Some conditions that can suppress your immune system include:
HIV
.
COVID-19
.
Kawasaki disease
.
Lupus
.
Adult-onset Still’s disease
.
Myositis
and
polymyositis
.
Vasculitis
.
Sjögren’s syndrome
.
Diabetes
.
Immunodeficiency can be a side effect of some treatments, including:
Corticosteroids
.
Chemotherapy
.
Immunosuppressants
to treat some
autoimmune diseases
.
Treatment Details
How does an IVIG infusion work?
Intravenous immunoglobulin is made with collected
antibodies
from healthy donors. It’s similar to receiving a
blood transfusion
from donated
blood
. But instead of receiving blood, you’ll get antibodies to help strengthen your immune system’s natural defenses.

IVIG infusions can have antibodies from thousands of donors. This diversity makes sure the infusion can strengthen your body against a wide range of infections.
The donated antibodies are like an extra shift of workers showing up to help clear city streets after a bad snowstorm. They’ll work with your immune system’s natural antibodies to help fight off infections.
How do I prepare for an IVIG infusion?
You usually don’t need to do any special preparation for an IVIG treatment. You should be able to eat, drink and take all your usual medication. Ask your provider if you should change your usual routine before your appointment.
Your provider might need
blood tests
or other tests to check your overall health or monitor any changes before you start intravenous immunoglobulin.
What can I expect from an IVIG treatment?
A healthcare provider will inject an IVIG infusion into a vein in your arm. They’ll insert a needle into a vein and the intravenous immunoglobulin will slowly infuse into your body.
IVIG appointments can take a long time, up to several hours. Ask your provider how long your infusion will last ahead of time. You may want to bring something to read, watch or listen to while you wait.

Risks / Benefits
What are the advantages of IVIG therapy?
IVIG is a safe, effective way to manage immunodeficiencies. It’s safe for almost everyone to take, including pregnant
women
. It can work alongside other treatments or medications.
The biggest advantage is boosting your immune system’s strength. This will decrease your risk of getting sick, and can help reduce the severity of infections if you do.
Is intravenous immunoglobulin a high-risk medication?
No, IVIG doesn’t have a high risk of complications. IVIG side effects are rare during or after treatment. In fact, experts estimate that fewer than 5% of people experience moderate or severe side effects.

Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Headache
.
Fever
.
Chest pain
.
Back pain
.
Muscle pain (myalgia)

(urticaria) and itchy skin (
pruritus
).
High or low blood pressure (
hypertension
or
hypotension
).
Meningitis
.
Trouble breathing (
dyspnea
).
Reduced
kidney
function.
Recovery and Outlook
How long will I need IVIG?
You may only need one treatment. Most people need several infusions (usually weekly or monthly). Ask your provider how often you’ll need more rounds of intravenous immunoglobulin in the future. It’ll depend on what’s causing the immunodeficiency and how your body responds to the first few sessions.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your healthcare provider if you feel uncomfortable or notice any side effects during or after an IVIG infusion. Most minor side effects start soon after your first session, usually within a few hours or days.

Even if most side effects are mild and get better on their own, your provider needs to know about them. They’ll adjust your dosage (or how fast it flows into you) as needed for future infusions.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Intravenous immunoglobulin is a safe, low-risk treatment that can help your immune system stay strong. You might still get sick, but having IVIG infusions can reduce the severity of illnesses. This can make a big difference if something is weakening your natural immune system.
Talk to your healthcare provider if anything makes you uncomfortable during or after an IVIG infusion. They can adjust your dose for future sessions to reduce stress on your body.
