Overview
Unloader braces are the most common brace providers suggest for people with knee arthritis.
What is a knee brace?
A knee brace is a medical device that stabilizes your knee joint and holds it in place. Healthcare providers use braces to protect and support your knee after an injury. You might have to wear knee support after knee surgery. Providers sometimes call them orthoses.

What does a knee brace do?
A knee brace supports your knee and holds it in place. It keeps your knee in alignment. Braces are usually made of stiff plastic or metal. They have cushions and straps that wrap around your knee and leg.
A knee brace helps you avoid putting too much stress on your knee joint. It keeps your knee from moving too far or too suddenly. How much resistance and support a brace gives depends on which type you need.
Types of knee supports
The most common types of knee brace include:
Unloader knee braces:
Unloader braces get their name from how they support your knee. They help absorb some of your weight and “unload” pressure off your knee to other parts of your leg. They’re the most common type of brace healthcare providers suggest for knee arthritis.
Patellofemoral knee braces:
Patellofemoral braces protect and support your kneecap and the front of your knee.
Knee immobilizer braces:
These are knee braces you wear while you recover from surgery. They’re usually stiffer and prevent some (or all) movement.
Functional knee braces:
Functional braces help you safely use your knee. They prevent your knee from moving too much or too far in one direction. They’re the most common brace people wear after a knee injury.
Prophylactic braces:
Athletes wear these to prevent injuries. They’re especially popular in contact sports like football or rugby. Ask your healthcare provider if you should wear a prophylactic knee brace before you buy one.
Knee sleeves:
Knee sleeves are made of tight elastic material that lightly squeezes your knee. Some brands call them compression sleeves. They’re not actually braces. But they’re the most common type of knee support people wear.

Your healthcare provider will tell you where you can get a knee brace. You might need it custom-fitted. Some braces are available over-the-counter or at retail stores. Other types are only available with a prescription.
How do I put on a knee brace?
Most knee braces fit around your knee with stretchy elastic or Velcro®
straps. The brace should be snug and secure without being too tight. It shouldn’t hurt or feel like it’s cutting off circulation to your leg.
It might feel strange or like the brace is pushing your knee into alignment. Especially at first. But it should never hurt or make knee pain worse. Talk to your healthcare provider or physical therapist before wearing a new brace. They’ll help you get used to putting it on, wearing it and moving with it.
What are the benefits and risks of wearing a knee brace?
Knee braces are a quick, easy way to support your knee joint. They may relieve symptoms like pain and stiffness. They can also help you heal safely. And they can help you feel safer and more confident. Many people also find that wearing a knee brace helps relieve pain and other symptoms, especially if they have knee arthritis.
But a brace may not help. There haven’t been studies that can prove for sure that wearing a brace was the reason someone avoided an injury. And you can’t prevent some kinds of injuries, even with a brace. But many people who wear prophylactic knee braces feel safer and more secure. That extra peace of mind is all they need to stay active or compete.
Complications from wearing a knee support are rare. But they can include:
Skin irritation
Pressure sores
Nerve compression

How long do I need to wear my knee support?
How long you need to wear a knee brace depends on why you need it. Your healthcare provider will give you a recovery timeline after surgery or an injury.
Some people need to wear a knee brace when they’re physically active or during sports. Your provider may suggest that you always wear a brace. Or they’ll tell you when it’s safe to train, work out or play without one.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Visit a healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms:
Severe pain
Swelling that’s getting worse
Discoloration or bruising
Tingling
Numbness
You can’t move your knee or leg
