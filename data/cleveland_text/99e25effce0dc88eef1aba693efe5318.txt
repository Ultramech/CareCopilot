Abdominal Abscess
An abdominal abscess is a pocket of pus and infected fluid in your belly. Bacterial infections are the most common cause. Healthcare providers treat abdominal abscesses with antibiotics and by draining the abscesses. Without treatment, an abdominal abscess can lead to life-threatening conditions like sepsis and organ failure.

Overview
What is an abdominal abscess?
An abdominal
abscess
is when infected fluid (pus) builds up and forms a pocket (or abscess) in your abdomen (belly). The fluid can make you sick. You can develop sepsis if you don’t receive treatment, like antibiotics and a procedure to drain the abscess.

Abdominal abscesses happen for many reasons, most of which are out of your control. What you can do is get treatment as soon as you suspect there’s something going on in your belly. Treatment typically cures the condition. But without treatment, an abdominal abscess can be life-threatening.
Types of abdominal abscesses
Healthcare providers classify abdominal abscesses by the part of your belly that an abscess affects. Abdominal abscess types are:
Intraperitoneal abscesses
: This classification refers to abscesses that may develop below your
diaphragm
, your intestines, pelvis or
stomach
. You may also develop an abscess in the space between your diaphragm and
liver
(subphrenic abscess).
Retroperitoneal abscesses
: These are abscesses in your
kidneys
or
pancreas
.
Visceral abscess
: This classification refers to abscesses within a solid organ like your
spleen
or liver.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of an abdominal abscess?
The specific symptoms are different depending on the abscess’s location. If you’re like most people, your symptoms may include:
New, severe and constant pain that may be in your upper abdomen,
lower back
, shoulder or chest.
Fever
.
Loss of appetite
.
Nausea
.
Unexplained weight loss
.
What causes abdominal abscesses?
Like most abscesses, abdominal abscesses happen when you have a bacterial infection. When
bacteria
enter your body, your
immune system
sends white blood cells to get rid of the bacterial intruders.

This process causes
inflammation
that kills nearby tissue. When tissue dies, a pocket forms and fills with pus, creating an abscess. You may develop an abdominal abscess if you:
Have a bacterial infection that starts in your belly.
Have a condition — like
Crohn’s disease
,
diverticulitis
or
pelvic inflammatory disease
— that causes inflammation.
Develop an infection after abdominal surgery.
Have an injury, like a gunshot wound or stab wound, which lets bacteria into your belly.
Without treatment, an abdominal abscess can cause serious, life-threatening conditions like
sepsis
and
organ failure
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is an abdominal abscess diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical examination
. They’ll ask about your symptoms. They’ll order a
complete blood count
(CBC) and the following imaging tests:
Abdominal ultrasound
.
Chest X-ray
.
Computed tomography (
CT
) scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This is the most common test.
Magnetic resonance imaging (
MRI
) scan.
They may do a
fine needle aspiration
to get a sample of pus from the abscess. A medical
pathologist
will do tests to identify the bacteria that are causing the infection.
Management and Treatment
How is an abdominal abscess treated?
The treatment for an abdominal abscess is a combination of
antibiotics
to fight the infection and a procedure to drain pus from the abscess. Your healthcare provider may recommend they do percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD).
PAD involves placing a drain or catheter into the abscess so that pus can flow into a connected bag. Your provider uses a CT scan or MRI scan to guide the catheter into place. You may receive local
anesthesia
before the procedure so that you’re awake during the procedure but you don’t feel pain. You may need to keep the catheter and bag in place for a few days after the procedure so the abscess can drain completely.
Treatment complications
Percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) is a minimally invasive procedure. Like similar procedures, it may cause complications like:
Bleeding
.
Pain.
Surgical wound infection
.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have an abdominal abscess?
If you’re like most people, antibiotics to fight infection and treatment to drain pus from an abdominal abscess will eliminate the abscess. But abdominal abscesses happen because you have a condition that causes inflammation and infection. While treatment may clear up the bacterial infection, it won’t resolve the underlying condition.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your provider if you have symptoms like fever or persistent pain. These symptoms may mean you have another abdominal abscess.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Abdominal abscesses develop when bacteria find a way into your belly. Once there, bacteria set the stage for an abscess. Without treatment, an abdominal abscess can become a life-threatening medical situation. Having a condition like Crohn’s disease or diverticulitis increases the chance you’ll have an abdominal abscess. If that’s your situation, ask a healthcare provider about symptoms that may mean there’s an abscess developing in your belly. That way, you’ll know when you should contact a provider.
