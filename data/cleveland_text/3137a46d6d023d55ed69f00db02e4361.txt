diabetes
or
cancer
).
Have severe injuries, such as extensive burns or open wounds.

Almost any type of germ can cause septicemia. The ones most often responsible are bacteria, including:
Staphylococcus aureus
.
Streptococcus pneumoniae
.
E. coli

How does septicemia affect my body?
Septicemia can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. It can cause tissue damage, organ failure and even death.

The body usually can remove a small number of germs naturally. But if germs continue to grow and spread, that can lead to septicemia.
What are the signs of septicemia?
Early septicemia symptoms are:
High fever.
Chills.
Weakness.
Sweating.
Drop in blood pressure.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is septicemia diagnosed?
Septicemia diagnosis is based on:
Presence of septicemia symptoms.
Blood tests to identify a bacterium, virus or fungus.
Depending on your symptoms, you might need other tests to check for damage to tissues and organs.
Management and Treatment
How is septicemia treated?
Septicemia requires immediate treatment to prevent the condition from worsening to sepsis. Infections caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics. The type of antibiotic you need depends on the type of bacteria that caused the infection. If the infection is caused by a virus or fungus, treatment will include an antiviral or antifungal medication. Your healthcare provider also may recommend draining blood and fluid from the infected area.
How soon after septicemia treatment will I feel better?
If treatment is effective, you can start to feel better in weeks or months. More serious cases may take longer.
