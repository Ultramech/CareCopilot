Hypogastric Plexus Block
A hypogastric plexus block is a type of treatment to manage chronic pain in your uterus or ovaries, prostate or other parts of your pelvis. The medication used in a hypogastric plexus block numbs or destroys the nerves in your lower back. This prevents your body from sending pain signals to your brain, so you feel relief.

Overview
What is a hypogastric plexus block?
A hypogastric plexus block is a pain-relieving injection into a bundle of
nerves
near the bottom of your spine (the hypogastric plexus). Blocking the hypogastric plexus causes the nerves to stop carrying information about pain in your pelvic area. This can reduce pain in your lower abdomen.

What kind of healthcare provider performs a hypogastric plexus block?
Interventional
pain management
physicians perform the procedure. These are providers who specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions that cause pain.
What happens during a hypogastric plexus block?
During a hypogastric plexus block, your healthcare provider may:
Give you a
sedative
through a needle in a vein in your arm. This intravenous (IV) medication can relax you.
Guide you to lie on your stomach on an X-ray table.
Clean your skin and give you a local
anesthetic
injection to numb your lower back area.
Use an
X-ray
to guide two needles into your lower back.
Inject dye to confirm that the medication will go to the correct spot.
Inject pain medication into the plexus. This may include an anesthetic and/or a steroid.
Inject alcohol or phenol to destroy the nerves completely for long-term pain relief.
How long does a hypogastric plexus block take?
The procedure usually takes about 30 minutes. Then, you’ll stay for observation for at least 30 minutes. You should be able to go home shortly after an hour.
Will I be asleep during a hypogastric plexus procedure?
No, you’ll be awake during a hypogastric plexus procedure. Your provider will give you a sedative to relax you, but you won’t be asleep. Your healthcare provider may ask you questions during the procedure to assess your comfort level.
What can I expect after a hypogastric plexus block?
Your pelvic area may feel warm or “different” after the procedure. This is normal. Many people report feeling less pelvic pain 30 minutes after the injection.
It’s also normal to have bruising or soreness at the injection site. This may last for a couple of days. Let your provider know if you feel severe pain after the injection.

Recovery and Outlook
What is the recovery time after a hypogastric plexus block?
After the injection, you’ll need to rest at home. Avoid participating in strenuous activities for 24 hours. You can return to your normal physical activities the next day. You can eat and drink as you normally would immediately after the procedure.
Follow your provider’s instructions on when to restart your usual medications again. If you made any changes to your medications before the injection, your provider will tell you when it’s safe to get back to your normal schedule.
How long do hypogastric plexus blocks last?
Pain relief varies based on what medicine your provider uses during a hypogastric plexus block. For example, an anesthetic offers temporary pain relief, usually for hours or days. Steroids may offer longer pain relief, usually weeks to months. You may need multiple injections or a combination of different medicines for optimal relief. Your provider will let you know what to expect before the injection.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Contact your healthcare provider if pain increases or doesn’t go away. Let them know if you have side effects, like a fever, severe pain and swelling at the injection site, or weakness in your legs.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Living with chronic pain can seriously affect your mental and physical health. It can stop you from spending time with your loved ones or participating in activities you enjoy. Treatment options, like a hypogastric plexus block, may be an alternative if other types of pelvic pain relievers aren’t successful. You don’t have to just “live with” the pain. Talk to a healthcare provider about different ways to manage chronic pain if traditional options aren’t working out.
