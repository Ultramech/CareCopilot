Treatment Details
How does yoga therapy work?
Before you begin yoga therapy, you’ll meet with your yoga therapist. They’ll learn more about your health concerns, medical history and your desired outcomes. Then, the therapist will create a yoga therapy practice plan that considers your:
Physical needs and abilities.
Overall health.
Your age.
Your goals.
Following your session, your yoga therapist will give you a home practice plan based on your needs and goals. This home practice can support you in making progress and it encourages you to build a daily self-care routine.
What happens during yoga therapy?
Your yoga therapy session will include a variety of movements and stretches that increase your strength, flexibility and balance. Your yoga therapist may recommend that you wear comfortable clothes that allow you to move freely.
Typically, your practice will be done while seated in a chair and/or while standing with the chair nearby for extra support. Some examples of movements during a yoga therapy session include:
Guidance on how to sit and stand properly with awareness and best position for safety and function.
Movements for increasing range of motion and ease of movement in your joints.
Side bends to open the mid-body and to support better breathing.
A cat-cow pose, where you’ll inhale while lifting your heart, arching your back and lifting your tailbone. Then, you’ll exhale while rounding your back, tucking your tailbone and gazing at your belly. This stretch can help improve your posture. It also supports flexibility in your spine.
A spinal twist, where you’ll sit and gently turn your body to the right. You’ll relax your hands down, turn and look over your right shoulder while breathing. You’ll repeat these steps on the left side. Spinal twists support healthy digestion. They also tone and strengthen your core muscles, and may relieve some lower back pain.
While you’re moving, your yoga therapist will guide you in different breathing exercises. These breath practices can help you to de-stress and manage pain. Your session will end with a relaxation practice, which helps you settle your body and mind in order to find a place of peace and calm.
How long is a yoga therapy session?
An initial yoga therapy session takes between 30 minutes to 90 minutes. For the best results, your therapist will recommend you do yoga at home in between yoga therapy sessions. Sessions at home are usually shorter, averaging about 15 minutes each.
How often should I do yoga therapy?
Your yoga therapist and your healthcare provider will recommend how long and how often you should do yoga. The amount of time you practice yoga depends on your goals and lifestyle.

Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better after yoga therapy?
There’s no specified amount of time as to when you’ll start feeling better or seeing results after yoga therapy. You may feel more relaxed immediately following a session. It may take weeks to months before you see improvement in your strength and balance.
Is there anything I can do to make doing yoga therapy easier?
Yoga takes training and practice. Your first session will be very different from your 10th session. When you start yoga therapy, your yoga therapist will determine what exercises are right for you to start your practice safely. As you get more experience doing yoga, it’ll feel easier. You can slowly increase the difficulty of your movements under your therapist’s supervision. If a movement or stretch isn’t comfortable or causes pain, stop and ask for assistance. Your therapist can help you modify the movement or offer another that uses the same muscles but in a different form.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Talk to your healthcare provider before beginning yoga therapy or any other physical activities to make sure they’re safe for you. They may also make recommendations on what areas of your body to focus on, which you can relay to your yoga therapist. Always contact your healthcare provider if you experience ongoing pain or have new symptoms.
Additional Common Questions

What’s the difference between yoga and yoga therapy?
Many people think of yoga as exercise. You may join a local yoga studio or fitness center with the goal of improving your strength and flexibility as well as getting a good workout.
A yoga instructor will guide a group class through different yoga poses and practices, often at a fast pace in what’s known as a “flow.” The emphasis is on correct yoga techniques. Students usually come to class two to three times per week.
Yoga instructors have a minimum of 200 hours of training.
Someone coming to yoga therapy is looking for help or relief from symptoms or health conditions that are troubling them. A yoga therapist will guide you in an individual practice and focus on using various tools of yoga to improve function and reduce stress.
A session will include breathing exercises, physical postures, mindfulness and meditation with emphasis on relieving symptoms, avoiding injury and restoring wellness. Your yoga therapist will provide home practice instructions designed specifically to build a safe and effective self-care routine. The number of sessions you have will depend on your health goals and progress, and it’s usually once or twice a month for a few months.
Yoga therapists have a minimum of 1,000 hours of training.
