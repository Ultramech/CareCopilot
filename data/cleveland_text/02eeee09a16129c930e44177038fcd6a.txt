Ego
Your ego is the part of your personality that helps you stay grounded, make wise choices and manage emotions. When it’s in balance, you feel confident and in control. But if things feel off, like being overly self-critical or reactive, your ego might need support. A mental health professional can help.

What is the Ego?
The ego is the part of your personality that helps you make practical, rational decisions. It acts as a middle ground, balancing your instincts and desires (the id) with your morals and conscience (the superego).

This idea comes from Sigmund Freud, who introduced it over 100 years ago. His theory suggested that early childhood experiences and unconscious conflicts shape your current thoughts, emotions and behaviors.
Today, the word “ego” is often used to describe someone who seems self-centered or temporarily feels really good about themselves (“ego boost”). But it has a major role in the field of psychology.
What is the ego in psychology?
Psychology explains how your ego helps you in daily life. It supports your ability to:
Adapt to your environment
Regulate your emotions
Feel like yourself
This approach builds on Sigmund Freud’s original theory, which described a balance between unconscious desires (the id) and conscious morality (the superego).
Psychologists
built on his ideas. They showed how your ego helps you stay strong and deal with life’s challenges.
What are the functions of the ego?
Your ego helps you manage daily life by keeping your thoughts, feelings and behaviors in check. It plays several key roles:
Reality testing
: Telling the difference between your thoughts and the world around you
Judgment
: Thinking through consequences before acting
Regulation
: Managing intense emotions or impulses in a healthy way
Relationships
: Supporting mature interactions with others
Thought process
: Using memory, logic and focus to think clearly
Defensive functioning
: Coping with
stress
or negative thoughts

You can think of the ego like a scale with two weights. The id (your impulsive side) is on the left and the superego (your moral compass) is on the right. The ego’s job is to balance these two. Most of the time, this balancing act happens automatically. You’re not consciously thinking about it.
Here’s how your ego might show up in a stressful moment.
You get an email from a coworker asking you to do a task that’s actually their responsibility. The deadline is in an hour. Meanwhile, they’re in the break room chatting with colleagues, leaving you to handle the work alone. You feel a surge of anger, but you don’t act on it. That’s your ego stepping in:
Judgment: You realize that yelling could hurt your professional reputation. Instead, you choose to talk to your coworker privately instead of calling them out in front of others.
Regulation: You manage your frustration and stay calm during the conversation.
Defensive functioning: You handle the stress by addressing the issue directly, without escalating it.
In this moment, your id might push you to lash out or ignore the request. Your superego might pressure you to say nothing and take on the task anyway. Your ego finds the middle ground.
But when your ego isn’t working well, emotions can take over. That’s a sign the balance may be off.
What does a balanced ego feel like?
You might feel the following if your ego is balanced:
Accepting of your flaws
Adaptable to change
Empathetic
Focused
Humble
Open to criticism
Self-aware
Resilient
Off-balance ego symptoms
If your ego is off balance, you might feel:
Disconnected or withdrawn
Focused on approval from others
Overly self-critical
Emotionally unstable
Defensive or unable to handle rejection
Self-centered
Superior to others
Experts link imbalances to
mental health conditions
. These could include
personality disorders
(like
narcissistic personality disorder
) and
mood disorders
(like
depression
and
anxiety
).
Ego defense mechanisms
Defense mechanisms are ways your mind protects you from stress or pain, without you even knowing it. Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud’s daughter, identified 10 common types:
Regression
: Reverting to childlike behavior or emotions (an adult throwing a tantrum)
Reaction formation
: Acting the opposite of how you really feel (being nice to someone you disagree with)
Isolation
: Separating thoughts from emotions (talking about
grief
without showing emotion)
Undoing
: Trying to cancel out something bad with something good (giving compliments after thinking a negative thought about someone)
Repression
: Pushing painful memories out of your mind (forgetting an embarrassing childhood experience)
Projection
: Putting your negative feelings on someone else (accusing someone else of being angry when you’re mad)
Introjection
: Taking on other people’s traits as your own (repeating negative criticism that you learned from your parents)
Turning against the self
: Pointing negativity toward yourself (taking the blame when it isn’t your fault)
Reversal
: Doing the opposite of what’s expected to cope with stress (laughing during a sad scene in a movie)
Sublimation
: Putting impulsive energy into socially acceptable behaviors (playing contact sports)

Theorists originally saw these as ways the ego protected itself from the id’s urges. Today, psychologists view them as natural coping tools that help you adapt to stress. Recognizing defense mechanisms can help you better understand how your thoughts influence your behaviors.
How do I improve my ego?
Ego imbalances can affect your mental health. If you’re having a hard time, you might want to talk with a mental health professional. They can help you understand what’s causing your symptoms.
One common approach is talk therapy (
psychotherapy
). This is where you’ll learn about and adjust unhealthy thoughts, emotions and behaviors through meaningful conversations.
During therapy, your provider might use strategies like:
Cognitive restructuring
: Reframing negative thoughts into more positive, helpful ones
Behavioral changes
: Practicing healthier ways to cope with stress and letting go of bad habits
There are different types of therapy available, each tailored to your personal goals.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
You might not think about your ego, but it’s always working in the background. It keeps you grounded and helps you make smart choices. When it’s in balance, you can manage emotions, maintain healthy relationships and feel confident in who you are.

But sometimes, things feel off. You might be overly self-critical, disconnected or have trouble managing stress. These are things a mental health professional can help you with. They can identify what’s going on to guide you toward a more balanced ego.
