Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a genetic overgrowth disorder that can affect many different parts of your child’s body. Most babies are large at birth and have other symptoms across a wide spectrum. BWS also increases your child’s risk for developing certain childhood cancers. BWS can’t be cured, but there are many treatments available.

What Is Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome?
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects your child’s growth. It can affect many different parts of your child’s body.
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects your child’s growth. Most babies with BWS are larger than normal (
macrosomia
). Some may be taller than other children their age. But your child’s growth should slow down by the age of 8. They should be of average height in adulthood.

BWS is also known as Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum. This is because the symptoms and their severity vary widely. The condition can affect many different parts of your child’s body. Your child may have only one or many of its characteristics. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome also increases your child’s risk of developing certain childhood cancers.
There’s no cure for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. But there are many treatments available to correct physical differences and relieve your child’s symptoms. BWS usually doesn’t cause any serious medical issues. Life expectancy is typically normal.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the characteristics of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome symptoms can vary widely from child to child. Characteristics that your child may have include:
Abdominal organs that develop outside their belly (
omphalocele
)
Abnormally large tongue (
macroglossia
)
Above average birth weight (above the 95th percentile)
Enlarged liver (
hepatomegaly
)
Kidney abnormalities
Low blood sugar (
hypoglycemia
) in the newborn period
One side of their body is larger than the other (
hemihyperplasia
)
Tiny creases or indentations on their earlobes
Tissue bulge around their belly button (umbilical hernia)
What cancers are children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome at risk of developing?
Overall, children with BWS have about a
7.4%
chance of developing cancer, with almost all of the risk increased between birth and the age of 8. These cancers include:

Adrenocortical carcinoma
Hepatoblastoma
Neuroblastoma
Rhabdomyosarcoma
Wilms tumor
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome causes
The causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are complex. Researchers link most cases of BWS to certain
epigenetic
changes on chromosome 11. These changes affect the normal expression of genes on the portion of chromosome 11 (11p15.5) that controls growth. This is called genomic imprinting.
About 85% of children born with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome don’t have a biological family history of the condition. Instead, the epigenetic changes happen randomly.
About 10% to 15% of children have a family history of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. That means one parent passed down a genetic change that causes BWS.
Unknown causes lead to the diagnosis in about 14% to 20% of children born with the condition.
Risk factors
Research into the cause of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome shows that people who use assisted reproductive technology (ART) to conceive may have a higher risk of having a baby with a genomic imprinting disorder like BWS. These ART procedures include
in vitro fertilization (IVF)
and
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
. Scientists have to do more research to find the connection.
In addition, studies suggest that BWS is more common in twin pregnancies than in pregnancies with just one fetus.
Complications of this condition
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can lead to preterm labor. After your baby is born, they can develop breathing and feeding difficulties, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and
cardiomyopathy
.
Complications that can occur from childhood through adulthood include:
Calcium deposits in their kidneys
Cognitive impairment
Kidney cysts
Kidney stones
Male infertility
Scoliosis
Speech issues
Urinary tract infections
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
Your healthcare provider may be able to diagnose Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome before birth. Using a prenatal ultrasound, they can detect features of the condition, including:
Enlarged kidney (nephromegaly)
Enlarged placenta
Increased amniotic fluid around the fetus (
polyhydramnios
)
Larger fetus size than expected
Macroglossia
Omphalocele
If the ultrasound reveals potential signs of BWS, your provider can use prenatal genetic tests to confirm a diagnosis. These tests include
amniocentesis
and
chorionic villus sampling
.
After birth, your provider can diagnose or confirm the condition with a physical examination and genetic testing.
Management and Treatment
How is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome treated?
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can affect many different parts of your child’s body. Because of this, you’ll work with many healthcare providers and specialists to address the specific symptoms and conditions affecting your child.

Macroglossia, or an enlarged tongue, is a common feature of BWS. A larger tongue size can cause sleeping, feeding and speaking issues. So, providers may use various treatments, including:
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
to treat obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep issues
Specialized nipples or a
nasogastric tube
for feeding issues
Speech therapy for speech difficulties
Tongue reduction surgery
Other Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome treatment options may include:
IV (intravenous) glucose, frequent feedings and certain medications to treat hypoglycemia
Medications, surgery or other interventions to treat cardiac, gastrointestinal and kidney issues
Orthotics or surgical correction to reduce the appearance of leg length differences due to hemihyperplasia
Stomach wall surgery to treat omphalocele (and umbilical hernia, if it doesn’t go away on its own)
Your provider may also recommend genetic counseling for you and your family to help you learn more about your child’s condition.
When should my child see their healthcare provider?
You and your child will work with a team of healthcare providers to help manage your child’s condition. Your child will need regular check-ups so their providers can monitor their symptoms. Alert your child’s provider about any new or worsening symptoms.

All children with BWS have a higher risk of developing childhood cancers. They’ll need routine cancer screenings so their healthcare provider can find and treat cancer before it spreads.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook (prognosis) for a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a complex condition that can affect your child in many ways. The prognosis for your child depends on many factors, including:
Which body parts are affected
How severe their symptoms are
Time of diagnosis
Whether tumors develop
Early diagnosis and treatment, along with routine cancer screenings, can lead to the best outcome. Most children who develop Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a normal life expectancy.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It may have come as a shock to learn that your child has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Their diagnosis may have left you with lots of questions about what this means for your child’s health. BWS can’t be cured. But medical treatments can help resolve most of your child’s symptoms. Ask your child’s healthcare provider what medical challenges your child may face. They’ll have insight into your child’s specific situation. That way, you can understand how BWS may affect your child and what you can do to help them thrive.
