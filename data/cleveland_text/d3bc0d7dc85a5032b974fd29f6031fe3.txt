What does a clinical nurse specialist do?
Clinical nurse specialists provide direct care, as well as indirect care.
Direct care is what you or your loved ones see or experience firsthand. This may include:
Giving you a
physical exam
Giving you treatments
Helping you learn to use medical equipment
Teaching you and your family about your condition
Indirect care usually happens in places where you can’t see it (like in offices or meeting rooms). But it still affects you. This is because it shapes the procedures healthcare providers follow and the resources they can access. Clinical nurse specialists often try to change bigger-picture issues that affect many people in hospitals.
For example, they may use data on hospital-acquired infections (like
C. diff
) to find better ways to identify and treat them. They may also teach and mentor other nurses. Some clinical nurse specialists work with community organizations that support people’s health. Overall, a CNS often engages in behind-the-scenes work that helps improve the quality of healthcare that you and others receive. A CNS may also perform research and investigate problems.
