Pleurodynia
Pleurodynia causes sharp pains in your chest or abdomen that come on suddenly. It might make you sweat and your heart race. It’s caused by an inflammation in your muscles from a viral infection (most commonly, coxsackie B). Pleurodynia usually goes away on its own in a few days. You should always check with a provider if you have chest pain.

Overview
What is pleurodynia?
Pleurodynia (pronounced “plur-uh-DIN-ee-uh”) is a side effect of a
viral infection
that affects your muscles. It causes sharp, stabbing
pains in your chest
or
abdomen
. The pain comes in waves or spasms and can last 15 to 30 minutes. Kids are more likely to get abdominal or stomach pain and adults are more likely to get chest pain.

Pleurodynia is also called Bornholm’s disease, or, more colorfully, “the grip of the phantom” and “devil’s grip.” The two parts of the word “pleurodynia” mean “side” (pleur) and “pain” (dynia).
What’s the difference between pleurodynia and pleurisy?
The chest pain you get with pleurodynia comes from inflammation in the muscles in your chest, between your ribs (intercostal muscles), or from your
diaphragm
. Chest pain from
pleurisy
comes from inflammation of the linings of your lung (pleurae), causing them to rub together.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of pleurodynia?
People with pleurodynia have sharp spasms of knife-like pain in their chest or abdomen. They come on suddenly and can last 15 to 30 minutes. Your heart might race or you might sweat a lot during the attacks. Your muscles probably feel sore if you press on them.
Some people also have:
Fever
.
Fatigue
.
Headache
.
Sore throat
.
What causes pleurodynia?
Inflammation in the muscles of your chest or diaphragm due to a viral infection cause pleurodynia. Coxsackie B virus is the most common cause of the infection. Coxsackie A virus and some echoviruses can also cause it.
Is pleurodynia contagious?
The
viruses
that cause pleurodynia are contagious. Usually, when one person gets pleurodynia, they can spread the virus to those around them. Outbreaks can happen where groups of people can all get it at once (epidemic pleurodynia).

How does pleurodynia spread?
The viruses that cause pleurodynia spread through contact with an infected person’s poop (feces), spit (
saliva
) or snot (mucus from their
nose
). You can get pleurodynia from:
Being in close contact with someone who has it. This includes touching, hugging and shaking hands.
Objects or surfaces that have the virus on them. If someone with pleurodynia touches something like a doorknob, phone or countertop, it can become contaminated with the virus. If you touch the same object, then touch your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, you can get infected.
Changing the diapers of someone who’s infected. It’s important to wash your hands after changing diapers, before you touch surfaces or your eyes, nose or mouth.
Drinking contaminated water.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is pleurodynia diagnosed?
Healthcare providers usually diagnose pleurodynia based on your symptoms. But you might need tests to rule out serious conditions that cause chest pain. Tests might include:
Chest X-rays
to look for heart or lung conditions that could be causing pain. These are usually normal when you have pleurodynia.
Blood tests
to look for signs of infection.
Stool (poop) tests to look for signs of specific viruses,
bacteria
or other causes of your symptoms.
Management and Treatment
How do you get rid of pleurodynia?
There are no
antiviral medications
that treat pleurodynia. You can manage your symptoms at home by:
Taking pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications. These include
acetaminophen
(Tylenol®) or
NSAIDS
(Advil®, Motrin®, Aleve®).
Using heat packs on the muscles that hurt.

Outlook / Prognosis
How long does pleurodynia last?
Pleurodynia usually lasts just a few days, but sometimes can take two to three weeks to fully get better. It usually goes away on its own without causing serious problems.
When should I see a healthcare provider?
If a provider has already diagnosed you with pleurodynia, ask when you should follow up with them. If you don’t feel like you’re getting better after a few days or if you have additional symptoms, contact your provider.
When should I go to the ER?
Chest pain can be a sign of serious conditions that need immediate medical attention. You should always go to the emergency room if you’re having severe chest pain.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It may be helpful to ask a healthcare provider:
How can I manage my symptoms?
When should I follow up with you?
How long will it take to feel better?
What new or worsening symptoms should I look out for?
Prevention
Can pleurodynia be prevented?
Washing your hands
frequently is the best way to reduce your risk of pleurodynia. It’s especially important before eating and after going to the bathroom or changing diapers. Other ways to reduce the spread of pleurodynia include:
Advertisement
Wash fruits and vegetables with clean water. Wash, peel or cook fruits and vegetables before eating.
If you’re unsure if drinking or cooking water is clean, use bottled water.
Teach kids good handwashing hygiene at a young age.
Make sure kids wash their hands after going to the bathroom and before eating.
Avoid close contact, like hugging, kissing or shaking hands with someone who’s sick with an
infectious disease
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Chest pains are alarming and always a reason to check in with a healthcare provider. If a provider diagnoses you with pleurodynia, the pain should be manageable with over-the-counter medication and go away on its own in a few days. Never hesitate to ask your provider about concerns you have or how best to manage your symptoms until you feel better.
