Tooth Luxation
Tooth luxation (tooth dislocation) happens when the tissues, ligaments and bones that support a tooth become damaged. Dental trauma and infection can cause it. Symptoms vary depending on the type of tooth luxation. In many cases, treatment can stabilize your tooth and reduce your risk for future issues.

Overview
What is tooth luxation?
Tooth luxation (tooth dislocation) happens when infection (like
gum disease
) or trauma (like a fall) disrupts the tissues,
ligaments
and
bones
that hold a tooth in place. It can also affect your tooth’s
nerves
and blood supply, leading to
pulp
damage.

Your
teeth
sit within the alveolar bone, the part of your jaw that contains your tooth sockets. Connective tissue fibers called periodontal ligaments attach the root of each tooth to your alveolar bone. Tooth luxation can affect all these structures.
No matter what causes it, tooth luxation can seriously impact your ability to eat and speak. It also leaves the door open for
bacteria
to invade the nooks and crannies around your tooth. There are treatment options that can help stabilize your tooth and keep your pulp healthy.
Types of tooth luxation
Tooth luxation can range from mild to serious. The five types of luxated teeth, in order of severity, are:
Luxation type
Extent of damage
Tooth positioning
Telltale signs/symptoms
Concussion
Injury to periodontal tissues (the structures that support your tooth)
Tooth hasn’t moved
Feels tender to the touch
Subluxation
Injury to periodontal tissues
Tooth is loose but hasn’t moved from original location
Feels tender to the touch; bleeding
Extrusive luxation
Periodontal ligaments separate
Tooth has moved out of its socket, but the socket is still intact
Tooth is loose; looks longer than usual
Lateral luxation
Your alveolar bone (the bone that holds your teeth) fractures and periodontal ligaments separate
Tooth isn’t loose but looks angled either forward or backward from your gumline
Your provider hears a high-pitched metallic (ankylotic) sound when they tap your tooth
Intrusive luxation
Your alveolar bone fractures
Tooth moves up into its socket
Your provider hears an ankylotic sound when tapping your tooth

How common is tooth luxation?
Anyone can have tooth luxation, but it’s most common in children and young adults. In the United States:
Luxation of permanent (adult) teeth makes up 18% to 33% of all dental injuries.
Luxation of primary (baby) teeth makes up 21% to 81% of all dental injuries.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a luxated tooth?
A luxated tooth might be loose, angled or move out of the socket. In some cases, you might have tenderness, but no visible signs.
Luxated tooth symptoms may include:
Bleeding gums
Loose tooth
Tooth pain
Tooth sensitivity
What causes tooth luxation?
Dental trauma
is the most common cause of tooth luxation, including:
Bicycle accidents
Car accidents
Sports injuries
Violent assaults

Other causes of tooth luxation include:
Tooth decay
Gum disease
Complications of tooth luxation
Possible complications of tooth luxation include:
Ankylosis.
This is when your tooth fuses to the bone and starts sinking into your
gum
tissue.
Apical
periodontitis
. This is inflammation that starts around your tooth’s root tip.
Inflammatory root resorption
.
This is a breakdown of your tooth’s root structure, which can cause your tooth to loosen
Pulp canal obliteration (PCO)
. This involves hard tissue deposits along the walls of the root canal. PCO is usually painless but can lead to pulp necrosis (tissue death).
Pulp necrosis
. This happens when your tooth pulp dies. If you have pulp necrosis, your dentist may need to
extract
the whole tooth.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is tooth luxation diagnosed?
To diagnose a luxated tooth, a
dentist
will ask about your symptoms and prior injuries. They’ll also do a
physical examination
.
During the exam, your dentist will:
Check your tooth for any mobility (looseness).
Do a pulp sensibility test to see whether there’s damage to the pulp.
See whether your tooth is sensitive or tender to the touch.
Take
X-rays
of your teeth.
Tap your tooth to listen for high-pitched, metallic (ankylotic) sounds.
Management and Treatment
How is tooth luxation treated?
The goal of tooth luxation treatment is to stabilize your tooth and keep the pulp healthy. Depending on the type and severity of luxation, your dentist may:
Apply calcium hydroxide to prevent
inflammation
inside your tooth
Check the health of your tooth pulp during regular checkups
Do a
root canal
and place a
dental crown
Reposition your tooth
Splint teeth together for stability (this typically takes two to four weeks, depending on the type of luxation you have)

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for tooth luxation?
Prompt treatment can save a luxated tooth in many cases, and it may serve you for many years. But providers can’t predict or guarantee how long your tooth might last.
If you have severe damage, your dentist may recommend removing your tooth and replacing it with a
bridge
or
dental implant
. Your dentist can help you weigh your treatment options.
Prevention
Can tooth luxation be prevented?
In many cases, tooth luxation results from accidental trauma — and you can’t always prevent that. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk:
Wear a seatbelt when in a vehicle.
Wear a helmet when skating or riding a bike.
Wear a
mouth guard
if you play contact sports.
To reduce your risk of infection-related tooth luxation:
Practice good
oral hygiene
.
Visit your dentist for regular exams and
cleanings
.

How do I take care of myself?
To help protect your tooth after luxation repair, you should:
Brush gently with a soft toothbrush after each meal
Eat soft foods for one week
Rinse with an antibacterial mouthwash two times a day for one week
Take
NSAIDs
as needed for pain relief
Visit your dentist for regular checkups

When should I see my dentist?
After tooth luxation treatment, tell your dentist if you develop any new or worsening symptoms like
tooth discoloration
or continued pain, bleeding or swelling.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between luxation and avulsion?
Tooth luxation and avulsion are different types of dental damage. Tooth luxation happens when the tissues and ligaments that hold your tooth in its socket become damaged.
Avulsion
refers to a completely knocked-out tooth. In other words, your tooth is no longer in its socket.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Chances are, you don’t think much about your teeth until something happens to one of them. Maybe someone bumped you in the mouth during softball practice. Or maybe you fell off a ladder and hit your tooth on the way down.
Now, you can’t eat or speak without being aware of your new injury. Tooth luxation doesn’t always require treatment — but it does require immediate medical attention. The sooner you get a dental evaluation, the better your chances of saving your tooth.
