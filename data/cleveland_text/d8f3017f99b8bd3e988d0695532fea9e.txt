Basophilia
Basophilia is when your body produces too many basophils. Basophils are white blood cells that protect your body from infections. You may learn you have high basophils on a blood test. Basophilia may be a sign you have an infection or allergies, or it may indicate a serious medical condition like leukemia or an autoimmune disease.

Overview
What is basophilia?
Basophilia is when your basophil count is unusually high on a
blood test
.
Basophils
are one of the five
white blood cell
types that protect your body from infections and fight intruders like parasites, fungi and cancer cells. They drive your body’s reaction to allergens.

High basophil levels may be a sign your body is reacting to an allergen or fighting an infection. Sometimes, high basophils are a sign of serious medical conditions like leukemia or an autoimmune disease. Your healthcare provider will need to do more tests to be sure.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of basophilia?
Basophilia doesn’t cause symptoms. Instead, you may have symptoms of a condition that caused your high basophil count. Signs and symptoms of conditions that may cause basophilia include:
Fever
Fatigue
Frequent infections
Itching
Skin rashes
Swelling (
inflammation
)
It’s important to remember that symptoms vary based on what’s causing your high basophils. And while some causes are serious, others aren’t. That’s why it’s important to have a healthcare provider examine you if you’re noticing unexplained changes in your body.
What causes basophilia?
Several things can cause your basophil count to be high. Sometimes, basophilia is a sign of a chronic (long-term) medical condition, like cancer. Other times, it indicates your body is battling a persistent infection or fending off an allergen.
Conditions that can cause basophilia include:
Allergic reaction to a
food
,
medication
or an allergen in your
environment
Infections
Hypothyroidism
Inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD)
Autoimmune diseases
(including
rheumatoid arthritis
and
multiple sclerosis
)
Myeloproliferative neoplasms
(including
polycythemia vera
and
myelofibrosis
)
Leukemia
(including
acute
and
chronic
myeloid leukemia)

Diagnosis and Tests
How is basophilia diagnosed?
Healthcare providers typically diagnose basophilia by taking samples of your
blood
so they can perform a test called a
complete blood count
(CBC). This test shows the number and condition of your white blood cells, your
red blood cells
and your
platelets
.
As basophils are a type of white blood cell, your provider may do a CBC with differential. This test details how many basophils and other white blood cells you have. Your provider can do this test on the same blood sample they use for a CBC.
Still, basophilia is more of a sign that something else is going on than it is a diagnosis. If your tests show a high basophil count, your provider might perform a
physical exam
and run more tests to find out what’s causing basophilia.
Management and Treatment
How is basophilia treated?
Healthcare providers treat basophilia by treating the medical condition that’s causing it. Common treatments include:
Antibiotics
for bacterial infections
Antiparasitic medications
to kill parasites
Antihistamines
to calm an allergic reaction
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
or
corticosteroids
to calm inflammation and ease pain
Treatment for long-term conditions like
blood cancer
will be more complex. Your provider will explain your options based on your diagnosis.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have basophilia?
If your healthcare provider is confident your high basophils are a sign of a temporary reaction, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, they may perform another CBC later to confirm your levels are back to normal.
In some cases, they’ll need to rule out more serious conditions. In that situation, you’ll need more tests before your provider can pinpoint what’s causing your basophilia. The treatment you’ll need depends on what the underlying issue is.
Prevention
How can I prevent basophilia?
You can take steps to steer clear of allergens and reduce your risk of getting sick, but you can’t prevent all causes of basophilia. The best thing you can do is see a healthcare provider as soon as possible if you’re experiencing unusual symptoms. You can also ask if you should be concerned about elevated basophil levels flagged on your blood test.

How do I take care of myself?
If you have basophilia, try to remain patient. It can be confusing (and worrying) to get abnormal results on a blood test. But don’t assume the worst. Remember that your basophil levels are just one small piece of the puzzle that helps your provider assess your health. They’ll need more information before they know what’s going on in your body.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your healthcare provider if you have long-lasting fatigue or signs of an infection or allergic reaction. These may be signs of a condition that causes basophilia.
Go to the ER or your emergency healthcare provider immediately if you have signs of a
severe allergic reaction
, like
difficulty breathing
.

Regardless of the cause, it’s important to get checked out when you notice unexplained changes in your body. The sooner you receive treatment, the sooner you can start feeling better.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Questions you may want to ask if you have basophilia include:
Should I be concerned about my basophilia?
What’s likely causing my high basophils?
Will I need more tests to find out why my basophil count is too high?
When should I expect follow-up test results?
Will I need treatment?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A blood test result that shows you have high basophils can mean a lot of things. Basophilia may mean your body is fighting allergies or an infection. It may be a sign of more serious conditions. Your healthcare provider will need to run more tests to be sure. As with any abnormal test results, try not to assume the worst. Your provider is your best resource for explaining what your results mean and what the next steps will be.
