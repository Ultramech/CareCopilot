Periodic Breathing in Newborns
Periodic breathing is when your newborn alternates between short pauses in breathing and several quick breaths. It’s usually harmless and stops by 6 months of age. Seek medical care right away if your baby goes longer than 10 seconds without breathing, their skin changes color or you can’t wake them up.

What is periodic breathing in newborns?
Periodic breathing is a common breathing pattern in
newborns
. It’s when your baby has a brief pause in their breathing. The pause usually lasts five to 10 seconds. Then, your baby starts breathing again on their own. Those first few breaths after the pause are usually fast (
tachypnea
).

Your baby might repeat this cycle (a pause in breathing followed by fast breathing) three or more times in a row. They then settle back into a steady rhythm. Periodic breathing typically happens while your baby is sleeping. As your newborn grows, their body learns to regulate their breathing, and periodic breathing cycles stop.
Periodic breathing is considered a type of irregular breathing. But it’s expected in newborns and usually not a cause for concern.
At what age is periodic breathing normal?
Periodic breathing is normal up to 6 months of age. It’s most likely to happen when your baby is 2 to 4 weeks old. If periodic breathing continues beyond 6 months, tell your
pediatrician
.
Is periodic breathing abnormal?
Sometimes, but it’s rare. Periodic breathing cycles are usually temporary, and your baby returns to a steady breathing rhythm on their own. But it’s possible for periodic breathing cycles to keep happening over and over for longer than expected. This can keep your baby from taking in enough oxygen.
When your baby can’t take in enough oxygen, their
blood-oxygen
level drops (
hypoxemia
). This is dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.
Call 911 (or your local emergency service number) or take your baby to the emergency room if:
They stop breathing for longer than 10 seconds
Their skin and/or lips start to change color to
blue
, yellow-gray, gray, purple or white
You can’t wake your baby

Skin color change is a sign of low blood-oxygen levels. Babies with lighter skin tones may start to turn blue. Babies with darker skin tones may start to turn gray, yellow-gray or white.
What is the difference between apnea and periodic breathing?
Apnea is a medical diagnosis that has many possible causes. On the other hand, periodic breathing is an expected breathing pattern for infants up to 6 months of age. Let’s take a closer look at what this means for your baby.
If your infant is diagnosed with apnea, it means they stop breathing for 20 seconds or longer at a time. It can also mean they have a shorter pause in breathing along with a slow
heart rate
or reduced blood-oxygen level.
Many different medical conditions can cause infant apnea.
Infections
,
metabolic
disorders and
birth defects
(congenital disorders) are just a few examples. If your baby was born preterm, they may develop
apnea of prematurity
. This means the parts of their body that control breathing are still developing and aren’t yet ready to support normal breathing. Providers identify what’s causing your baby’s apnea and recommend treatment.
Periodic breathing is where your baby alternates between short pauses in breathing and several rapid breaths. This is common among babies born preterm or early as well as babies born full-term. Unlike with apnea, providers generally consider periodic breathing normal and not a cause for concern.
When should I call a healthcare provider?
Trust your gut. If your baby’s breathing doesn’t seem right to you, call a healthcare provider. You’ll start to learn what’s normal for your baby as the weeks go on. If something sounds or looks off, don’t hesitate to seek medical care.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Healthcare providers expect newborns to have irregular breathing patterns. But when you’re home with your newborn, it can be hard to tell if what you’re seeing is normal or a cause for concern. In general, your baby is fine if they have just a short pause in breathing (under 10 seconds) and then pick up breathing again on their own. But if you’re ever in any doubt, pick up the phone and call for help.
