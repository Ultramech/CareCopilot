Overview
What is SUTAB
®
bowel preparation?

is a brand name for a medication that contains sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride. It cleans out your
colon
(large intestine) to prepare it for a
colonoscopy
. SUTAB pulls water into your colon to help you poop faster.

Why is bowel prep important?
Bowel prep
completely clears your colon of stool. It’s essential because it gives your
gastroenterologist
the best view of the lining of your colon so they can detect
polyps
or cancer. For your provider, a clean colon is like driving on a clear, sunny day. A dirty colon is like driving in a rainstorm.
If you’re a Cleveland Clinic patient, you must follow the instructions for bowel preparation exactly as prescribed or your colonoscopy will be canceled.
How do I use SUTAB?
SUTAB comes in a kit that contains two medication bottles and a cup for water. Each bottle contains 12 tablets (pills). You’ll take 12 pills (one bottle) with water from the cup the night before your exam. Later that evening, drink two more cups of water. Fill the cup to the line each time. Then, six hours before your exam, repeat all three of those steps.
Be sure to follow all the instructions exactly. If you don’t, your provider may need to cancel or repeat your colonoscopy.
Key preparation instructions
The following instructions are key to a successful colonoscopy:
Your bowel must be empty so that your doctor can clearly view your colon. Follow the instructions you get from your gastroenterologist exactly as they’re written.
Don’t eat any solid food the entire day before your colonoscopy. Drink only clear liquids.
Pick up your prep kit at least five days before your colonoscopy.

Transportation on the day of your colonoscopy
A responsible driver must be with you when you check in before your colonoscopy. They must stay in the waiting area until you’re discharged. You must have someone take you home after your colonoscopy. You can’t drive or leave the facility alone. Avoid operating any sort of vehicle, including a bike, car, scooter and more.

Additional Common Questions
Can I drink extra water with SUTAB?
Yes. In fact, you should stay hydrated by drinking at least 12 8-10-ounce servings of clear liquids in addition to the water you drink with your bowel prep medicine. Just be sure to stop drinking all clear liquids three hours before your colonoscopy.
How long will I poop after taking SUTAB pills?
You should stop pooping a few hours after you start. But everyone’s a little different. For most people who take their SUTAB pills on time, diarrhea stops so that you can get some sleep at night. Maybe you’re nervous that you’ll have to stop on your way from the house to the medical office for your procedure. If you follow the directions, you should have very little left in your bowel when it’s time to start your commute.
What if I have constipation?
You may take extra
laxatives
in the days leading up to your prep. This should help resolve your constipation before your bowel prep day.
What if I’ve had poor prep results in the past?
Contact your physician as you’ll likely need additional bowel prep instructions.

What if I have motility issues from a medical condition?
Certain medical conditions and medications can slow bowel emptying or lead to constipation. Conditions like
Parkinson’s
,
multiple sclerosis
(MS) or using a wheelchair can slow down your digestion. Medications like narcotics, gabapentin and
anticholinergic
medications can also have an impact. Contact your physician and be sure to share your medical history and current medication use, as you’ll likely need extra time and additional laxatives to complete your bowel prep.
What if I can’t drink a large volume of liquid?
Start your prep two to three hours earlier to allow yourself more time to complete the entire prep.
What if I can’t finish my bowel prep?
If you can’t finish your entire bowel prep, you’ll likely need to reschedule your colonoscopy due to poor prep quality.
Do I still have to complete the entire prep if I’ve had bariatric surgery?
Gastric bypass surgery involves your stomach and small bowel. It doesn’t change the length of your colon. You may need to drink smaller amounts of water more slowly. You’ll need to complete the entire bowel prep, it may just take longer.
What if I’m on dialysis?
Please consult your nephrologist prior to scheduling to get instructions that are specific to you. In general, dialysis patients take the
Golytely®
bowel prep and have the procedure on the same day as their dialysis (colonoscopy in a.m., dialysis in p.m.).
How do I know if something is a clear liquid?
If you can pour it in a glass and you can see through it, it’s considered “clear liquid.”

Can I take Uber
®
, Lyft
®
, taxi or bus home?
An adult must be present with you at check-in for your colonoscopy and remain in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged. You can hire a driver to take you home only if this adult escort is with you at check-in, remains in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged and takes the hired ride home with you.
Can I “sleep it off” here and drive myself home?
No, you must have an adult with you when you check in. Your responsible adult must remain in the endoscopy center during your procedure and then drive you home. You can’t drive a vehicle for the rest of the day.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Bowel preparation is an important part of your colonoscopy. Make sure to follow your gastroenterologist’s instructions on how to prepare for your exam. Having a clear colon makes it easier for them to detect polyps and other abnormalities. Ask your healthcare team any questions you have about using SUTAB bowel preparation kit before you begin.
Care at Cleveland Clinic
A colonoscopy or other screening is an important test for colon cancer. The team at Cleveland Clinic can give you peace of mind and expert care when you need it.
