Dysmotility
Dysmotility is a broad term for a variety of conditions that can affect your GI tract. It means you have a problem with the motor functions in your GI tract — the automatic muscle movements that make your digestive system work. Dysmotility can affect any part of your GI tract, from top to bottom. Treatment depends on the cause and your symptoms.

What Is Dysmotility?
Dysmotility is a problem with your
gastrointestinal motility
— the muscle contractions in your GI tract that carry food through the digestive process. These muscles work automatically to keep food and fluids moving in the right direction at the right time. When they don’t work, it can cause a variety of problems with feeding, digestion and elimination (pooping). Dysmotility can affect any part of your GI tract.

Types of dysmotility
GI motility disorders can occur anywhere in your GI tract, including your:
Esophagus
Stomach
Intestines
Anus (butthole)
Esophageal dysmotility
Esophageal dysmotility
can make it hard to swallow or keep food and fluids down. It can lead to food getting stuck on the way down, or food or fluids coming back up.
Some specific esophageal motility disorders include:
Achalasia
Cricopharyngeal spasm
Esophageal spasm
Esophageal stricture
GERD
Rumination syndrome
Stomach dysmotility
When the
muscles in your stomach don’t function normally
, your food may not break down as well as it should. Your stomach may hold onto your food for too long or
release it too soon
into your small intestine.
Some specific gastric motility disorders include:
Cyclic vomiting syndrome
Functional dyspepsia
Dumping syndrome
Gastroparesis
Intestinal dysmotility
Dysmotility can affect your small intestine or large intestine, or both. In your small intestine, it can cause
bacterial overgrowth
and poor digestion. In your large intestine, it can cause constipation or diarrhea.
Some specific intestinal motility disorders include:
Paralytic ileus
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome)
Chronic constipation
Functional diarrhea
Irritable bowel syndrome
Functional bloating

Anal dysmotility
When your anal muscles don’t coordinate well, or they’re too tense, you may have muscle spasms or have
difficulty pooping
. If these muscles are too weak or lack control, you may
poop unintentionally
.
Some specific anal motility disorders include:
Anismus (dyssynergic defecation)
Hirschsprung’s disease
Levator ani syndrome
Fecal incontinence
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of dysmotility
Dysmotility in your GI tract may cause:
Difficulty swallowing
Backwash or regurgitation
Indigestion or heartburn
Fullness and bloating
Nausea and vomiting
Constipation
Diarrhea
Difficulty pooping
Difficulty holding in poop
Dysmotility causes
The muscles in your GI tract move in response to signals from your nervous system. Dysmotility can happen if there’s a problem with the muscles themselves (
myopathy
) or a problem with the nerve signals that activate them (
neuropathy
). Injuries and surgeries can cause muscle damage or nerve damage, resulting in dysmotility. Diseases that affect your muscles or nervous system can, too.
Some causes include:
Neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis)
Nervous system injury (like a head injury, brainstem injury, spinal cord injury or nerve injury)
Diabetes (diabetes-related neuropathy also increases your risk of neurodegenerative disease)
Post-infectious syndromes (when bacterial or viral infections damage nerve or muscle function)
Autoimmune diseases (like systemic sclerosis, lupus, esophagitis or inflammatory bowel disease)
Surgery on your GI tract (like gastrectomy, bowel resection or Nissen fundoplication)
Visceral hypersensitivity (excessively excited neurons in your GI tract)
Complications of dysmotility
GI motility disorders can cause difficulties with feeding or with digesting and absorbing nutrients from your food. This can lead to complications like malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances. Dysmotility in the lower part of your GI tract can cause various difficulties with pooping. Severe constipation can lead to complications like toxic megacolon. Dysmotility can also significantly affect your quality of life.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose dysmotility
Diagnosing dysmotility is a process. Your provider will ask you about your symptoms and health history. Then, they’ll check to see if anything is physically blocking movement in your GI tract. Once they’ve ruled that out, they’ll try to observe how your GI tract moves. This might involve tests, like:
Fluoroscopic GI X-ray exams
Cine MRI
Esophageal manometry test
Gastric emptying study
Wireless motility study
Capsule endoscopy
Anorectal manometry test
Esophageal pH and impedance test
Electrogastrography
You may need additional tests to help diagnose a specific motility disorder — like a blood test or biopsy.
Management and Treatment
How is dysmotility treated?
Most GI motility disorders aren’t curable, so treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms and addressing complications. This may involve medications, lifestyle changes and, sometimes, surgery.

Your provider may offer advice about foods to eat or avoid and dietary supplements to take. If you have serious malnutrition, they might suggest you get extra nutrition through a tube or
through an IV
.
They might suggest medications like:
Proton pump inhibitors (for acid reflux)
Prokinetics (to speed up intestinal transit)
Antispasmodics (to relieve cramping)
Neuropathic pain medications
Laxatives (for constipation)
Bulking agents (for diarrhea)
Antibiotics (for bacterial overgrowth)
Immunosuppressants (for autoimmune disorders)
Antidiarrheals (for diarrhea)
If you don’t improve with medications, they might suggest procedures, like:
Botox® injection
Esophageal dilation
Fundoplication
Myotomy (muscle incision)
Pyloroplasty
Functional electrical stimulation
Ostomy
Antegrade enema
Behavioral medicine
Alternative medicine (like acupuncture)

Outlook / Prognosis
What should I expect if I have GI dysmotility?
Dysmotility affects each person differently. Your symptoms may be minor or major. Sometimes, small changes make big improvements. In other cases, you might need to adjust your life around time-consuming treatments or have surgery before you find relief. One thing’s for sure: Your GI motility is crucial to your health. Your provider won’t stop until they find the treatment that works for you.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s normal to experience occasional changes in how your GI tract moves. Things like what you eat, medications and lifestyle factors can cause temporary reflux, constipation or diarrhea. But sometimes, there’s something deeper going on. When dysmotility comes from a mechanical failure in your body, you might need medical treatment for it. Don’t ignore symptoms of dysmotility that don’t go away.
