Overview
What is copper deficiency?
Copper deficiency is a rare nutritional deficiency that happens when you don’t get enough copper from food, or your body can’t use the mineral like it should. You can develop the condition, but some people are born with a disorder that affects how their bodies process copper (
Menkes disease
).

Copper
is more than the metal that makes pennies or jewelry. You have copper throughout your body. There’s copper in enzymes that are important building blocks and support your
immune system
. It also helps build your red blood cells and bones. When you don’t have enough copper, you may have symptoms like fatigue, trouble walking or tingling sensations in your hands and feet. Healthcare providers treat the condition with copper supplements.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of copper deficiency?
Symptoms vary depending on the cause. If you develop copper deficiency, your symptoms may include:
Broken vertebrae (
compression fractures
)
Fatigue
Frequent infections
Numbness or tingling in your hands and feet
Pallor
(skin paleness)
Developing gray hair at a younger age
What causes copper deficiency?
Several things may cause copper deficiency.
Malabsorption syndrome
: These are conditions that affect your body’s ability to absorb nutrients from your food. Examples are inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease or autoimmune diseases like celiac disease. You can develop malabsorption after bariatric surgery.
Macronutrient undernutrition
: This is the medical term for what happens when the food you eat doesn’t meet your body’s needs for vitamins and minerals, including copper. It’s a type of malnutrition.
Total
parenteral nutrition
: Parenteral nutrition is how you receive nutrients when surgery or illness means you can’t use your digestive system to process food. You may need total parenteral nutrition after surgeries like a bowel resection or gastrectomy.
Zinc overload
: Taking large amounts of zinc supplements or using denture adhesives that contain zinc can affect your body’s ability to absorb copper.

What are the complications of copper deficiency?
Complications may include:
Anemia
High levels of cholesterol in your blood (hyperlipidemia)
Osteoporosis
Peripheral neuropathy
Neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell)
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose copper deficiency?
A healthcare provider will do a physical examination. They’ll ask about your medical history. This may include if you’ve had bariatric surgery, an inflammatory bowel disorder or an autoimmune disease that may lead to copper deficiency. They might ask if you take zinc supplements. They may order the following blood tests:
Ceruloplasmin test
: This is a protein that helps copper move through your body. Low ceruloplasmin levels are signs your body isn’t using copper efficiently.
Complete blood count (CBC)
and vitamin B12 tests
: Copper deficiency and
vitamin B12 deficiency
cause similar symptoms. A provider may want to order these tests to rule out that condition.
Management and Treatment
How is copper deficiency treated?
Healthcare providers prescribe copper supplements to boost the amount of copper in your body. The exact amount will vary depending on your overall health and your symptoms. In general, however, providers prescribe 2 milligrams of copper supplement. That’s about double the amount of copper that you’d get from food.
How long do I need to take copper supplements?
There’s no set time, and your treatment time will depend on your symptoms. For example, one
study
of a case of copper deficiency showed that taking copper supplements for about six weeks cured anemia that was causing fatigue. If you have a copper deficiency, your healthcare provider will explain what you can expect.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have copper deficiency?
If tests show you have a copper deficiency, taking supplements as prescribed by your healthcare provider should increase the amount of copper in your body and eliminate your symptoms. But some of your symptoms may go away faster than others. So, ask your healthcare provider what you can expect.
Prevention
Can copper deficiency be prevented?
If your overall health is good, adding certain foods to your meals will prevent copper deficiency. Adults need about 900 micrograms (mcg) daily. Some copper-rich foods include pan-fried beef liver, baking chocolate and unpeeled potatoes.

How do I take care of myself?
You should add copper-rich food to your menu and take supplements as directed. But remember — a little copper goes a long way. The upper limit for copper from all sources is 10,000 mcg daily. Taking in more than that can lead to copper toxicity that may damage your liver.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you’re receiving treatment for copper deficiency, contact your provider if your symptoms don’t seem to be getting better. There may be another reason why you’re not feeling well despite increasing the amount of copper in your system.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Copper deficiency is rare, so you may want to know more about it. Here are some questions you may want to ask:
Why do I have a copper deficiency?
How long will I need to take copper supplements?
When will my symptoms go away?
What happens if my symptoms get worse?

Additional Common Questions
What’s the best way to help my body absorb copper?
Studies show your digestive system absorbs more copper from animal protein like beef liver or turkey giblets than other types of protein like tofu or salmon. Your healthcare provider or a dietitian may have more suggestions.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Copper is one of the many trace minerals that keep your body working like it should. Copper does a lot: It supports your immune system, builds strong bones and helps build red blood cells. That’s why copper deficiency could lead to diseases like anemia.
Copper deficiency symptoms include fatigue — feeling exhausted no matter how much rest you get — and a pins-and-needles feeling in your hands and feet. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have these symptoms. Copper deficiency may be the reason, or you may have another issue. Either way, it’s a good idea to get a diagnosis sooner rather than later.
