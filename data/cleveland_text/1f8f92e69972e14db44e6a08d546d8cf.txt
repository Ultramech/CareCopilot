Sexually Transmitted Fungal Infection (TMVII)
Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII) is a sexually transmitted fungal infection. That means it mainly spreads through anal, vaginal or oral sex. It causes rashes around your penis or vulva, butt, face or legs. The rash can be itchy or painful. Providers treat it with antifungal medications.

Overview
Sexually transmitted fungal infection rashes are most common on your penis or vulva, butt and face.
What is a sexually transmitted fungal infection?
A sexually transmitted fungal infection is a skin rash that spreads mainly through oral, anal or vaginal sex. The fungus
Trichophyton mentagrophytes
type VII (TMVII) causes it. It forms itchy, painful patches of skin around your penis or vulva (genitals), butt, face or legs.

Policy
TMVII is the only known sexually transmitted
fungal infection
. Other fungal infections, like
jock itch
and
yeast infections
, can sometimes spread through sex, but they’re not considered
sexually transmitted infections
(STIs). The rash caused by TMVII is often more severe than other kinds of fungal infections in your skin.
Trichophyton mentagrophytes
infections around your genitals are also called tinea genitalis.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted fungal infections?
The main symptom of sexually transmitted fungal infections is a
rash
. The rash might be:
On your penis,
vulva
, butt, butthole (anus), legs or face
Ring-shaped, with a slightly raised edge or a darker or different shade around the edge
Red, pink or purple
Darker or
discolored
compared to the skin around it
Itchy
Painful
Blistered
Scaly
What causes sexually transmitted fungal infections?
The fungus
Trichophyton mentagrophytes
genotype VII (TMVII) causes sexually transmitted fungal infections. It’s a type of
ringworm
.
How is TMVII transmitted?
TMVII spreads between people by touching the rash. It can spread through sex or by sharing personal items, like towels or sex toys.
What are the risk factors for a TMVII infection?
Anyone who’s been in contact with TMVII can get infected. But men who have sex with men and people who exchange sex for money are at a higher risk.
What are the complications of sexually transmitted fungal infections?
TMVII can sometimes lead to secondary
bacterial infections
(bacterial infections that happen at the same site as the fungal infection) that require treatment at a hospital. The rash can also cause scarring.

Diagnosis and Tests
How are sexually transmitted fungal infections diagnosed?
Your provider might think you have a fungal infection based on the appearance of the rash. If it doesn’t go away with topical antifungals (creams or lotions), they may suspect it’s TMVII (topical antifungals don’t work on TMVII).
A provider diagnoses TMVII by scraping a sample of skin from the rash and testing it. A lab will look for
Trichophyton mentagrophytes
under a microscope. They might try to grow (culture) fungi from the sample. These tests can sometimes take a few weeks, so your provider may start treatment before the results are back.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat
Trichophyton mentagrophytes
?
Treatment for TMVII is
antifungal medications
you take by mouth, like terbinafine or
itraconazole
. Antifungal creams or lotions don’t work on TMVII fungal infections.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have TMVII?
If you have a sexually transmitted fungal infection, it might take a while to feel better. You’ll have to take antifungal medication for anywhere from two weeks to a few months. During this time:
Don’t use steroid creams or lotions on the rash — this can make it worse
Wash and dry your clothes, bedding and towels on high heat to kill fungus spores
Avoid sex and other physical activities that could spread the fungus
Let recent sex partners know that they might be infected — they can talk to their providers about getting tested
Prevention
Can TMVII be prevented?
You can reduce your risk of getting and spreading sexually transmitted fungal infections by:
Not having sex if you or your partner have a fungal infection or rash
Not sharing personal items, like bedding or towels
Avoiding contact with rashes
Wearing internal or external
condoms
or
dental dams
during any kind of sex — but keep in mind that the fungus can still spread if it’s not completely covered
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your provider if you have a persistent or painful rash. If a provider has prescribed an antifungal cream or lotion and the rash hasn’t gone away, let your provider know.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room if you have a high fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius) or a rash or wound that is:
Not healing
Getting larger or spreading to other parts of your body
Warm to the touch
Very painful
Oozing pus
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask your provider:
How do I avoid spreading the infection?
How do I take care of the rash/sores?
When should I follow up with you?
How do I take this medication?
For how long do I need to take this medication?
Are there any severe symptoms I should look out for?
When is it safe to have sex again?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Sexually transmitted fungal infections aren’t as simple to treat as other fungal rashes, like jock itch. A cream won’t make TMVII go away — but it can be cured with prescription antifungal medications. You’ll have to take them for several weeks to feel better. Don’t hesitate to ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns.
