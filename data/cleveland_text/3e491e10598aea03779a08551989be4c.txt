Plasma Cell Leukemia
Plasma cell leukemia is a rare, aggressive type of multiple myeloma. Treatments include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy and stem cell transplants for those who qualify. Treatment can manage symptoms and prolong your life, but it usually doesn’t cure the cancer.

Overview
What is plasma cell leukemia?
Plasma cell leukemia is an aggressive type of
multiple myeloma
. It happens when abnormal plasma cells circulate in your bloodstream. This differs from typical multiple myeloma, in which the abnormal plasma cells stay in your
bone marrow
.

Plasma cell leukemia is most common in
men
between the ages of 55 and 65. It’s also more common among people who are Black. But overall, the condition is rare. In fact, it’s the rarest form of multiple myeloma, making up about
2% to 3%
of all plasma cell cancers.
Treatment can slow the cancer, relieve symptoms and prolong life, but typically doesn’t
cure
it. New treatments can prolong the lives of people with plasma cell leukemia, but there’s still much work to do.
Types of plasma cell leukemia
There are two types of plasma cell leukemia:
Primary
: Plasma cell leukemia without a history of multiple myeloma. This means that abnormal cells are already circulating in your bloodstream at the time of diagnosis. Primary PCL affects about
1 person out of every 1 million people
in the general population and makes up about 60% of all plasma cell leukemia cases.
Secondary
: Plasma cell leukemia with a history of multiple myeloma. This is when you already have multiple myeloma, but it gets worse. According to research, 0.5% to 4% of multiple myeloma cases turn into secondary PCL. Secondary PCL leukemia affects up to
4 in 100 people
with multiple myeloma and makes up about 40% of all plasma cell leukemia cases.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of plasma cell leukemia?
Plasma cell leukemia symptoms vary for each person. But they may include:

Anemia
.
Bleeding easily.
Bone pain
.
Bone fracture
Fatigue
.
High calcium levels in your blood (
hypercalcemia
).
Infections that linger or come back frequently.
Kidney
damage.
What causes plasma cell leukemia?
Acquired
genetic changes
during plasma cell development cause plasma cell leukemia. But researchers aren’t sure why these changes take place to begin with.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is plasma cell leukemia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will need to measure the number of abnormal
plasma
cells in your
blood
. To do this, they’ll need to do a
blood test
. If you have plasma cell leukemia, abnormal cells will make up over 5% of your total
white blood cells
.
Your provider will also do a
bone marrow biopsy
to measure the number of abnormal plasma cells in your bone marrow. They’ll also use imaging tests like
CT scans
(computed tomography scan) or
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) to check for bone damage that can result from these cells.
Management and Treatment
How is plasma cell leukemia treated?
Healthcare providers treat plasma cell leukemia on a case-by-case basis. They might recommend one type of treatment or a combination.
Plasma cell leukemia treatments include the same ones that are used in multiple myeloma:
Autologous stem cell transplant
. Providers usually do this type of
stem cell transplant
after chemotherapy if you’re eligible.
Chemotherapy
. This may include
chemotherapy drugs
like doxorubicin (Adriamycin
®
),
cisplatin
and
cyclophosphamide
(Cytoxan
®
).
Immunotherapy
. This treatment includes monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab (Darzalex®), bispecific antibodies like teclistamab (Tecvayli®) and
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy
.
Targeted therapy
. This treatment includes proteasome inhibitors like
bortezomib
(Velcade
®
),
carfilzomib
(Kyprolis
®
) and
ixazomib
(Ninlaro
®
) as well as immunomodulators like lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and pomalidomide (Pomalyst
®
).
Your healthcare provider may also recommend
palliative care
to ease your symptoms and support you through your journey.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for plasma cell leukemia?
Plasma cell leukemia is an aggressive disease and is often
fatal
. Less than 10% of people with this type of cancer live longer than five years after their diagnoss. People with primary plasma cell leukemia usually live longer compared to those with secondary plasma cell leukemia.
Life expectancy varies depending on the severity of disease, what type of treatment you receive and how your body responds to that treatment.
Those who qualify for a stem cell transplant may live three to four years on average. But some people may live longer.
One research study
reported a case of plasma cell leukemia that had been in
remission
for nine years before relapsing.
People with this condition are living slightly longer today than they were a couple of decades ago. While it’s progress, it’s only a small improvement. But researchers continue to follow that thread.
Prevention
Can plasma cell leukemia be prevented?
You can’t prevent plasma cell leukemia because you can’t control the genetic changes that cause it. This condition is difficult to study because it’s so rare. But researchers continue to look for ways to detect it earlier.

How do I take care of myself?
Having plasma cell leukemia can make your future seem uncertain. And you’ll likely experience a flood of different emotions like fear, anger, sadness, frustration or guilt. Remember there’s no right or wrong way to feel. It’s important to process your feelings. Talk to someone you trust or ask your healthcare provider for resources. They can help you maintain your quality of life after diagnosis and during treatment.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You’ll stay in close contact with your healthcare provider throughout your treatment. But you should let them know if you experience new or worsening symptoms.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you have plasma cell leukemia, you’ll probably have lots of questions for your healthcare provider. Here are some things you might want to ask:
How advanced is the cancer?
What are my treatment options?
Am I eligible for a stem cell transplant?
How long can I live with treatment?
What resources should I take advantage of?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Having any kind of cancer is life-altering. But when it’s something as rare and aggressive as plasma cell leukemia, it can feel especially isolating. It might seem like no one understands what you’re going through. Consider joining a support group so you can meet others who are going through similar experiences. Lean on your loved ones and your healthcare team. They’re here to help ensure and maintain your quality of life after you get a diagnosis and during treatment. You don’t have to go through this alone.
