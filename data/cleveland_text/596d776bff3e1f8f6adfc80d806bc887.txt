Night Terrors
Night terrors are sleep disturbances where you partially wake up and experience fear and panic symptoms. You might scream, get out of bed or move around violently. Many people go back to sleep as soon as the episode is over. In the morning, you won’t remember what happened. A healthcare provider can help you manage night terrors.

Overview
What are night terrors?
Night terrors (sleep terrors) happen when your brain is partially asleep and partially awake. It causes a state of panic or fear. You or your child may sit up or jump out of bed, cry, scream, start sweating and feel your heart beat fast. Night terrors usually last between one and 30 minutes, and you’ll fall back to sleep when they’re over.

It can be difficult for parents, caregivers or sleeping partners to calm you down during a night terror. In the morning, you won’t remember what happened.
Night terrors are a type of
parasomnia
. These are a group of
sleep disorders
that affect sleep movements and behavior. They happen during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage of sleep, usually in the first part of the night.
Night terrors in children
Children are more at risk of night terrors, especially between ages 3 through 7. Most often, children grow out of night terrors when they reach adolescence or adulthood. Children may look dazed with their eyes open or sometimes closed. Children aren’t easily consoled or responsive to simple conversations during an episode and may become more upset if you try to calm them down. They may have partial awake behaviors such as kicking, mumbling or unclear speech. Kids who have sleep terrors are more likely to sleepwalk later in life,
wet the bed
and they likely won’t remember what happened in the morning.
Night terrors in adults
Night terrors are less common among adults. Adults may be more injury-prone than children, as many people suddenly get out of bed when one happens. Night terrors in adults usually point to an underlying
mental health condition
, like
post-traumatic stress disorder
or
anxiety disorder
.

What causes night terrors?
The cause of night terrors is unknown. Research suggests night terrors happen when your consciousness is stuck between deep stages of sleep and wakefulness. You’re not fully awake as a night terror happens. That’s why it’s hard for someone else to comfort or wake you up.
What triggers night terrors?
Night terrors may trigger (happen) after or because of the following:
Having a
fever
.
Sleep deprivation
.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Feeling
stress
or anxiety.
Emotional tension.
Drinking alcohol.
What are the risk factors for night terrors?

You may also be more at risk of night terrors if you have another underlying sleep disorder, like
obstructive sleep apnea
or
periodic limb movement disorder
.
What are the complications of night terrors?
Night terrors may or may not interrupt your child’s sleep and affect the quality of sleep you get each night.
Night terrors could also lead to physical injury. They usually involve thrashing (moving around violently). Children and adults may fall out of bed or smack their arms and legs on nearby bedroom furniture. It’s common to wake up with
bruises
after a night terror. Some injuries are more serious and require immediate medical attention.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are night terrors diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose night terrors after a detailed history and a
physical exam
to learn more about you or your symptoms or gather observations from a parent or sleeping partner. Treatment isn’t necessary if you only have infrequent episodes, like a few night terrors a year. But you should see a healthcare provider if they happen frequently, like a few times each week.
You won’t usually need additional testing. But your provider may offer tests like an
electroencephalogram
(EEG) or overnight sleep study (
polysomnography
) to rule out conditions with similar symptoms or triggers like obstructive sleep apnea.
Management and Treatment
How do I stop night terrors?
There isn’t a specific treatment that stops night terrors for everyone.
The first line of treatment is to ensure the safety of someone who has a night terror and then let the episode run its course. The person experiencing the night terror might not remember what happened. Offering support the next day can help someone better understand what’s going on. It’s also important to address common triggers such as a lack of sleep, obstructive sleep apnea or fever, as that can reduce the frequency of episodes.

A healthcare provider may recommend strategies to reduce stress, like talking to a mental health professional. Your emotional health can impact how well you sleep at night.
Medications for night terrors
Healthcare providers don’t recommend medications as a treatment for night terrors. If you need medications, your provider will offer them only in very frequent injury prone episodes after treating triggers. Medications treat underlying conditions, especially anxiety disorders, for example.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have night terrors?
Night terrors are disruptive, not only to you but also to others within your household. They’re alarming for parents, caregivers and sleeping partners, as it can be difficult to comfort someone who’s experiencing one.
Night terrors usually don’t last forever. Many children may outgrow night terrors before they reach high school. Some night terrors happen with underlying conditions, so managing those can reduce how often night terrors happen.
If night terrors are frequent and you’re not getting quality sleep each night, let a healthcare provider know.
Prevention
How can I prevent night terrors?
A healthcare provider may recommend strategies to improve your
sleep hygiene
. This will help you get the amount and quality of sleep you need. It may reduce how often night terrors affect you. These include:

Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeine before bedtime.
Eliminate sleep disruptions like bright lights or loud noises.
Manage any underlying sleep disorders like sleep apnea, for example.
Move furniture (like nightstands) or potentially dangerous objects away from your bed to improve nighttime safety.

Should I try to wake someone up if they have night terrors?
Experts don’t recommend waking up someone who’s having a night terror. Your first reaction might be to hold down or stop someone from thrashing or moving during an episode. This can be dangerous for both you and the person experiencing a night terror, as their brain is in deep sleep and may not wake up easily. In fact, attempting to wake up someone may prolong a sleep terror episode.
You can help someone during a night terror by gently guiding them back to bed (if they’re out of bed) and speaking to them slowly, quietly and calmly. This will help them get back to sleep when the episode is over. You should also stay with the person experiencing an episode to make sure they’re safe until they fall back to sleep.
When should I see a healthcare provider?
Talk to a healthcare provider about night terrors if:
They happen often (a few times per week).
You or your child aren’t getting quality sleep.
You or your child experience injuries after a night terror.
If episodes happen frequently each night, particularly in the second half of the night.
Episodes are shorter than one minute.
Symptoms of other conditions, such as snoring, mouth breathing and excessive daytime sleepiness.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your mind probably goes to the worst possible scenario if you hear someone scream and move around violently in the middle of the night. You might feel like there’s nothing you can do to help calm them down. On the other side, you might wake up to someone telling you that you had symptoms of a night terror. But you don’t remember any of it.
Exactly as the name says, night terrors are terrifying for everyone involved. Symptoms prevent you, and those within your household, from getting a good night’s rest.
If night terrors are frequent, talk to a healthcare provider. They can help you narrow down a cause, avoid triggers and/or manage any underlying conditions.
