Post-Traumatic Arthritis
Post-traumatic arthritis develops after a traumatic injury to your joint. It causes inflammation, swelling and pain. It’s usually temporary and easy to treat at home. Many treatments are the same as those you’d already be using to treat your injury.

What Is Post-Traumatic Arthritis?
Post-traumatic arthritis affects a previously injured joint, causing arthritis symptoms like pain and swelling.
Post-traumatic arthritis is inflammation in a
joint
that develops after a
traumatic injury
to it. It’s a degenerative type of
arthritis
, which means it’s from wear and tear on the joint. Usually, degenerative arthritis (
osteoarthritis
) takes a long time to develop. But when you have an injury, wear and tear on your joint adds up faster. Post-traumatic arthritis develops in weeks or months rather than years.

Fortunately, this sort of damage usually isn’t permanent, and post-traumatic arthritis is usually a temporary issue. Most people recover in a few months with home care. But some injuries can do more damage than others, and sometimes, post-traumatic arthritis becomes a long-term (chronic) condition. Though it’s rare, you might need surgery if your symptoms are severe and limit your quality of life.
Other terms for post-traumatic arthritis include:
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis
Post-traumatic arthropathy
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of post-traumatic arthritis
Post-traumatic arthritis causes
inflammation
in your injured joint. Symptoms can include:
Joint pain
Joint swelling
Limited range of motion in your joint
Difficulty bearing weight on your joint
The joints most often affected by post-traumatic arthritis include your:
Ankle joint
Knee joint
Hip joint
Elbow joint
In severe cases, pieces of
cartilage
can break off and get stuck in your joint. This may cause:
A crackling or crunching sound when you move your joint
A feeling like something is catching in your joint when it moves
Complications of post-traumatic arthritis
Sometimes, severe post-traumatic arthritis doesn’t heal as expected. When it lasts more than six months, it’s considered a chronic condition. At this point, it becomes something else. Some scientists consider it to be the start of chronic osteoarthritis. This is a progressive condition, which means your joint continues to degenerate. Some also believe that it can trigger the start of inflammatory arthritis.

Post-traumatic arthritis causes
Traumatic injuries that impact your joints can cause post-traumatic arthritis. Common causes include:
Car accidents
Sports injuries
Falls
Injuries that move or damage the bones in your joint can also damage the cartilage that surrounds them, leading to arthritis. Common types of injuries that can affect your bones and cartilage include:
Fractures
Dislocations
Sprains
Risk factors for post-traumatic arthritis
Unlike most types of arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis is more common in younger people, including kids. It’s also more common in athletes and other active adults, who tend to get injured more often.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is post-traumatic arthritis diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will diagnose post-traumatic arthritis with a physical exam and imaging tests. Your provider will move your joint, ask you about your symptoms and compare your joint and its range of motion (how far you can move that part of your body) to what it was before your injury — if possible. After your physical exam, you might need at least one of the following imaging tests of your joint:
X-ray
MRI
CT scan
Management and Treatment
Post-traumatic arthritis treatment
Most people can treat post-traumatic arthritis at home. Treatment may include:
Pain relievers
. Your healthcare provider can recommend appropriate medications for you.
Wearing a
brace
.
Wearing a brace around your joint can help hold it in place while it heals.
Physical therapy
.
A
physical therapist
can show you exercises to help restore your joint.
Weight loss
.
In some cases, taking excess weight off your joint can relieve pain and help it heal.
In rare circumstances, when your symptoms are severe and don’t seem to be improving, your healthcare provider might recommend surgery for post-traumatic arthritis. Surgical procedures might include:
Arthroscopy
. You might only need
minimally invasive surgery
to fix a small problem, like removing damaged tissues or loose pieces of cartilage from your joint.
Joint fusion (arthrodesis)
.
This surgery fuses the bones in your joint together to prevent it from causing pain when it moves.
Joint replacement (arthroplasty)
.
Your surgeon will replace your damaged joint with an artificial joint (a
prosthesis
) made of metal, ceramic or plastic.
When should I seek emergency care?
Go to the emergency room if:
You have intense or worsening pain
You can’t move a part of your body that you normally can
Your body part looks deformed or out of place
New bruising appears with any of these other symptoms

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for post-traumatic arthritis?
Most people have post-traumatic arthritis for only a few months. Your arthritis will typically improve as your body recovers from your trauma. But in rare, severe cases, you may continue to experience symptoms for longer than six months. This is called chronic post-traumatic arthritis. When it’s chronic, it may be lifelong. Your healthcare provider will help you to manage your condition in the long term.

Prevention
How can I reduce my risk for post-traumatic arthritis?
Follow these general safety tips to reduce your risk of an injury:
Always wear your seatbelt.
Wear protective equipment for all activities and sports.
Make sure your home and workspace are free of clutter that could trip you or others.
Use a stool when you need to reach things. Don’t stand on chairs, tables or countertops.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
When you’ve already had a traumatic injury, post-traumatic arthritis is an extra insult. It can be frustrating to develop a new complication while you’re recovering. But post-traumatic arthritis is usually temporary and easy to treat at home while you’re treating your injury. It doesn’t do permanent damage to your joints. In the rare event that it’s more severe and longer-lasting, surgery can treat it if necessary.
