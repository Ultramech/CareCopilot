Encephalitis
Encephalitis is brain inflammation (swelling). Causes include viral infections, infections from insect bites or an autoimmune reaction that affects your brain. It can be life-threatening or cause long-term complications. Treatment varies, but most people require hospitalization so they can receive intensive treatment, including life support.

Overview
What is encephalitis?
Encephalitis is a rare, serious condition that causes
inflammation
in your
brain
so that it swells. It can occur as a result of an infection or an autoimmune process. Encephalitis can be life-threatening, regardless of the cause, and can cause long-term complications and medical issues. Treatment varies depending on the cause, but most people with encephalitis require hospitalization so they can receive intensive treatment, including
life support measures

Types of encephalitis
Condition types include infective encephalitis and
autoimmune encephalitis
. Infective encephalitis includes:
Viral encephalitis
: This is the most common form of encephalitis. You can develop viral encephalitis after having certain infectious diseases or viruses.
Arbovirus encephalitis
: Mosquitos, fleas and ticks can spread infections that can become encephalitis.
Bacterial or fungal encephalitis
: Encephalitis from
bacterial
or
fungal infections
is the least common type of the condition.
In autoimmune encephalitis, your
immune system
mistakenly attacks your brain, causing inflammation that may affect how your brain works. This sometimes happens to people with cancer. Healthcare providers call this
paraneoplastic syndrome
.
Symptoms and Causes
Encephalitis symptoms vary depending on the cause. Viral encephalitis symptoms develop quickly. Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms and may be life-threatening.
What are encephalitis symptoms?
Symptoms vary depending on the type of encephalitis. Encephalitis from infections typically develop more quickly than autoimmune encephalitis. Early warning signs of infective encephalitis include:
Confusion
.
Drowsiness.
Fatigue
.
Headache
.
High
fever
.
Loss of consciousness.
Mild to moderate
neck stiffness
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Seizure
.
Autoimmune encephalitis develops more slowly. It can cause some of the same symptoms as infective encephalitis. But it also causes neurological symptoms like:
Advertisement
Memory issues
.
Noticeable personality changes, like being very angry for no reason.
Speech issues.
Weakness or loss of movement in some parts of your body.
Infective and autoimmune encephalitis may be life-threatening. CALL 911 IF YOU HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS OR ARE WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS THESE SYMPTOMS.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is encephalitis diagnosed?
Healthcare providers will do a physical examination. They’ll ask about your symptoms, including how long you’ve had them. They may do the following tests:
Blood tests
, including complete blood count (
CBC
) and comprehensive metabolic panel (
CMP
).
Imaging tests, including computed tomography (
CT
) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (
MRI
) scans and magnetoencephalography (
MEG
).
Lumbar puncture
.
Neurological examination
.
Management and Treatment
What are treatments for encephalitis?
Healthcare providers treat the condition’s underlying cause and symptoms. Most people with encephalitis are treated in the hospital so providers can monitor their symptoms and move quickly if symptoms get worse. Treatments include:
Antiseizure medication
:
Treatment to manage seizures that autoimmune encephalitis can cause.
Antiviral medications
: Providers often treat all viral encephalitis with
acyclovir
(Zovirax®).
Breathing assistance:
People with severe encephalitis may need supplemental oxygen or support from a ventilator (
mechanical ventilation
).
Corticosteroids
:
Both viral and autoimmune encephalitis cause brain inflammation or swelling that puts pressure on your brain. Steroids help to reduce swelling and brain pressure
Enteral nutrition
:
Severe encephalitis may cause unconsciousness. Enteral nutrition (tube feeding) supports nutrition when you aren’t conscious.
Immune globulin
:
This medication treats autoimmune encephalitis
.
Intravenous (IV) fluids
:
This is supportive care to prevent dehydration.
Mental health support:
Encephalitis may cause memory issues and personality changes. Working with a clinical
psychologist
may help.
Physical therapy:
The condition may affect balance. Physical therapy may help you develop coping strategies.
Plasmapheresis
:
This is autoimmune encephalitis treatment
.
Speech therapy
: Encephalitis may cause neurological issues that affect speech.

Outlook / Prognosis
How long does it take to recover from encephalitis?
You may have encephalitis symptoms for a few days up to two or three months. It can take an additional two or three months to completely recover from the condition.
Can encephalitis be cured?
Medication to treat underlying conditions, like viruses, may cure encephalitis. In some cases, however, encephalitis may cause long-term issues that require ongoing medical care. For example, people may have ongoing issues with behavior, memory loss or speech.
What is the life expectancy for someone with encephalitis?
That depends on their situation. While most people with encephalitis recover, the condition can be life-threatening. One study showed 5% of people died while in the hospital for encephalitis treatment. In general, how long you live after recovering from encephalitis depends on factors like:
The underlying cause
: Common viruses like herpes simplex tend to cause less serious issues and, as a result, don’t have a significant impact on life expectancy.
The level of inflammation
: Severe inflammation that causes neurological issues can affect life expectancy.
Age and overall health
: Children have a better chance of recovery than older adults. Recovery is more challenging for people with preexisting health issues or weakened immune systems.
Early diagnosis and treatment
: People who receive prompt treatment tend to have better outcomes, including less of a chance that this condition will have an impact on their life expectancy.

If you have encephalitis or care for someone who does, ask a healthcare provider what to expect.
Prevention
Can infective encephalitis be prevented?
Viral infections and viruses carried by insects are common encephalitis causes. You can reduce your risk by keeping vaccinations up to date. Ask your provider which ones they recommend. You can also protect yourself from
mosquito bites
by:
Wearing protective clothes:
Add lightweight long-sleeve shirts and pants to your summer wardrobe. Add a hat to protect your ears
.
Using insect repellents:
Pick repellents containing
DEET
, and be sure to follow instructions on the repellent packaging.
Keeping your property dry:
Mosquitos lay their eggs in standing water, like water in flowerpots or open garbage cans. Dry out items and then spray them with insecticide.
Using screens and fans:
Window screens help to keep mosquitos outside. But if they’re inside, running fans will keep mosquitos moving and less likely to land on you.
Living With
How do I take care of myself?
It takes time for your brain to heal from encephalitis, so recovery is more of a marathon than a sprint. Here are some suggestions that may help you along the road to recovery:
Pace yourself:
You may feel very tired for months after you get over encephalitis. You may need to take a break from some commitments so you can focus on high-priority activities like your family life without becoming exhausted.
Get your rest:
Develop
good sleep hygiene
habits like setting regular bedtimes and cutting back on stimulants like caffeine and alcohol.
Maintain a healthy diet
: Focus on lean protein, whole grains, leafy vegetables and fruits. The
Mediterranean diet
may be an option.
Develop an exercise routine
: Regular exercise can help you to deal with the challenges of a long recovery from encephalitis.
Share your situation
: You may look perfectly healthy even though you’re still recovering. Let your friends and family know why you’re taking life slow.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have encephalitis, ask your provider about changes that may mean your condition is getting worse. And go to the emergency room anytime you have symptoms like confusion, noticeable personality changes, speech issues or weakness, or you can’t move your arms or legs.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Encephalitis is a serious disease that can have long-term consequences. It can take months or years for you to fully recover from the condition. Unlike injuries or illnesses that affect your body, you can’t see or feel your brain beginning to heal. People may assume you’re completely recovered when you’re still working through issues, from ongoing fatigue to neurological challenges. If that’s your situation, take time to explain how encephalitis continues to affect you.
