Candidiasis
Candidiasis is a yeast infection that occurs when a type of yeast called Candida albicans grows out of control. It commonly affects your mouth, skin and vagina. Candidiasis isn’t a serious infection, but you still want to seek treatment right away. Antifungal medications can effectively treat and clear up the infection within two days to two weeks.

What Is Candidiasis?
Candidiasis is a
fungal infection
caused by an overgrowth of a type of yeast that lives on your body called
Candida
albicans
. A candidiasis infection often appears where
Candida
naturally lives in small amounts, like your skin, mouth or vagina.

Normally, healthy
bacteria
on your body prevent yeast overgrowth. Imagine you have a two-armed scale with healthy bacteria on one side and yeast on the other. The scale stays balanced until something disrupts it, like:
Certain medical conditions
Stress
Unhealthy eating patterns
Weakened
immune system
When something disrupts your scale, a candidiasis infection can occur.
Candidiasis causes discomfort, itching and irritation until you find treatment, but it isn’t a major threat to your overall health. Like any other infection, you should treat it right away to relieve your symptoms. Left untreated, severe infections could spread to other parts of your body, including your
blood
,
heart
and
brain
.
Types of candidiasis
Since yeast naturally lives on your body, there are different types of candidiasis based on the location of the infection. Types of candidiasis include:
Cutaneous candidiasis
. Cutaneous means
skin
. A cutaneous candidiasis infection causes red, raised patches to form in the folds of your skin, like in your underarms, under your breasts and near your buttocks (
diaper rash
).
Nail candidiasis (candidal paronychia)
. Nail candidiasis is an infection in your nail folds or cuticles. It causes redness, pain and swelling around your nails. In severe cases, your nail plate may separate from your nail bed (
onycholysis
).
Oral candidiasis (thrush)
.
Thrush is an infection that affects your mouth, throat, tongue or
esophagus
. It causes raised, white sores to develop, along with mouth pain, irritation and redness.
Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infection)
.
Vaginal candidiasis is a common infection that causes burning, itching and redness in your vulva and changes to your vaginal discharge. A vaginal yeast infection is a type of
vaginitis
.

A serious type of candidiasis is called
invasive candidiasis
. Invasive candidiasis is a life-threatening infection that occurs when
Candida
gets into your bloodstream and spreads to your internal organs. It most often affects people in hospitals and people with weakened immune systems.
Symptoms and Causes
A candidiasis infection causes symptoms where Candida naturally live in small amounts, like your skin, mouth, throat or vagina.
Symptoms of candidiasis
Candidiasis symptoms vary depending on the type and location of the infection. Symptoms of candidiasis may include:
Abnormal
vaginal discharge
Burning sensation
Difficulty swallowing (
dysphagia
)
Itching (
pruritus
)
Loss of taste (
ageusia
)
Pain and soreness
Skin rash
with small, raised bumps
White patches or
sores
in your mouth and throat
Many people who develop invasive candidiasis are already ill. So, it can be difficult to determine which symptoms are from their original conditions and which are from the infection. But as the infection spreads throughout your body, you may experience
fever
and
chills
.
Candidiasis causes
An overgrowth of
Candida
yeast causes candidiasis infections. This occurs when there’s an imbalance between healthy bacteria and
Candida
yeast on your body. Triggers that can disrupt this balance include:
Being
immunocompromised
Eating foods high in refined carbohydrates, sugar or yeast
Experiencing hormonal changes, like
pregnancy
or
menopause
Feeling stressed
Having certain medical conditions, including
cancer
,
diabetes
and
HIV/AIDS
Taking certain medications, including
antibiotics
,
oral contraceptives
and
steroids
Risk factors
Candidiasis can affect anyone because yeast naturally lives on your body, and it’s easy to upset the balance of healthy bacteria and yeast. But there are certain groups of people who are more likely to develop an infection. Candidiasis most often affects:
Catheter
users
Denture
users
Newborns and infants
People in hospitals
People with diabetes
Pregnant
women
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose candidiasis
Your healthcare provider will perform a
physical examination
of the affected area and ask you about your medical history. They’ll also ask you questions about your symptoms, including their severity and how long you’ve had them.
Your provider may be able to diagnose oral candidiasis by the appearance of your mouth or throat. For other types of candidiasis, they’ll likely request testing to confirm a diagnosis.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat a candidiasis infection?
The No. 1 treatment option for a candidiasis yeast infection is an
antifungal medication
. Depending on the type and severity of the infection, your healthcare provider may prescribe an antifungal that’s topical (cream or ointment) or oral (pill, lozenge or liquid). For severe infections, you may need to receive an antifungal intravenously (through a
vein
).
Invasive candidiasis will require more intensive treatment. Your provider will likely start with an intravenous antifungal like echinocandin.

Can I take over-the-counter medications to treat candidiasis?
Yes, you can take an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medication. But the success of OTC medicine is dependent on knowing which type of yeast you’re trying to treat. This can be difficult to identify without visiting your healthcare provider. They can perform a culture test of the infection and give you a specific plan to treat your infection.
How long does candidiasis last?
Most mild to moderate cases of candidiasis will clear up in two to three days after you complete treatment. More severe cases may take a couple of weeks to clear up completely after treatment.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should contact your healthcare provider when you notice any symptoms of candidiasis, including:
Itchiness
Pain
Rash
Swelling
Untreated candidiasis symptoms could become worse over time. So, it’s best to visit your provider at the first sign of infection to start treatment.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have candidiasis?
Treatment for candidiasis is extremely effective. Symptoms are bothersome but should start to fade after treatment begins. Infections usually clear up completely between two days and two weeks, depending on the type and severity.
If left untreated, symptoms of candidiasis can cause irritation and discomfort and could increase in severity over time. Sometimes, candidiasis returns after treatment, so it’s best to work with your healthcare provider on a treatment plan. They can target the specific type of yeast that caused the overgrowth on your body.

Prevention
Can candidiasis be prevented?
You may be able to prevent candidiasis by:
Maintaining good physical and
oral hygiene
Managing your stress
Reducing the amount of refined carbohydrates and sugar you eat
Talking with your healthcare provider about medications you’re taking
Treating current medical conditions
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Although candidiasis can cause uncomfortable symptoms like itching and soreness, you can rest easy knowing that it’s not usually a serious infection. Treatment with an antifungal medication should clear up your symptoms quickly. Each antifungal has specific instructions, so make sure you ask your healthcare provider to explain how to apply or take the medication and how long you should take it.
Even if your symptoms stop, continue taking the antifungal as advised by your provider. This will completely clear the infection and prevent it from coming back.
