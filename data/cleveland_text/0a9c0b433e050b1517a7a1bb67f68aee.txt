Rezūm Procedure
The Rezūm procedure treats benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition that causes your prostate to grow, which may block your urethra and cause symptoms that affect your ability to pee or ejaculate. The procedure uses steam to reduce prostate tissue and relieve symptoms of BPH. Long-term results are good, and you can repeat the procedure if you develop BPH symptoms again in the future.

Overview
What is Rezūm therapy?
Rezūm™ (pronounced “ruh-ZOOM”) therapy is a minimally invasive nonsurgical treatment for
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) that has good long-term results. It involves a special instrument that uses water vapor (steam) to shrink the enlarged areas of your
prostate
. The instrument goes through your urethra, so you won’t have incisions or need stitches. A healthcare provider will numb the area before the procedure to reduce discomfort.

Another name for Rezūm is water vapor therapy.
What conditions are treated with the Rezūm procedure?
The Rezūm procedure treats BPH. BPH is a condition that causes your prostate (the gland near your
bladder
, in front of your
rectum
) to grow, which may block your
urethra
and cause symptoms that affect your ability to pee or ejaculate. BPH commonly affects people over 50. But it may also begin when you’re younger.
Who is not a good candidate for Rezūm?
Healthcare providers may not recommend Rezūm if you have:
Kidney
function complications.
A urethral implant.
A very large prostate (over 80 grams).
Treatment Details
What happens during the Rezūm procedure?
Rezūm therapy takes place in a provider’s office. Before Rezūm therapy, a healthcare provider will instruct you to use the restroom. They’ll then use a local
anesthetic
to numb your urethra and prostate to make you more comfortable during the procedure.
A
urologist
will then insert a handheld device with a long, thin tube at the end into your urethra. A tiny needle releases from the end of the tube and delivers steam into the enlarged areas of your prostate. The steam destroys the prostate cells, causing the enlarged areas to shrink.
You’ll use a urinary catheter for several days until the swelling goes down.
How long does Rezūm therapy take?
Rezūm therapy usually takes about 30 minutes. Each individual treatment takes about 10 seconds. Up to 15 treatments can be given during one procedure.

Risks / Benefits
What are the potential benefits of Rezūm therapy?
Rezūm therapy is a safe, effective treatment for BPH with good long-term results. Other potential Rezūm procedure benefits include:
You no longer need to take BPH medications.
Many people see improvement in their BPH symptoms within a few weeks.
It preserves sexual function.
It’s an outpatient procedure (you can go home the same day as the procedure).
You don’t need general anesthesia.
Quick recovery period.
You can repeat the procedure if your BPH symptoms return.
How successful is the Rezūm procedure?
The Rezūm procedure’s success rate is good. Studies show that less than 5% of people need additional procedures or surgeries within five years after the procedure. About 10% of people need to take prostate medications within those first five years.
How many years does Rezūm last?
Rezūm therapy is a relatively new procedure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Rezūm therapy in 2015. Medical outcome studies indicate that Rezūm therapy effectively treats BPH symptoms for at least five years.
What is the downside of Rezūm?
Though the Rezūm procedure is relatively safe, there are some risks, including:
Pain or discomfort while peeing or ejaculating.
Peeing more than usual or having more
urgent urination
.
Blood in your pee (
hematuria
) or semen (
hematospermia
).
Urinary tract infection
(UTI).
Your penis doesn’t release semen when you reach sexual climax (dry ejaculation).
Narrowing of your urethra (
urethral strictures
).
Bladder stones
.
Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better after Rezūm therapy?
During the first few weeks, your BPH symptoms may get worse before they get better. Many people notice an improvement in their symptoms after several weeks. However, it may take up to three months to see a difference.
Is there anything I can do to make the Rezūm procedure easier on me?
The following instructions can help make your Rezūm procedure recovery easier for you.
Rest
. Your body needs time to heal after Rezūm therapy, and rest is essential for your recovery. Spending at least a day at home resting after your Rezūm procedure is a good idea. It’s OK to drive yourself home after the procedure and walk short distances. But avoid running, heavy lifting, bike riding and other strenuous activities for a few weeks.
Avoid sexual activity
. Avoid sexual intercourse and
masturbation
for a few days to help allow the area to heal.
Drink plenty of fluids, especially water
. Drinking lots of fluids helps flush blood out of your pee.
Avoid fluids that may irritate your bladder
. These may include drinks that contain caffeine (tea, coffee, energy drinks), carbonated beverages (seltzer water, soda pop) and citrus fruit juices (orange juice, grapefruit juice).
When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Schedule a follow-up appointment with your healthcare provider two to three weeks after Rezūm therapy. They’ll want to see how you’re healing.

Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between Aquablation and Rezūm therapy?
Aquablation® is another treatment for BPH. Like Rezūm therapy, it uses water to remove prostate tissue. But it uses a high-pressure, heat-free water jet instead of steam.
Rezūm therapy is a minimally invasive procedure that a healthcare provider can perform in an office setting. Providers must perform Aquablation in an operating room.
With Aquablation, the healthcare team removes the enlarged prostate tissue immediately. With Rezūm, steam damages and shrinks the tissue over several weeks to months. Aquablation typically has faster and more dramatic improvements in your ability to pee.
What is the difference between Rezūm therapy and TURP?
Transurethral resection of the prostate
(TURP) is a type of surgery that uses an electric current or laser to remove part of your prostate. Similar to Aquablation, the improvements are usually better than an office-based treatment like Rezūm therapy. However, surgery generally has more risks.
What is the cost of Rezūm?
Insurance coverage for Rezūm therapy is excellent. The price varies among healthcare providers, medical facilities and healthcare coverage. Talk to a provider to get a better idea of its cost.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition that can cause problems when you pee, and Rezūm therapy is a relatively new treatment for BPH symptoms. It’s a safe and effective procedure with good long-term results and allows for shrinking the prostate without needing to have surgery in an operating room. Talk to a healthcare provider if BPH is affecting your quality of life. The Rezūm procedure may be a good option if medications or other front-line treatments don’t work for you.
