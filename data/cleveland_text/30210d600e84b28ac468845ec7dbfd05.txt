Pneumocystis Pneumonia
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a lung infection that mainly affects people with weakened immune systems. The fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii causes it. Providers treat it with antibiotics or antifungal medications. See a healthcare provider right away if you think you have Pneumocystis pneumonia. It can be fatal if left untreated.

What Is Pneumocystis Pneumonia?
Pneumocystis
pneumonia (PCP or PJP) is a lung infection you get from the fungus
Pneumocystis jirovecii.
It almost exclusively affects people with
weakened (compromised) immune systems
, including people who have:

HIV/AIDS
Certain types of cancer (usually
lymphomas
and
leukemias
)
Received a
stem cell
, organ or
bone marrow
transplant
Chronic lung conditions
Autoimmune disorders
Used high-dose
corticosteroids
over a long period of time
If you think you have
Pneumocystis
pneumonia and have a compromised immune system, seek immediate medical attention. PCP can be fatal if left untreated.
Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia used to be called
Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, which is why it’s abbreviated PCP. While it can cause serious illness in people with compromised immune systems, it’s rare in people with healthy immune systems.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs and symptoms of
Pneumocystis
pneumonia?
Symptoms of
Pneumocystis
pneumonia include:
Fever
Chills
Cough
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
Headache
Fatigue
Feeling of chest tightness or chest pain with breathing
Bluish skin, lips or nails (
cyanosis
)
In most people, symptoms come on quickly, over only a few days. In people with HIV, symptoms can come on slowly, over a few weeks.
What causes
Pneumocystis
pneumonia?
The
fungus
Pneumocystis jirovecii
(
P. jirovecii
) causes PCP. Studies suggest that — unlike many types of fungi —
P. jirovecii
only lives in humans, rather than in the environment around us.
How do you get
Pneumocystis
pneumonia?
You get
Pneumocystis
pneumonia from other people.
P. jirovecii
is transmitted from one person to another through the air when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. Most of us are exposed to
P. jirovecii
in our lives — usually before age 4 — but don’t have symptoms or have mild symptoms. You can spread PCP to people who have compromised immune systems, even if you have no symptoms.

What are the risk factors?
Most people who get PCP have a weakened immune system. Specifically, it most commonly affects people who have issues with
T cell
function. T cells are a specialized part of your immune system that help you recognize and fight infections.
Health conditions that put you at a higher risk for PCP include:
HIV
Cancer, especially blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma
Receiving a stem cell, solid organ or bone marrow transplant
Severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID)
About 30-40% of PCP cases
are in people with HIV. It’s one of the most common
AIDS-defining illnesses
. Your risk is higher if you don’t take medications to manage HIV (
antiretroviral therapy
).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is
Pneumocystis
pneumonia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose PCP by looking for signs of
P. jirovecii
in your mucus or fluids from your lungs. To get a sample to test, they might use:
A sputum test
: You cough and then spit into a container to get a sample.
Bronchoalveolar lavage
: During a
bronchoscopy
procedure, your provider uses a solution to “wash” your airways and get a fluid sample.
Your provider can also use a chest X-ray or CT scan to take pictures of your lungs and look for signs of pneumonia.
Management and Treatment
How is
Pneumocystis
pneumonia treated?
Healthcare providers treat
Pneumocystis
pneumonia with high doses of the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Antibiotics are effective in treating certain fungal infections. Other treatments include:
Atovaquone
Pentamidine
Dapsone
Clindamycin
Primaquine
You might need a
ventilator
to help you breathe. If your lungs are working but you’re not getting enough oxygen, your provider might give you extra oxygen through a tube in your nose or mask on your face. Your provider may also give you corticosteroids to decrease inflammation in your lungs.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have HIV or another condition that weakens your immune system, talk to your provider about preventing infections. See a provider right away if you have a weakened immune system and you have symptoms of PCP or any other infection.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of a severe illness, including:
High fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius)
Difficulty breathing
Persistent cough
Chest pain
Bluish skin, lips or nails
Confusion
Seizures
If you have a weakened immune system, ask your provider if you should go to the ER sooner than what’s listed here. You may need emergency care right away or with less severe symptoms.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can you recover from
Pneumocystis
pneumonia?
Pneumocystis
pneumonia can be cured with medication, but you need to start treatment as soon as possible. Because only people with weakened immune systems get sick with PCP, it can quickly make you seriously ill. Your provider may start treatment before all of your test results come back.
Pneumocystis
pneumonia is almost always fatal if left untreated.

How long does it take to recover?
How long it takes to recover from PCP depends on how severe your case is. You may need to be treated in the hospital. You’ll need to take medication for three weeks, but it may take longer to feel completely better.
What is the survival rate of
Pneumocystis
pneumonia?
It’s hard for experts to estimate a
Pneumocystis
pneumonia survival rate. In general,
mortality rates for PCP
are higher in people with compromised immune systems who don’t have HIV than those with HIV.
Prevention
Can
Pneumocystis
pneumonia be prevented?
Since most people don’t have symptoms of a
Pneumocystis
infection, it can be hard to avoid being exposed. Having good
handwashing habits
, avoiding other people when you’re sick, and covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
If you smoke, your provider will recommend that you quit. Smoking can increase the risk of
Pneumocystis
infection and make it more likely you’ll get severely sick.
Your healthcare provider might prescribe medication to help prevent a
Pneumocystis
infection if you:
Have HIV/AIDS and a
CD4 count
of 200 or fewer cells per cubic millimeter
Regularly take medications that suppress your immune system (for example, if you take high doses of daily corticosteroids for a month or longer)
Have had an organ or stem cell transplant within the past year
Have another condition that compromises your immune system, including SCID,
hypogammaglobulinemia
and
graft vs. host disease
Have had
Pneumocystis
pneumonia before

Providers prescribe the same medications to both prevent and treat PCP.
Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between pneumonia and
Pneumocystis
pneumonia?
Anyone can get the most common kinds of pneumonia from viruses, bacteria and fungi. But only the fungus
Pneumocystis jirovecii
can cause
Pneumocystis
pneumonia
.
Most people who get
Pneumocystis
pneumonia have compromised immune systems.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Most of us will encounter
Pneumocystis jirovecii
in our lives and never even know it. But if you have a compromised immune system, it can make you seriously ill. Fortunately, if you’re diagnosed and treated early, you can make a full recovery.
If you have a weakened immune system — or a condition that puts you at risk for one — don’t ignore symptoms of infections. Talk to your provider about prevention strategies and don’t be afraid to ask questions about managing your condition. You can work together to make a plan that will keep you healthy.
