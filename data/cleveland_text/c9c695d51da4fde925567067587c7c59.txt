Overview
What is chin reduction surgery?
Chin reduction surgery is a procedure to reduce the size of your chin. You may have this procedure if you feel your chin is very long, wide or projects too far past your nose. The surgery can help improve the balance between your chin and your other facial features. Chin reduction surgery is also called chin shaving surgery or mentoplasty.

What happens during chin reduction surgery?
You receive general
anesthesia
for chin reduction surgery. This type of anesthesia puts you to sleep, so you don’t feel any pain during the procedure. Chin reduction surgery can take anywhere from one to three hours. Your surgeon:
Makes an incision (cut) inside of your mouth, under your chin or both.
Uses surgical tools to shave or cut away part of your chin bone.
Shapes your chin so it’s symmetrical with your other facial features.
Stitches the incision closed.
What happens after chin reduction surgery?
Chin reduction surgery is usually an outpatient procedure, so you go home the same day as your surgery. Your healthcare provider will give you specific instructions about oral care and/or cleaning and taking care of your incision.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Chin reduction surgery reduces your chin’s length, width or overall size. The procedure can give a more balanced look to your facial features. It’s usually a cosmetic procedure, but some people get it for medical reasons such as jaw or teeth problems. It’s a relatively safe outpatient procedure, but it does come with some risks. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out if chin reduction surgery is right for you.
