Boutonnière Deformity
If you have a boutonnière deformity, the joints in your finger are stuck in abnormal positions. One knuckle is bent forward and the other backward. This happens when the central slip tendon that pulls your finger straight gets injured or displaced.

What Is Boutonnière Deformity?
A boutonnière deformity of the finger results from a tear in the central slip extensor at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP).
Boutonnière deformity is a condition that affects your ability to straighten the middle joint of a finger (or, less commonly, a toe). Your middle joint is stuck in a bent position and won’t straighten. At the same time, the joint toward the tip of your finger or toe is flexed upward.

A boutonnière deformity can happen if you injure a
tendon
in your finger called the central slip. This is the tendon that allows you to straighten your finger at the middle joint. It runs over the top of your finger, and you might be able to see it where it passes over your knuckles.
If an injury stretches or tears this tendon, it creates a split in the fibers that looks like a buttonhole. (Boutonnière means “buttonhole” in French.) If this tear isn’t repaired, the tendon won’t work right, and you won’t be able to straighten your finger joints.
Central slip injuries are the most common cause of boutonnière deformity, but
arthritis
can also cause it. In this case, damage to the soft tissues in your finger may force the tendon out of place by stretching it or weakening it. This can have the same effect as a tear.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of boutonnière deformity
The primary symptom of boutonnière deformity is the abnormal position of your finger joints. You’ll be unable to straighten the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal or PIP joint). Also, the joint at the tip (distal interphalangeal or DIP joint) will be hyperextended.
You may also have:
Pain
and
swelling
in the joints
Stiffness that gets worse with time
Symptoms may develop immediately after a finger injury or up to several weeks afterward. If you have
arthritis of the hand
, boutonnière deformity may develop very gradually. The first sign may be that your finger just doesn’t bend and straighten as easily as it should.

Causes of boutonnière deformity
Boutonnière deformity is usually the result of a
traumatic injury
to your central slip tendon.
Examples include:
A
jammed finger
that tears the tendon as well as ligaments
A
broken finger
where the bone stretches or tears the tendon
A finger joint
dislocation
that stretches or tears the tendon
Blunt or penetrating trauma to your finger and the tendon
Anyone can get a central slip injury, but it’s more common in athletes, who are prone to
sports injuries
.
Other possible causes include:
Rheumatoid arthritis
. Constant inflammation and swelling in your hand can weaken the tendon.
Burn injuries
. Burns can weaken the tendon and, in some cases, can lead to rupture.
Congenital hand deformity
. Boutonnière deformity may be a
birth defect
(congenital disorder).
Connective tissue diseases
. Certain genetic disorders can weaken your connective tissues.
Your central slip tendon works together with a network of other tendons that extend your finger. They’re called
extensor tendons
. If the central slip slackens or ruptures, it can’t pull your PIP joint. It also affects the extensors that pull your DIP joint, making them pull more.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose boutonnière deformity
A healthcare provider will examine your finger and ask you about your symptoms and health history. Boutonnière deformity is easy to recognize on sight. But if it’s just starting to develop, it might not be obvious yet. They might perform a quick test called Elson’s test.
They’ll ask you to curl your fingers around the edge of a table. They’ll gently press down on the bone in your forefinger (middle phalanx). Then, they’ll ask you to straighten your finger against their resistance. If you can’t straighten it, they’ll know your central slip is impaired.
Your provider might want to follow up with
X-rays
to evaluate the injury and plan your treatment.
Management and Treatment
How is boutonnière deformity treated?
Most of the time, healthcare providers start with conservative (nonsurgical) treatments for boutonnière deformity. But it’s important to treat it sooner than later. The longer it goes untreated, the harder it may be to correct the deformity, even with surgery.
Conservative treatment for boutonnière deformity
If your condition is relatively recent, your healthcare provider will start by
splinting your finger
. The splint will hold your PIP joint in an extended position for several months while the injured tendon heals. After this, you’ll have several months of
physiotherapy
.
Surgical treatment for boutonnière deformity
For severe injuries and older conditions that have failed to heal with conservative treatment, you might need
surgery
. You might have scar tissue in your finger that’s holding it in the wrong position, or your surgeon might need to put parts back where they belong.
Your
surgeon
might:

Repair or reconstruct the central slip tendon
Reposition or
release tension
in other extensor tendons
Repair or
fuse
the PIP joint (if arthritis is involved)
After surgery, you’ll wear a finger splint for several weeks while your finger heals. After the first week, you’ll have hand exercises to practice as you recover. Your
physiotherapist
or hand therapist will guide your rehabilitation during the next few months.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have boutonnière deformity?
Boutonnière deformity is treatable, but timing matters. If you get treatment right away after an injury, you may recover completely, with or without surgery. If it takes a while to recognize and treat your boutonnière deformity, it may be more challenging.
The cause of your deformity also matters. Chronic conditions like arthritis can interfere with healing and recovery. Severe injuries and congenital disorders may be harder to fix with surgery. Sometimes, surgeons can restore some of your finger joint flexibility, but not all.
Recovering from boutonnière deformity can take many months, and it requires active participation from you — especially when it’s time to start exercising your finger. But most people who follow their healthcare team’s guidance will have good outcomes.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you’ve injured your finger and can’t move it, have a healthcare provider look at it. Don’t assume, because fingers are small, that your injury is also minor. Fingers are complex and delicate, and an injury can do more damage than you might think.
Damage to one tendon in the top of your finger can also affect other tendons connected to it. Before you know it, the mechanics that allow you to move your finger at will can fall apart. To recover, you’ll have to rehabilitate these very small parts.
