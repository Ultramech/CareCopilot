Barotrauma
Barotrauma is the overarching term for medical conditions caused by sudden or significant shifts in air or water pressure. Most barotrauma conditions aren’t serious, and their symptoms go away without treatment. But in some instances, barotrauma may be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.

What Is Barotrauma?
Barotrauma refers to the way a sudden change in barometric (air) or water pressure affects your body. Ear barotrauma is the most common type and often affects the middle ear. Other types may affect your lungs, gastrointestinal tract or sinuses. You may experience barotrauma while flying in an airplane or deep-water diving.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of barotrauma
Barotrauma causes different symptoms. Your symptoms will depend on the part of your body that air and water pressure changes affect.

Ear barotrauma (airplane ear) symptoms may include:
A feeling that your ears are full or stuffed up
Dizziness
Hearing issues

Sinus barotrauma symptoms
You may experience sinus barotrauma symptoms while doing free diving or scuba diving. Symptoms may include:

Facial pain
Headache
Nasal congestion
Barotrauma causes
Barotrauma happens when air or water pressure changes faster than your body is able to adapt. That can happen while flying in an airplane or scuba diving.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose barotrauma
A healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms. They’ll ask if symptoms started after you did things like fly in an airplane or diving. A provider will do a
physical exam
. They’ll use different tests to diagnose specific barotrauma types.
Ear barotrauma diagnosis
Healthcare providers may look inside your ear with an otoscope. This is a special lighted instrument that providers use to check
eardrum
damage, signs of infection or other issues. They may do other tests like:
Hearing test
MRI
scan to view
your inner ear
Gastrointestinal barotrauma diagnosis
A healthcare provider may do the following tests if they think you have a GI rupture:
Chest X-ray
CT scan
Pulmonary barotrauma diagnosis
Healthcare providers may do the following tests to diagnose pulmonary barotrauma:
Arterial blood gas test
Chest X-ray
EKG
Sinus barotrauma diagnosis
A provider will examine your nose. Tests may include:
Endoscopy
to look at the inside of your nose
CT scan to get images of your sinuses
Management and Treatment
How is barotrauma treated?
Treatment depends on the barotrauma type. Potential treatments for barotrauma are:
Nasal decongestants
for ear and sinus barotrauma
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
and
IV fluids
for pulmonary barotrauma. You may need more intensive treatment if you have severe symptoms
Typically, people don’t need treatment for gastrointestinal barotrauma. The exception is when the condition causes a perforation that requires surgery.
When should I seek care?
You should talk to a healthcare provider if ear or sinus barotrauma symptoms don’t go away or if they get worse. But gastrointestinal and pulmonary barotrauma may cause complications that can be life-threatening. You should go to an emergency room if you have:
Gastrointestinal barotrauma and you have sudden severe belly pain
Pulmonary barotrauma and you have chest pain or shortness of breath

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this?
Your prognosis or expected outcome depends on your situation. For example, if you have airplane ear, you may not need any treatment. But you may need surgery if barotrauma damages your eardrum. If you have a form of barotrauma, a healthcare provider is your best resource for information. They’ll tell you what you can expect.
Prevention
Can I prevent barotrauma?
Yes, in most cases, you can prevent barotrauma:
If you’re flying on an airplane, invest in special earplugs. Chew gum, yawn or blow your nose to protect your ears from air pressure changes.
If you scuba dive, follow safe diving practices. That will help you reduce the risk of gastrointestinal, pulmonary and sinus barotrauma. Organizations like the Divers Alert Network (DAN) offer safe diving practice training.

How do I take care of myself?
Barotrauma covers a wide range of medical conditions. Some are more serious than others. Contact your healthcare provider if you’ve experienced significant air and water pressure changes that might affect your health.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Barotrauma happens when your body can’t adapt fast enough to changes in air and/or water pressure. You may develop barotrauma while flying in an airplane or scuba diving. Barotrauma can be a serious medical issue, particularly if it affects your lungs or your gut. But there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of barotrauma.
