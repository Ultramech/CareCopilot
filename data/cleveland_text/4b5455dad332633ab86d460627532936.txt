Overview
What is a UTI during pregnancy?
A
urinary tract infection
(UTI) during pregnancy is an infection in your urinary system that occurs during pregnancy. Your urinary system includes your:

Urethra

Kidneys
.
This system usually works to filter waste and extra water from your body as pee (urinate) — without contamination. As long as it’s inside you, there’s usually no bacteria in it. But there are lots of bacteria on the outside of your body. If it moves into your
urinary system
, an infection can develop.
Pregnancy
increases your risk of developing urinary tract infections. During pregnancy — especially weeks six to 24 — your urinary tract changes as your uterus grows. The increased weight and pressure of your uterus on your bladder can block urine from flowing, making it an ideal environment for bacteria. Pregnancy also suppresses your
immune system
, which is your body’s natural defense against illness. This can increase your risk of infection, including UTIs.
What are the different types of urinary tract infections?
There are a few different types of urinary tract infections that can affect your
urinary system
:
Asymptomatic bacteriuria
(ASB) is usually caused by bacteria that were in your body before you became pregnant. Because it has no symptoms, healthcare providers usually screen for ASB through a urine test at the first
prenatal appointment
.
Urethritis
involves your urethra, the tube that carries pee out of your body.
Cystitis
involves your bladder, which holds your pee.
Pyelonephritis
affects your kidneys.

Symptoms and Causes
What are UTI symptoms during pregnancy?
The most common signs and symptoms of a UTI while pregnant include:
Pain when peeing (dysuria)
.
Blood in your pee
.
Abnormal urine color (cloudy appearance) with a strong smell.
Incontinence
(leaking pee).
Increased and urgent need to pee
.
Pain during sex
.
Less common UTI symptoms during pregnancy include:
Fever
(temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 37.77 degrees Celsius).
Chills.
Mental changes or confusion.
Vomiting
.
Pain in your side (flank)
.
While less common, be sure to report any of these signs and symptoms to your healthcare provider.
What causes UTI during pregnancy?
The same organism that causes UTIs when you're not pregnant is the most common cause of UTI during pregnancy:
Escherichia coli
(
E. coli
).
It causes 80% to 90% of UTIs during pregnancy.
E. coli
is commonly found in stool (poop), and it can easily travel into your urethra.
Wiping from back to front (rather than front to back) can push
E. coli
bacteria into your urethra.
Other types of bacteria that cause UTIs include:
Proteus mirabilis.
Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Group B streptococcus
.
Staphylococcus saprophyticus
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a UTI during pregnancy diagnosed?
A healthcare provider can use two tests to diagnose a UTI during pregnancy. For both tests, you pee into a cup, and then, a healthcare professional analyzes it:
Urinalysis
:
This test checks your urine for white blood cells, red blood cells and bacteria. The amount of white and red blood cells may indicate an infection.
Urine culture
:
This test looks at the type of bacteria in your urine. Knowing the type of bacteria causing the infection helps your provider determine the best treatment.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for UTI during pregnancy?
UTIs require antibiotics. Your provider will prescribe an
antibiotic
that’s safe and effective — for both you and the developing fetus. You’ll likely take the antibiotics for at least three to seven days.
Do I need a healthcare professional to treat a UTI during pregnancy?
Yes. You need a prescription from a healthcare provider for antibiotics.
Can I treat a UTI at home while pregnant?
There are no at-home treatments that guarantee a cure for UTI. UTIs can turn into serious kidney infections. So, if you suspect you have a UTI during pregnancy, call your healthcare provider.
How soon after treatment for a UTI will I feel better?
When you take the medication as directed, your symptoms should start to clear up by day three. (But be sure to finish your whole prescription per the directions and your provider.) If they don’t, call your healthcare provider.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for someone with a UTI during pregnancy?
The prognosis for a UTI during pregnancy is very good. This common condition is easily treated with prescription antibiotics. Follow your medication directions closely and take the full course of treatment. If your symptoms continue or get worse, call your healthcare provider.

Prevention
How can I prevent a UTI during pregnancy?
UTIs can happen despite doing everything right. To lower your risk of UTI during pregnancy, follow these best practices:
Do:
Drink plenty of fluids (six to eight glasses per day), especially water and unsweetened cranberry juice.
Pee before and after having sex.
Pee at the first sign of having to go and empty your bladder completely.
Talk to your healthcare provider about the right prenatal vitamins and supplements for you before you take any. But in general, for UTI prevention, take at least 250 to 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 25,000 to 50,000 IU of beta-carotene and 30 to 50 milligrams of zinc each day.
Wipe front to back and keep your genital area clean and dry.
Change your underwear every day and wear cotton or cotton-crotch underwear.
Don’t:
Soak in a bathtub for longer than 30 minutes and no more than twice per day.
Wear tight-fitting pants, leggings or pantyhose too often.
Use harsh soaps (containing fragrance or high pH), douches or feminine hygiene sprays.

When should I seek care for a UTI during pregnancy?
If you have symptoms of a UTI while pregnant, call your provider. Seek care immediately if you have these symptoms, which may indicate the infection has spread to your kidneys:
Fever.
Back pain.
Chills.
Nausea or vomiting.
How do I take care of myself when I have a UTI during pregnancy?
As you wait for the antibiotics to kick in and relieve uncomfortable symptoms, you can:

Talk to your provider about over-the-counter pain relievers that are safe to take during pregnancy. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and phenazopyridine (AZO®), a UTI-specific pain reliever.
Drink plenty of water to keep your urine clear.
Empty your bladder completely and often.
Additional Common Questions
How common are UTIs during pregnancy?
UTIs while pregnant are very common. As many as 8% of pregnant
women
may experience a UTI.
Can a UTI while pregnant hurt the fetus?
A UTI during pregnancy typically doesn’t affect the fetus. But if the bacteria move to your kidneys, the UTI can turn into a more serious kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Kidney infections sometimes cause early labor and/or low birth weight.
Can a UTI cause a miscarriage?
No. A UTI can’t cause a
miscarriage
. But complications resulting from an untreated UTI can, so it’s important to get treatment for a UTI.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your body goes through so many changes in pregnancy that you might think some symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) — like leaking pee and needing to pee more often — are expected pregnancy changes. But if you notice these symptoms, especially if they’re combined with others like pain when peeing or during sex, cloudy pee or fever, contact your healthcare provider. UTIs are more common during pregnancy because of changes in your body. And they’re treatable.
