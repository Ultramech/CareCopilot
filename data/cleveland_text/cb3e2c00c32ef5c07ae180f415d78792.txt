Overview
What does it mean to have crystals in your urine?
Crystals in urine occur when there are too many minerals in your urine and not enough liquid. The tiny pieces collect and form masses. These crystals may be found during urine tests (
urinalysis
). Having crystals in your urine is called crystalluria.

Some crystals don’t cause problems. Others can get big and form stones that get stuck in parts of your urinary tract and cause blockages. Blockages can cause serious problems, like acute kidney injury (AKI), which is also called
acute renal failure
(ARF).
What are common types of crystals found in urine?
Types of crystals that a lab tech might see in your urine include:
Ammonium biurate.
Bilirubin.
Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate.
Cystine.
Hippuric acid.
Leucine.
Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate).
Tyrosine.
Uric acid.
Xanthine.
The laboratory test can identify the type of crystals by the shape of the crystals under a microscope. Some of the crystals may have no identifiable shape (amorphous).
The pH (acidity) of your urine can contribute to the type of crystals that happen.
Who gets crystals in their urine?
Anyone can have crystals in their urine. The presence of crystals doesn’t always mean that you have some type of medical condition, though, except in the case of cystine and xanthine. These crystals indicate rare inherited disorders.
People who are prone to developing
kidney stones
also may have crystals evident in their urine.
How does having crystals in my urine affect my body?
You might have crystals in your urine that really don’t mean anything. Others can cause problems, like kidney stones. When crystals collect into bigger masses, they can block urine from leaving your body. Some crystals can pass through your urinary tract and out of your body on their own, while others may need to be removed from your body by a healthcare provider.

Diagnosis and Tests

Treatment depends on the cause of the crystals. In many cases, you may just need to drink more water or cut back on your consumption of certain foods or things found in foods, like salt and sugar.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should contact your healthcare provider if you have pain or fever along with
changes in your urine
. Kidney stones and other stones, like
ureteral stones
, can be very painful. They can also cause toxins to stay in your system and cause problems.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Crystalluria, or having crystals in your urine, is relatively common. Crystals can be found in the urine of people who are completely healthy and in the urine of people who have some type of illness. They might be found on a routine urine test or if your healthcare provider suspects another condition. One of the best ways to prevent crystals from developing is by drinking enough fluids.
