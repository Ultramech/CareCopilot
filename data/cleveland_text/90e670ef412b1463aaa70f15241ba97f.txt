Overview
What is a neurocutaneous syndrome?
Neurocutaneous syndromes are a group of disorders that cause tumors to grow. These tumors can be cancerous or noncancerous. People are born with it (it’s congenital), but you might not develop symptoms until you’re older. Neurocutaneous syndromes are also known as phakomatoses.

Neurofibromatosis 2:
Causes
acoustic neuroma
s, vision problems, hearing loss and light-brown birthmarks.

Can neurocutaneous syndromes cause complications?
People with neurocutaneous syndromes are also at higher risk of developing certain types of
cancers
. Neurocutaneous syndromes also increase your risk of:
Developmental delays
.
Epilepsy
.
Headaches
.
High blood pressure (hypertension)
.
Learning disabilities
.
Tumors.
What causes a neurocutaneous syndrome?
Neurocutaneous syndromes develop because of changes (mutations) in certain genes. Sometimes, biological parents pass these gene changes to their children. But sometimes, the gene mutations occur without any family history or known cause.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose neurocutaneous syndromes?
In children, healthcare providers begin with a
well-child visit
. Your provider will talk with you about any symptoms you notice and whether your child is meeting
child development
milestones.
Symptoms of neurocutaneous syndromes in adults may occur later in life. Your healthcare provider will talk with you about your symptoms and do a
physical examination
.
If your provider suspects a neurocutaneous syndrome, they’ll order more testing.
What tests do healthcare providers use to diagnose neurocutaneous syndromes?
Healthcare providers typically diagnose neurocutaneous syndromes through blood and imaging tests. Your provider may recommend:
CT scan
.
Electroencephalogram
.
Laboratory tests (blood or
urine
tests).
MRI
.
Skin biopsy
or tumor biopsy.
Management and Treatment
How do healthcare providers treat neurocutaneous syndromes?
There aren’t any treatments for neurocutaneous syndromes. Instead, providers treat specific symptoms.
How should I care for my child with a neurocutaneous syndrome?
Children with neurocutaneous syndromes need lifelong care. Talk to your healthcare provider about how to care for your child’s symptoms. Make sure to:

preconception counseling
can help you understand whether you could pass certain genetic mutations to your child.
How do I know if I’m at risk for a neurocutaneous syndrome?
If someone in your family has a neurocutaneous syndrome, you (or your child) might be at higher risk for these conditions. Let your healthcare provider know if someone in your family has one of these syndromes. They may recommend genetic testing to check for gene mutations.
