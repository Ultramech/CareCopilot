Coma
A coma is a deep unconscious state where you can’t wake up or respond, even to pain or loud sounds. Head injuries, strokes, infections or overdoses, among other things, can cause it. A coma is a medical emergency. Treatment focuses on finding and managing the cause to prevent lasting damage.

What Is a Coma?
A coma happens when you’re unconscious, unresponsive and unaware of what’s going on around you. You can’t wake up, think, talk, respond to a conversation or react to the feeling of pain.

There are several possible causes, like brain injuries, stroke, complications from substance use or infections, among others.
A coma is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. It’s a common reason people end up in emergency rooms.
Comas typically don’t last longer than a couple of weeks. Severe brain injuries may lead to a persistent vegetative state or possible brain death. Delaying treatment may lead to serious complications or life-threatening outcomes.
Types of coma
The types vary based on the cause:
Anoxic brain injury
: Caused by a lack of oxygen to your brain (like after a
cardiac arrest
or drowning)
Diabetes-related
: Due to very low or very high blood sugar levels
Medically induced
: A controlled coma in a medical setting to help the brain rest
Toxic-
metabolic encephalopathy
: From too much or too little of certain chemicals in your body (like overdose)
Trauma-induced
: Caused by a head injury
Symptoms and Causes
A coma is when you’re unconscious, unresponsive and unaware of what’s going on around you.
Symptoms of a coma
Signs and symptoms may include:
Closed eyes
Pupils
that don’t respond to light when the eyes are opened
No movement except reflexes
No response to pain or loud noises
No speech, communication or awareness
Slow, irregular or gasping breathing patterns
Loss of consciousness
These can vary from person to person. While many signs are common, some people may move differently. Comas also range in severity.

Causes of a coma
A coma occurs when something disrupts how your brain works. This could happen to your:
Brainstem’s
reticular activating system
: A network of
nerve
cells (neurons) that keeps you awake
Cerebral hemispheres
: The two largest areas of your brain that help you think
Common causes may include:
A
lack of oxygen
or blood flow to the brain
Brain tumors
Extreme body temperatures (high or low)
Head injuries
Infection (
meningitis
or
encephalitis
)
Metabolic issues (blood sugar levels,
liver
or
kidney
failure)
Seizures (
status epilepticus
)
Stroke
Substance overdose (
opioids
, alcohol)
Risk factors
Anyone can fall into a coma. But you might be more at risk if you have:
A
substance use disorder
Diabetes
(with very high or low blood sugar)
Epilepsy
or other seizure disorders
Heart problems
High
blood pressure
or
cholesterol
Low thyroid levels
Your risk also goes up if you skip a helmet during activities like biking, motorcycling or contact sports, or if you don’t wear a seatbelt in the car.
Complications of a coma
If you’re in a coma, you can’t care for yourself. You’ll need around-the-clock medical support. You might need
tube feeding
, a
urinary catheter
to collect pee and a ventilator to help you breathe.
Complications from being in a coma or receiving coma-related care may include:
Bedsores
Blood clots
Delirium
Infections, like
pneumonia
from a ventilator or
UTIs
from a catheter
Muscle loss
and weakness
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose a coma
If you’re unconscious, providers will immediately check your
vitals
, which include your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. They may offer immediate treatment, like sugar for low blood sugar or opioid reversal medication if they suspect an overdose.
Your providers will perform a
physical
and
neurological
exam. They’ll use the
Glasgow Coma Scale
to identify the severity. The GCS measures three categories:
Eye response (1 to 4)
Motor response (1 to 6)
Verbal response (1 to 5)
A total score ranges from 3 to 15. A score of 15 means fully alert, and 8 or below usually indicates a coma.
What tests diagnose a coma?
Tests help confirm a diagnosis and find the cause. Common tests include:
Lab tests (blood, urine,
spinal fluid
) to check for infections, toxins, organ issues or imbalances
Imaging (
CT
or
MRI
) to look for brain injuries or damage
EEG
to track brain activity and seizures
EKG
to detect heart rhythm problems
Your provider may need other tests based on the situation. A healthcare provider can explain what’s being done and why.
Disorders of consciousness
Severe brain injuries can lead to disorders of consciousness. This describes how awake and aware a person is. A provider might use these terms to describe a diagnosis better:
Advertisement
Vegetative state
: Awake but unaware of yourself or your surroundings
Persistent vegetative state
: Awake but unaware, and lasting more than one month
Minimally conscious state
: Limited, inconsistent signs of awareness
Confusional state
: Some awareness, but disoriented and confused
Coma
: Loss of consciousness, unaware and unresponsive
Brain death
: Complete and irreversible loss of all brain function
Management and Treatment
How is a coma treated?
Treatment may include:
Making sure you’re safe
: Your
care team
will help you breathe using a ventilator and keep your heart beating by giving you fluids through an IV.
Handling emergencies
: Depending on the cause, you may need IV sugar (dextrose) for low blood sugar, an injection of
naloxone
for an overdose or
medications
for seizures.
Managing the cause
: You may need
antibiotics
for infections, surgery for head injuries or medicine for heart problems, among other treatments, to prevent complications.
Your care team will watch how your body responds. They may use the Glasgow Coma Scale to check your progress.
Coma recovery scale
As you recover, your body and brain need time to heal. You may not be able to talk or move right away. But even small signs of awareness, like following something with your eyes, are important. Healthcare providers use the Coma Recovery Scale to track these signs.

The scale measures:
Body movement
Eye movement
Sounds and speech
Touch and pain responses
This scale helps your care team see how you’re progressing. It can help them choose the right treatments to support your recovery.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I am in a coma?
Being in a coma means you’re not conscious, so you don’t know you’re in a coma. You don’t show any signs of awareness of the world around you, and you can’t react to your environment or your body’s needs. Depending on the depth of the coma, you may still have some reflex responses. But these vary from case to case.
How long does a coma last?
A coma can be very brief and last only a few minutes, or it can last as long as one to two weeks. Unfortunately,
death
is a possible complication. This is more likely with severe injuries, serious illness or delayed medical care.
Most comas don’t last more than a few weeks. People often either wake up or shift into a different state of reduced consciousness.
The outcome depends on many factors. A healthcare provider familiar with the case is the best person to explain what to expect.
How to make sure your wishes are followed if you can’t speak for yourself
If you’re ever in a coma, loved ones will have to make medical decisions for you. Talking with them ahead of time about your wishes and putting those wishes in writing can help ensure your choices are respected.
Legal
documents like
advance directives
can guide your care if you’re unable to decide for yourself.

Additional Common Questions
Can I hear or remember things that happened while I was in a coma?
It’s possible. Some people in a coma can hear what’s happening around them and even remember parts of it later. But this varies a lot and is hard to predict. A healthcare provider can help you understand what this might mean for you or your loved one’s recovery.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A coma can feel especially frightening, not just because it’s serious, but because it often comes with so many unknowns. When someone you love is unresponsive, it’s natural to feel scared, helpless and full of questions.
What’s important to know is that no two comas are the same. They can have many causes and lead to different outcomes. Some people wake up quickly, while others take longer or need more support. Care teams act fast to protect the brain and give each person the best chance at recovery.
If you or a loved one has a condition that raises the risk of coma, staying on top of treatment matters. And if you’ve thought about making your healthcare wishes known, now is a good time to complete an advance directive.
