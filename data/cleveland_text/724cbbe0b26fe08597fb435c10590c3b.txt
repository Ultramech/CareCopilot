With PMDD, you might have PMS symptoms along with extreme irritability, anxiety or depression. These symptoms improve within a few days after your period starts, but they can be severe enough to interfere with your life.
How common is this condition?
PMDD affects up to 10% of people who have periods.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of PMDD?
Symptoms of PMDD vary by individual. They tend to appear a week or two before menstruation and go away within a few days of your period starting. In addition to PMS symptoms like cramping and bloating, you may have:
Anger or irritability.
Feeling on edge, overwhelmed or tense.
Anxiety and
panic attacks
.
Depression and
suicidal thoughts
.
Difficulty concentrating.
Fatigue
and low energy.
Food cravings,
binge eating
or changes in appetite.

What causes PMDD?
Experts don’t know why some people get PMDD. Decreasing levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones after
ovulation
and before
menstruation
may trigger symptoms. Serotonin, a brain chemical that regulates mood, hunger and sleep, may also play a role. Serotonin levels, like hormone levels, change throughout your menstrual cycle.

You may be more prone to PMDD if you have:
Anxiety
or
depression

PMS.

Untreated PMDD can lead to depression and, in severe cases, suicide. The disorder can cause severe emotional distress and negatively affect relationships and careers.
If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts and live in the U.S., call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988
. This national network of local crisis centers provides 24/7 free and confidential support. You can also dial 988 if you’re worried about a loved one who may need help.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is PMDD diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will take a medical history and evaluate your symptoms. You may need to track your symptoms through one or two menstrual cycles. To diagnose PMDD, your provider will look for five or more PMDD symptoms, including one mood-related symptom. Your provider will rule out or diagnose other conditions such as anxiety, depression or reproductive disorders.
Management and Treatment
How is PMDD treated?
Your healthcare provider may recommend one or more of these treatments to help manage PMDD:
Antidepressants
called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) to help manage your brain’s serotonin levels. Examples of SSRIs include sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine HCI.
Hormonal
birth control
pills that have
drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol
.
Dietary changes
such as cutting back on certain foods and caffeine. Vitamins such as B-6 and magnesium may also reduce your symptoms.
Over-the-counter
pain medicines
to ease cramps (
dysmenorrhea
), headaches, breast tenderness and other physical symptoms.
Regular exercise
to improve mood.
Stress management
tools
, such as deep breathing exercises and
meditation
.
Can you cure PMDD naturally?
There are some ways to manage symptoms of PMDD that don’t involve medication. For example, you can practice yoga, try meditation or find other ways to improve your mood. Changing certain aspects of your diet may also bring relief. Additionally, support groups or resources may help you. Be sure to talk to your provider about all the treatment options available.

Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between PMS and PMDD?
PMDD and PMS are similar in that they both happen in the week or two before your period begins when your hormone levels drop. They both cause physical symptoms like cramps, headaches or bloating. However, PMDD also causes serious symptoms that may disrupt your mood.
What does a PMDD episode look like?
Symptoms of PMDD start 10 to 14 days before your period and usually go away within the first two days of your period. This means that a person with PMDD could feel the effects of PMDD for over two weeks each menstrual cycle. During this time, it’s important to follow your provider’s recommendations for treatment. Take extra care of yourself and lean on loved ones for support.
Is PMDD considered a mental illness?
PMDD is a mental health condition listed in the
DSM-5
as a "depressive disorder." The DSM-5 stands for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is a criteria for diagnosing mental health conditions.
Is PMDD a form of bipolar disorder?
No. PMDD and
bipolar disorder
aren’t the same condition. They do, however, have similar symptoms. During a depressive episode in bipolar disorder, you may feel irritable or like you’re losing control. You may also have suicidal thoughts. It’s important to get support and seek help if you have symptoms of either condition.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
PMDD is a serious disorder that can negatively affect your life, relationships and career. You may harm themselves or others. If you consistently experience severe depression and anxiety or other PMDD symptoms in the weeks leading up to your period, seek help from your healthcare provider. Medications can get hormone or serotonin levels in check so that you feel more like yourself. PMDD isn’t a problem you have to live with. Don’t put off getting the medical and mental health care you need.
