Eczema on Face
Eczema on your face is a condition that makes your skin itchy, dry and flaky. Eczema prevents your skin’s protective barrier from functioning as it should, which can make your skin sensitive to irritants and allergens. There’s no cure for eczema on your face, but treatment is available to help your symptoms go away.

What is eczema on your face?
Eczema on your face, or facial eczema, is a condition that can make the
skin
on your face dry, flaky and itchy.
Eczema
prevents your skin’s natural barrier from outside elements to function properly. This makes your skin sensitive, so it can easily react to irritants and allergens in your environment, which cause flares.

Irritants in your environment
: Whether you have allergies or not, there’s a lot in your environment that can cause skin irritation, including but not limited to, plants or animals, soaps and detergents, clothing fabrics, pollutants like smoke in the air and the humidity level.
An over-reactive immune system
: Your
immune system
helps your body fight foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses that can make you sick. If you have eczema, your immune system can mistake your skin cells, small irritants or allergens in your environment as foreign invaders and attacks them. This causes your skin to swell (inflammation) and become itchy.
Genetics
: Your
genes
are the building blocks of your body. A change to your DNA sequence (
genetic mutation
) can affect how proteins in your body maintain the barrier in your skin that protects you from your environment. You could be more at risk of developing facial eczema if you have a history of the condition in your biological family.
What triggers eczema on your face?
Each person diagnosed with eczema on their face has unique triggers that cause their symptoms to flare up. Some of the most common triggers for eczema could include:
Soaps and detergents.
Dry weather (low humidity).
Contact with an allergen.
Makeup.
Fabrics or clothing material.
Smoke and pollutants.
Stress
.
Is facial eczema contagious?

To diagnose eczema on your face, your provider will examine your skin to look for signs of eczema like patches of dry skin and skin discoloration. If your symptoms look similar to other skin conditions, your provider will offer tests to confirm a diagnosis, rule out other conditions or determine the cause of your symptoms. Tests could include:
A
patch test
to detect allergies in your environment.
A blood test or
culture swab test
to check for infections.
A
skin biopsy
to examine a small sample of your skin under a microscope.
Management and Treatment
How is eczema on your face treated?
Treatment for eczema on your face is unique to your skin and what caused your flare-up. Treatment could include:
Using gentle or sensitive skin moisturizers or lotions.
Applying anti-inflammatory medications (topical steroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors) to your skin.
Light therapy
to reduce the appearance of skin blemishes.
Taking medications like
antihistamines
,
corticosteroids
to reduce swelling and inflammation or
immunosuppressant
drugs to regulate the function of your immune system.
Before starting treatment with a new medication or drug, talk to your provider about the possible side effects, frequency and dosage of when you should take the medication to avoid interactions.

What moisturizers, creams or cleansers should I use for eczema on my face?
While there are multiple
types of moisturizers
available on the market, the kind of moisturizer, cream or cleanser that you choose can have an impact on how your skin heals or reacts.
Choose skin care products that:
Are fragrance-free and dye-free.
Are gentle or designed for sensitive skin.
Contain oils (petroleum jelly and mineral oil) or are greasy (ointments or creams).
Doesn’t include preservatives or stabilizers (skin irritants).
Improve your skin’s natural barrier (lipids and ceramides).
Every person has unique qualities to their skin that react differently to skincare products. The moisturizer that works best for you might not work for someone else. If you’re unsure about what type of moisturizer to use on your skin, talk to your healthcare provider.
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
After treatment for a flare of eczema symptoms, it could take several weeks before your skin clears up completely. Treatment from your provider or dermatologist helps your symptoms go away faster. You can prevent future flares by avoiding irritants and allergens that caused your symptoms and using a moisturizer on your skin regularly to rehydrate your skin.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have eczema on my face?
Eczema is a lifelong condition without a cure. Your symptoms can flare up on your face if you interact with environmental triggers like irritants and allergens. It takes several weeks before your symptoms go away, even with treatment.

Frequently apply unscented moisturizers designed to treat eczema to your skin throughout the day. The best times to apply moisturizer to your skin is in the morning when you wake up, every few hours to prevent dry skin throughout the day, after a bath or a shower when your skin is damp, and before you go to bed. Your provider might offer a medicated topical cream or ointment to treat your eczema during a flare.
Some people diagnosed with eczema on their face might experience low self-esteem, as their symptoms are visible on their skin when they enter social settings. It’s challenging to hide facial eczema because makeup can further irritate your skin and delay your healing time. If your eczema causes emotional distress or your symptoms get worse instead of better, contact your provider.
Will eczema on my face go away?
Yes, eczema on your face will go away, but it could take up to several weeks with treatment. Eczema is a chronic condition that can return to your face after it goes away. The best way to prevent a flare of eczema symptoms on your face is to avoid irritants and allergens and regularly moisturize your skin. If your eczema doesn’t seem to go away, talk to your provider about medication to treat your symptoms.
