What is purple crying?
Purple crying describes a developmental phase in which your baby cries uncontrollably for long periods of time. No matter what you do, nothing seems to soothe them. Persistent, high-pitched screaming can take its toll on parents. And the inability to console them can feel especially frustrating.

Every baby goes through this phase. Some may
cry
more, some less. But it’s a normal and healthy part of every infant’s development. It’s important to know why this happens and what you can do about it. Most of all, it’s important to know that the purple crying period will eventually end.
When does purple crying start and how long does it last?
Purple crying usually starts around 2 weeks of age and ends around 3 to 5 months of age.
What does purple crying mean?
Despite how it may sound, purple crying doesn’t mean your child is turning violet. The term “purple” is an acronym healthcare providers use to describe what’s happening during this phase of your baby’s development:
P
Peak of crying
Once this type of crying begins, your baby may cry more every week. This often peaks during the second month of life and tapers by the end of the fifth month.
U
Unexpected
Your baby may cry on and off for no apparent reason.
R
Resists soothing
Your baby might not stop crying no matter what soothing techniques you try.
P
Pain-like face
Your baby might look like they’re in pain even though they’re not.
L
Long-lasting
Crying can last for several hours a day. It’s not uncommon for babies in the purple crying period to cry for five hours a day or longer.
E
Evening
It’s common for babies in the purple crying period to cry more in the late afternoon and evening.

Purple crying vs. colic
Some people call it
colic
. Others refer to it as the “witching hour.” So, how is purple crying any different? The truth is all these terms describe the same thing.
Many
pediatricians
choose to call this phase of development “The Period of PURPLE Crying®.” The acronym “PURPLE” describes what you can expect from your baby during this stage. But most importantly, the word “period” serves as a reminder that the crying — though it may feel eternal — has a beginning and an end. Your baby will undoubtedly outgrow this phase.
Some experts avoid using the term “colic” because it sounds like an illness. There’s nothing wrong with a “colicky” baby. If your baby is growing strong and healthy but cries inconsolably every evening, they’re likely in their purple crying period.

Who coined the phrase “The Period of PURPLE Crying?”
“The Period of PURPLE Crying” is a term first introduced by Dr. Ronald G. Barr, a developmental pediatrician and expert on infant crying. Together with the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome (NCSBS), Dr. Barr developed a purple crying educational program to help prevent
shaken baby syndrome
, abusive head trauma and other forms of infant abuse.
How can I soothe my baby during the purple crying period?
The most important thing to know is that soothing doesn’t always work. There will be times when, no matter what you do, your baby will continue to cry.
That said, here are some things you can try:
Check your baby’s basic needs. (Are they tired? Hungry? Do they need a diaper change?)
Hold your baby with
skin-to-skin contact
.
Go for a walk.
Sing to them.
Give your baby a warm bath.
What if I can’t get my baby to stop crying?
When your baby continues to cry, even after you’ve tried everything, the best thing you can do is step away for a few minutes. Put your baby in a safe place and take some time to breathe.
It’s normal to feel frustrated and hopeless when your baby is inconsolable. But it’s important to keep your mental health in check and take good care when you feel yourself spiraling. It’s OK (and natural) to need a break. If possible, reach out to a trusted friend or family member for help and support.
Never shake your baby, no matter how frustrated you get. This can cause bleeding, bruising and swelling in your baby’s brain. Shaken baby syndrome can result in brain damage, permanent disabilities and even
death
. Most cases of shaken baby syndrome occur when parents or caregivers become frustrated by a baby’s persistent crying.
Understanding The Period of PURPLE Crying helps caregivers cope during this developmental phase and reminds them that it’s temporary. Purple crying education focuses on reducing the risk of infant abuse like shaken baby syndrome.
When should I call my baby’s pediatrician?
To keep your baby’s health in check, be sure to attend routine
pediatric wellness visits
. Your pediatrician will let you know how often to schedule these.
Persistent, inconsolable crying is normal between 2 weeks and 5 months of age. But you should call your pediatrician if your baby shows any of these additional symptoms:
Fever
of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher.
Cries more when you move, touch or hold them.
Vomiting
.
Refuses to eat or drink for more than eight hours.
Areas of swelling.
Looks or acts differently in any way.
Poor weight gain.
Changes in their poop.
If your baby is healthy and growing as expected, there’s probably no need to worry about persistent crying. Still, you should always call your pediatrician if you have concerns.
