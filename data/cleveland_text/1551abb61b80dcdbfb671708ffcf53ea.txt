Cognitive Test
Cognitive tests are short, quick tests to check how well your brain is functioning. These tests don’t diagnose specific diseases. Instead, they identify a problem with cognition and the need for more in-depth testing.

What is a cognitive test?
A cognitive test checks for problems with your mental functioning (cognition). The test involves answering basic questions and performing simple tasks. You don’t need to study before taking this test.

Cognition is your
brain’s
ability to process all the information it takes in from your senses. Cognition includes:
Attention skills
Decision-making skills
Judgment
Language
Learning
Reasoning
Remembering
Thinking
Understanding
This is also called a cognitive impairment test and a cognitive screening test.
Why might I need cognitive testing?
A healthcare provider may recommend a cognitive test if they suspect mental decline or
cognitive impairment
(issues with mental functioning). Some examples may include:
You forget where you put things or you forget important dates or appointments regularly
You have trouble finding the right words to say or forget what you are saying in the middle of a conversation
You feel frustrated because tasks that used to be easy are challenging for you to do
Even if there isn’t any suspicion of an underlying health condition that affects cognition, your provider may still perform a cognitive test after age 65. This is due to natural changes in how your brain works as your body ages.

Test Details
What does a cognitive test consist of?
A cognitive test consists of a few questions or tasks that you answer or perform to the best of your ability. This test doesn’t require you to research information (study) or prepare in any way. You’ll simply respond or follow the instructions that your provider gives you. It should only take a few minutes up to 15 minutes in total. It’s usually part of a regular health exam.

Where do I take this test?
You’ll take this test in a healthcare provider’s office. Depending on your needs, this may be done in a hospital setting, especially after an accident or
traumatic brain injury
.
What are the types of cognitive screening tests?
There are several types of cognitive tests. The three most common include:
A test where you memorize a short list of words, name objects shown in pictures, and copy a drawing of a shape and other similar tasks. It takes about 15 minutes to complete.
A test that involves counting, and identifying objects and other common, well-known facts. It takes about 10 minutes.
A test that involves memorizing and recalling a three-word list of unrelated words. You’ll also draw a picture of a common object. This test usually takes about three minutes.
Cognitive test sample questions
Cognitive screening tests check various brain functions that relate to cognition. Some examples of questions or tasks your provider may ask include:
Attention
. Recall the names of three unrelated objects.
Decision-making
. Listen to a scenario and describe what you’d do (for example, “You forgot your grocery list and you’re at the store, what do you do?”).
Judgment
. Listen to a situation and describe how you’d react (for example, “If you saw someone get an injury, what would you do?”).
Language
. Follow verbal directions (for example, “Place your right hand on your left knee.”).
Learning
. Spell a five-letter word forward and backward. Read a sentence out loud, write a sentence down and repeat phrases.
Reasoning
. Complete a simple math problem (for example, “What is 2+5?”).
Remembering
. Describe an event that happened recently (
short-term memory
) or a few years ago (
long-term memory
).
Thinking
. Name the relationship between objects (for example, “A cat and a dog are both animals.”).
Understanding
. Identify what day it is and the city you’re in.
What can I expect after the test?
Your provider will give you more information about how you did after the test. If any questions were challenging or you had trouble answering a few, that’s OK — you don’t need a perfect score. Your provider may recommend additional testing if the results are abnormal. They’ll let you know what your situation looks like, as it can vary from person to person.
What are the downsides of the cognitive ability test?
The word “test” may
stress
you out. So, it’s normal to feel a bit nervous before you see your provider. But this isn’t a typical diagnostic test or an exam you take in school. This type of test is quick and assesses your thinking abilities.
It requires follow-up testing to make a diagnosis, especially if your provider suspects
mild cognitive impairment
or
dementia
.
Results and Follow-Up
What do cognitive screening test results show?
Cognitive screening tests reveal if there’s a problem with mental functioning. However, the test can’t diagnose a specific disease, and it doesn’t reveal the severity, cause or location of impairment in your brain.
The test results come as a score that’s either normal or below normal. A normal score may mean you’re your brain is functioning as expected. But in some cases, you may still have symptoms of an underlying cognitive impairment with a normal score. Additional testing may be necessary.

A below-normal score means that your provider suspects cognitive impairment. They’ll recommend follow-up testing or recommend you see a
neurologist
. This is a provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect your brain. Your provider may order a
neuropsychological assessment
.
Additional Common Questions
Can I test my cognitive ability myself?
There are some cognitive tests that you or a loved one can take at home to give you an idea of what you can expect at a healthcare provider’s office. One such test is the
Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE)
. You can find it on the internet.
Like other cognitive tests, it assesses basic identification, language, reasoning, problem-solving and memory skills.
But remember, no cognitive test can diagnose
Alzheimer’s disease
, dementia or any other specific condition. But the tests can be a helpful screening tool for cognitive impairment.
Taking an at-home cognitive test is a reasonable first step if you think you or a loved one are having trouble with cognition.
After completing the test, make an appointment with a healthcare provider. They can:
Discuss the findings
Conduct a
physical exam
Review your medical and medication history
Order other tests to confirm or rule out conditions that affect memory or thinking

A note from Cleveland Clinic
You might feel intimidated by the word “test,” but there’s nothing to fear during a cognitive test. This is more of an evaluation that gives a healthcare provider more insight into how your brain works. It only takes a few minutes, and you should receive a score shortly after taking the test.
But knowing your score is only the start of the process. You’ll need additional testing to learn more. Your provider will explain your score and the next steps, if you need to take any. If you have any questions about the test or what you can expect following a cognitive test, your care team is here to help.
