Premature Atrial Contractions
A premature atrial contraction is an extra heartbeat that starts in one of your heart’s upper chambers (atria). It may feel like your heart skips a beat. Premature atrial contractions usually don’t need treatment. But you should contact a healthcare provider if your premature atrial contractions start happening more often.

Overview
An EKG reading may show abnormal results if you have premature atrial contractions (extra heartbeats) at the time.
What are premature atrial contractions?
Premature atrial contractions (PACs) are extra heartbeats that start in the upper
chambers
(or atria) of your
heart
.

Normally, your heart contracts in an organized manner. Electrical impulses (which tell your heart cells to contract) start in the right upper corner of the right atrium in a region called the sinus node. The sinus node fires electrical impulses in an organized and rhythmic manner, determining your
heart rate
. PACs occur when your upper chambers contract prematurely from an area different from the sinus node and briefly interrupt your heart’s normal rhythm.
When the premature, or early, signal tells your heart to contract, there may not be much
blood
in your heart at that moment. That means there’s not much blood to pump out. A pause and a strong beat may follow the extra heartbeat, making it feel like a skipped beat.
A premature atrial contraction can feel like an extra beat when there’s more blood in the heart to pump than there is with a skipped beat.
Premature atrial contractions, also called beats or complexes, are common in people of all ages. A premature atrial contraction can make you feel unsettled. But you usually don’t need to be concerned unless you have a lot of them.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of premature atrial contractions?
Premature atrial contraction symptoms may include heartbeats that:
Are pounding or feeling stronger than your regular heartbeats
Skip
Feel faster and out of rhythm from your regular heart rate (
palpitations
)

You may also have anxiety or
shortness of breath
. But you may not have any symptoms at all.
What causes premature atrial contractions?
Premature atrial contraction causes may include:
A change in the amount of blood going to your heart
Injury to your heart
A problem with your heart’s structure (like
coronary artery disease
or
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
)
An issue with the amount of
electrolytes
or minerals (like potassium or magnesium) in your body
Tiredness
Caffeine
intake
Intake of beverages containing alcohol
Tobacco product use
Stress
Certain medications, including some used for heart issues or mental health
Recreational drug use
Thyroid
problems
If PACs happen to you often, your healthcare provider will look for a cause. Often, the cause is unknown.
What are the risk factors for premature atrial contractions?
Anyone can get premature atrial contractions, but they’re more likely to happen frequently in people who:
Are taller
Are
pregnant
Have
cardiovascular disease
Aren’t physically active
Have low
HDL cholesterol
Have a
higher systolic blood pressure
Have
diabetes
Have
COPD
or other pulmonary diseases
Don’t
drink enough water
Smoke
Take in excessive caffeine or stimulants
Don’t get enough
restful sleep
Are very anxious or have high levels of stress
Have electrolyte abnormalities
Use recreational drugs
What are the complications of premature atrial contractions?
Frequent premature atrial contractions can lead to
atrial fibrillation (Afib)
.
Researchers define “frequent” PACs by different numbers. They can range from 76 to more than 500 premature atrial contractions in 24 hours, for example.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are premature atrial contractions diagnosed?
Usually, your
blood pressure
is normal with premature atrial contractions. It’s possible for a healthcare provider to miss premature atrial contractions during a
physical exam
. This is because they may not happen during the exam.
If you’re having premature atrial contractions, your provider may want to order:
Electrocardiogram
(EKG).
If your heart rhythm reading is normal, you may not need any other test.
Temporary
heart monitor
.
This device that you wear checks your heart rhythm for a day or two or even up to two weeks.
Echocardiogram
.
This ultrasound shows your heart’s structure.
Blood tests
.
These check your electrolyte levels and thyroid hormone levels.
Management and Treatment
How are premature atrial contractions treated?
Most of the time, you don’t need treatment for PACs. They usually go away on their own. But if your symptoms are bad or happen regularly, your healthcare provider can treat the cause.
Your provider may treat your premature atrial contractions with:
Medication; providers choose
beta-blockers
first, but sometimes, they prescribe
antiarrhythmics
Catheter ablation
(rare)

Complications/side effects of treatment
Beta-blockers can make you feel tired, dizzy or nauseated. Talk to your provider if your side effects don’t get better.
Different antiarrhythmic medications (like flecainide, procainamide and amiodarone, among others) can have several side effects and interact with other medications.
Catheter ablation carries risks like
blood clots
, bleeding or infection. But providers generally consider it a low-risk procedure. Complications rarely happen after the procedure. You can most likely return to work in a week.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have premature atrial contractions?
In most cases, you don’t need treatment and your outlook is good. But if you’re having premature atrial contractions often, you may be at risk of getting
atrial flutter
and atrial fibrillation (Afib).
Your outlook depends on what’s causing your premature atrial contractions. Your provider will look at the conditions you already have when considering your prognosis. For example, your situation is more serious if you have problems with your heart’s structure.
Prevention
How can I lower my risk?
You may be able to lower your risk of premature atrial contractions by:
Being physically active.
Managing your blood pressure.
Managing your
cholesterol
.
Not using tobacco products.
Getting enough sleep.
Drinking less caffeine.
Limiting your use of alcohol.
Managing your stress
.
Not using addictive substances.

How do I take care of myself?
You may be able to have fewer premature atrial contractions if you:
Get physical activity regularly.
Reduce your intake of alcohol and caffeine.
Stop using tobacco products.
Avoid
dehydration
and lack of sleep.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Usually, premature atrial contractions may go away by themselves and may recur during periods of stress or physical illness. Pay attention to whether you start having more PACs. You should make an appointment with a healthcare provider if your symptoms continue, get worse or happen with other symptoms.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
You may want to consider asking your provider:
Do you know what’s causing my premature atrial contractions?
Do you recommend treatment for me?
How often do I need check-ups?
Additional Common Questions
Are premature atrial contractions the same as atrial fibrillation?
No. Atrial fibrillation is a more serious heart rhythm issue with an irregular heartbeat.
Should I be concerned about premature atrial contractions in pregnancy?
No. Premature atrial contractions in
pregnancy
are common. They normally stop by themselves and don’t need treatment.
What’s the difference between premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions?
They start in different parts of your heart. Premature atrial contractions start in your atria (upper chambers).
Premature ventricular contractions
start in your ventricles (lower chambers).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Premature atrial contractions (PACs) may take you by surprise and make you feel uneasy. But they’re usually not a cause for concern. Check in with a healthcare provider if the number of PACs you have increases. Because premature atrial contractions can predict more dangerous heart conditions, be sure to go to all of your regular check-ups with your provider.
