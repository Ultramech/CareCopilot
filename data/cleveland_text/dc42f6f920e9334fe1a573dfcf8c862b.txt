Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen is a hormone therapy used to treat hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It can greatly reduce the risk of cancer recurrence (return) and invasive cancer. Some people take tamoxifen to lower the risk of developing breast cancer. The daily oral medication stops cancer cells from using estrogen and progesterone to grow and spread.

What is tamoxifen?
Tamoxifen (Nolvadex® or Soltamox®) is a drug that treats hormone receptor-positive (hormone-positive)
breast cancer
. (Hormone-positive breast cancer is a type of
cancer
that needs
estrogen
and/or
progesterone
to grow.) Healthcare providers also use tamoxifen to help prevent breast cancer in people over 35 who have a high risk of the disease. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tamoxifen in 1998, it has become one of the most widely used breast cancer treatments.

Additional Common Questions
Is tamoxifen worth the risk?
Often, the benefits of taking tamoxifen outweigh the risks. But it depends on your specific situation. While the drug can successfully prevent breast cancer for many, it can also increase the risk of stroke, uterine cancer or blood clotting issues in others.
One research study tested the risks vs. benefits of tamoxifen in a group of 788 women. All of the participants were on tamoxifen and none of them had a history of breast cancer. The study found that the benefits of tamoxifen outweighed the risks for 74% of their participants, but not for 20% of their participants.
During a consultation, a healthcare provider will discuss your medical history in detail. To determine if this type of therapy is right for you, your provider will take the following into consideration:
Age.
Race.
Breast cancer risk.
Risk for tamoxifen adverse effects (stroke, cataracts, uterine cancer, etc.).
Is it safe to take tamoxifen during pregnancy?
Tamoxifen may cause
birth defects
. You shouldn’t take the medication if you’re
pregnant
or planning to become pregnant. To prevent pregnancy, talk to your healthcare provider about nonhormonal
birth control options
. (Hormonal contraceptives can fuel the growth of hormone-positive breast cancer.) You’ll need to use contraception while taking tamoxifen and for two months after you stop the medication.

Is tamoxifen chemotherapy?
No, tamoxifen is a type of hormonal therapy. It belongs to a class of drugs called
selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
.
Sometimes, healthcare providers refer to tamoxifen as “chemoprevention.” But usually, chemoprevention drugs aren’t the same as chemotherapy drugs.
Do tamoxifen side effects start immediately?
While it depends on the person, many individuals report side effects as soon as the first dose.
What things should I avoid while I’m taking tamoxifen?
Certain foods and beverages can make tamoxifen less effective, including:
Grapefruit.
Tangerines.
Beverages containing alcohol.
If you’re taking tamoxifen, you should avoid the foods and beverages listed above.
How long does tamoxifen stay in your body after stopping?
Tamoxifen stays active for up to two weeks after your last dose. However, it can take about three months to flush out of your system completely.
