ifosfamide
.
Occupation exposure to certain chemicals, such as aniline and toluidine.
Radiation therapy
near the bladder.

Your healthcare provider may order tests to make a diagnosis:
Urine tests to look for microscopic blood cells, cancer cells or infection.
Blood tests to look for infection or other conditions.
Imaging tests to take pictures of your bladder, such as
CT scan
,
MRI
or
ultrasound
.
Cystoscopy
, a test that uses a thin tool containing a light and camera to look into your bladder.
Your healthcare provider may assign a grade to hemorrhagic cystitis based on your symptoms and test results. The grade indicates how advanced or severe it is:
Grade I
: Minor bleeding that’s visible only under a microscope.
Grade II
: Visible but relatively minor bleeding.
Grade III
: Bleeding with small clots.
Grade IV
: Severe hemorrhagic cystitis that causes clots large enough to block urine flow.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat hemorrhagic cystitis?
Prompt treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis is important to reduce pain and prevent long-lasting bladder damage.
Treatment options vary widely, depending on the cause and severity of each case. Hemorrhagic cystitis treatment may include:
Bladder drainage through a catheter (tube) into a bag outside your body.
Changes to medications, such as an alternative chemotherapy or a lower dose.
Clot evacuation via catheter or cystoscopy to remove clots from your bladder.
Continuous bladder irrigation
, which injects fluids into your bladder to flush it out.
Embolization, which blocks bleeding blood vessels.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
.
Intravesical therapy, injection of medications into your bladder, such as sodium hyaluronidase and
aminocaproic acid
.
IV fluids
injected into a vein in your hand or arm to increase urine and flush the bladder.
Medications for infections, such as
antibiotics
to treat bacterial infections or
antivirals
to fight viruses.
Rarely do people with hemorrhagic cystitis require
blood transfusion
to replace heavy blood loss or a
cystectomy
(surgery to remove your bladder).

Outlook / Prognosis
Is hemorrhagic cystitis fatal?
The outlook depends on the cause and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis. The condition usually responds well to treatment and doesn’t lead to long-term problems, especially infection-related cases. Rarely, severe cases can be fatal.
Most people with cancer who develop hemorrhagic cystitis can continue cancer treatment.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Hemorrhagic cystitis occurs when your urinary bladder lining becomes inflamed and bleeds.
