Is dermatographia an autoimmune disease?
Dermatographia may be an autoimmune disease. Healthcare providers and medical researchers think it might be an inappropriate response from your
immune system
. Your immune system registers scratching or pressure as an allergen. It sends the chemical histamine to the area to remove the allergen from your body.
Is dermatographia contagious?
No, dermatographia isn’t contagious. You can’t spread dermatographia to another person through skin-to-skin contact.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is dermatographia diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider can diagnose dermatographia by agitating your skin. They’ll use a tongue depressor to scratch or press on the skin of your arm or back.
Dermatographia appears within five to seven minutes of agitation. The marks appear in the same direction and orientation as the agitation. It may look like someone wrote on your skin with a pen.
Management and Treatment
How do you get rid of dermatographia?
Symptoms of dermatographia are generally mild. They usually go away within 30 minutes.
If your dermatographia is more severe and lasts longer than 30 minutes, treatment options include:
Over-the-counter
antihistamine
capsules that you swallow with water.
Prescription cromolyn, which helps block allergic reactions.
Moisturizers that you apply to your affected areas.
Severe dermatographia that doesn’t respond to the above therapies may be treated with a prescription biologic therapy, which is injected.
Decreasing your stress can also help you get rid of dermatographia. Relaxation activities such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, breathing exercises and muscle relaxation can help decrease your stress and prevent dermatographia.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have dermatographia?
Generally, dermatographia leaves no lasting marks, causing only minor, short-lived irritation and symptoms. The condition may last anywhere from months to years, or you may have it throughout your life.
There isn’t a cure, but for many, dermatographia goes away on its own in a year or two. Or it may grow milder over time so you don’t experience major symptoms.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of developing dermatographia?
The following can help reduce your risk of developing dermatographia:
Avoid rubbing or scratching your skin.
Wear loose clothing made from smooth materials that wick away moisture.
Avoid itchy clothing, such as wool.
Use a mild soap for your bath or shower, and pat your skin dry instead of rubbing it.
Apply a moisturizing cream or ointment immediately after drying your skin to help seal in the moisture.
Take baths or showers with lukewarm water, not hot water.
Use a humidifier.
Learn to recognize stress in your life and how to manage it.
