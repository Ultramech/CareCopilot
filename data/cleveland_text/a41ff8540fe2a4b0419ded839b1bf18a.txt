Candida
yeast can be part of your gut microbiome. It’s normal to have small amounts in your body, including your esophagus. But the fungus could grow uncontrollably if a disease or medical treatment weakens your immune system.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of esophageal candidiasis
Esophageal candidiasis symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain
Chest pain
Heartburn
Nausea and vomiting
Pain when you swallow
and/or
difficulty swallowing
Oral thrush with occasional loss of taste
Esophageal candidiasis causes
This condition happens when something weakens your immune system. In this case, you may have topical immunity, meaning it only affects your esophagus. This can happen if you use certain medications, like inhaled corticosteroids.
Conditions like HIV, cancer and diabetes may impact your general immunity, meaning they weaken your entire immune system. Medical treatments like chemotherapy can affect your immune system. It may also happen if you’re in the hospital and you receive lots of antibiotics.
Other issues may increase your risk, including:
Being 65 and older
Having malnutrition
Receiving radiation therapy as treatment for conditions that affect your head and neck
Using tobacco, especially smoking cigarettes
Complications of esophageal candidiasis
This condition rarely causes complications. But you could have severe sores in your esophagus that lead to issues like:

Internal bleeding in your esophagus or stomach
Candidemia, when the infection gets into your bloodstream
Malnourishment
Narrowing of your esophagus
Sepsis
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
A healthcare provider will do a physical exam. They’ll ask if you have a condition or use medications that may weaken your immune system. Then, they’ll do an
upper endoscopy
to look at your esophagus. They’ll look for signs of the fungus that causes esophageal candidiasis. They may take tissue samples as part of an upper endoscopy.
Management and Treatment
How is esophageal candidiasis treated?
The most common treatment is the antifungal drug
fluconazole
. You’ll take this drug for 14 to 21 days or longer as needed. Other oral and systemic treatment options are available.
Your healthcare provider will also treat the condition that affects your immune system to reduce the chance that esophageal candidiasis will come back.
When should I seek care?
Esophageal candidiasis typically affects people with weak immune systems. If that’s your situation, you should talk to a healthcare provider if you have symptoms like pain when you try to swallow food or liquids. Having heartburn, nausea and vomiting are other symptoms of issues with your gastrointestinal tract, and a reason to contact a provider.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have esophageal candidiasis?
Medication to control the fungus usually cures this condition. But it can come back if you have underlying medical conditions or other risk factors that lead to esophageal candidiasis.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s normal to have some
Candida albicans
in your esophagus. But that little bit of fungus can become a big problem if something affects your immune system. In that case, the fungus may grow uncontrollably and cause esophageal candidiasis. Without treatment, this condition can last a long time. Rarely, esophageal candidiasis causes serious complications, like infections that affect your whole body. It can damage your esophagus, too.
If your immune system is weak, it’s important to tell your healthcare provider about new symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of esophageal candidiasis often cures the condition.
