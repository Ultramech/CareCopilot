Dissolving Lip Filler
Dissolving lip filler can reduce the effects of dermal lip fillers made of hyaluronic acid. This will make your lips return to the way they looked before you got lip fillers. This procedure might be right for you if you got lip fillers and had complications or if you dislike your results. A dissolving lip filler is a safe and effective option.

What makes a lip filler dissolve?
Healthcare providers use an enzyme substance called
hyaluronidase
to dissolve lip fillers. This substance breaks down hyaluronic acid filler only.
Do all lip fillers dissolve?
Not all lip fillers are dissolvable. Healthcare providers can dissolve fillers that contain
hyaluronic acid
. Hyaluronic-based fillers are the most common type of filler. However, if your filler contains silicone or other substances, you can’t dissolve it.
Does hyaluronidase dissolve other types of fillers?
If you have a filler that contains hyaluronic acid, hyaluronidase can dissolve it regardless of where the filler was placed. For example, hyaluronidase can dissolve hyaluronic acid filler in your cheeks, lips and lower eyelids, among other areas. Other types of filler material don’t dissolve with hyaluronidase.
Where does lip filler go when it dissolves?
Your body will naturally get rid of lip filler material after it dissolves. It won’t stay within your body.
Who is a good candidate for dissolving lip filler?
If you previously got a lip filler injection, you may decide on dissolving the lip filler if you:
Experience an infection.
Have bumps at the injection site.
Have uneven lips or unnatural-looking volume.
Don’t like the size, shape or look of your lips.
Treatment Details
How do I prepare for treatment to have my lip filler dissolved?
A healthcare provider will give you instructions on how you can prepare before treatment to dissolve a lip filler. An example might include avoiding medications or
supplements
that may increase bleeding and interfere with your healing, like
aspirin
and
fish oil
. In addition, you should
stop smoking
several weeks before dissolving lip filler because it can disrupt your healing process.

What happens before a dissolving lip filler procedure?
Before dissolving your lip filler, your healthcare provider will ask you if you are allergic to bee venom. If you had an allergic reaction to a
bee sting
in the past, you’re not able to have hyaluronidase injections as there’s a risk for a severe allergic reaction called
anaphylaxis
.
What happens during a dissolving lip filler procedure?
A healthcare provider may apply a numbing cream to your lips to minimize discomfort before your procedure. They’ll inject hyaluronidase into your lips with a thin needle. The hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid, which is the material that makes up your lip filler.
The entire treatment to dissolve your lip filler may take between 10 and 15 minutes.
What happens after a dissolving lip filler procedure?
After your procedure, you may experience some swelling, bruising, tenderness and other minor side effects. Usually, these side effects go away on their own within a few days. In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend
corticosteroids
or
antihistamines
to help with the swelling and other side effects.
How long does it take for a lip filler to dissolve?
Healthcare providers can usually dissolve lip filler in one to two visits. For instances of large amounts of filler or nodules, it may take more than one session. You may notice some results immediately, but it can take up to two weeks to see the full results.
Can I partially dissolve lip filler?
Sometimes, you may only want to dissolve one area of lip filler. If you have a lump on your lips or an area you don’t like, it’s possible to partially dissolve lip filler. Typically, healthcare providers use a smaller amount of hyaluronidase to do this.
Does getting lip filler dissolved hurt?
As with any injection, there may be some discomfort associated with it. Your healthcare provider may apply a numbing cream to your lips to minimize mild pain.
Can I dissolve lip filler at home?
No, you can’t dissolve a lip filler at home. A licensed healthcare provider is the only one who can inject hyaluronidase to dissolve a lip filler.
