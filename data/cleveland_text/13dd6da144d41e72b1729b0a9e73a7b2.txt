“Sulfa” is short for sulfonamides, a class of drugs that consists mostly of antibiotics. It’s also contained in other medications.
Antibiotics
are medications you take for
bacterial infections
. Sulfa drugs work by preventing bacteria from producing a substance they need to grow and multiply. Sulfonamides can be taken orally (by mouth) or applied directly to your skin or eyes (topical).
Once you know you have an allergy to sulfa, avoiding medications containing sulfa is the best treatment. You should always let your healthcare providers know about any drug allergies you have so they can put a note in your medical history.

Diagnosis and Tests
How do I know if I have a sulfa allergy?
Healthcare providers don’t typically use tests to diagnose a sulfa allergy. Instead, your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your medication use and review your symptoms to see if a sulfa allergy is the cause of your allergic reaction.
It’s possible to test for sulfa sensitivity by taking sulfa medication under medical supervision to see if it triggers a reaction. This is called an oral drug challenge test. But many providers don’t want to take the chance because this might trigger a severe reaction.
If your provider finds that you have a sulfa allergy, they may need to find an alternative medication to treat your condition. If you have to take a sulfa medication, your healthcare provider may recommend desensitization therapy. This is a way to gradually build your tolerance for a medication to reduce the severity of your reaction. While it allows you to take sulfa for a short time, it doesn’t cure you or make you not allergic.
Management and Treatment
How is a sulfa allergy treated?
Avoiding medications containing sulfa is the best treatment. As you won’t learn you have a drug allergy until after you’ve taken it, it’s impossible to know ahead of time how your body will react to a medication.
For mild allergic reactions, your healthcare provider may recommend taking
antihistamines
or
corticosteroids
until symptoms subside. More severe reactions may require an
epinephrine injection
(EpiPen®).

While most people have mild to moderate reactions to a sulfa allergy, some people can experience life-threatening symptoms like difficulty breathing and painful blisters on their skin, mouth or genitals. These symptoms require immediate attention in an emergency room.
Are there other drugs I should avoid?
Let your healthcare provider know if you experience a reaction to sulfonamides or any other medications. There may be other drugs they want you to avoid taking.

Prevention
Can you prevent a drug allergy?
No, there isn’t a way to prevent a drug allergy. You can only avoid the drug in the future. Your healthcare provider and pharmacy should be aware of any drug allergies you have. Some people wear a medical bracelet or carry a card in their wallet or on their phone that states they have a sulfa allergy. This can be helpful in the event you experience an emergency and can’t communicate.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
A sulfa allergy occurs when you have an allergic reaction to sulfonamides, which are in drugs to treat bacterial infections. The most common symptoms of a sulfa allergy are hives, skin rash, itchy skin and sensitivity to sunlight. If you experience any of these symptoms after taking medication for an infection, let your healthcare provider know. There should be alternative antibiotics you can take that won’t give you symptoms. While it may be scary to have an allergy to medication, telling all of your healthcare providers about it is the best way to protect yourself from another allergic reaction.
