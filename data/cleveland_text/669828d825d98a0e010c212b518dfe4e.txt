Cervical Dysplasia
Cervical dysplasia is a precancerous condition. An HPV infection causes it. Without treatment, cervical dysplasia can lead to cervical cancer. Early detection and treatment can prevent these abnormal cells from becoming cancerous.

What Is Cervical Dysplasia?
Healthcare providers classify the severity of cervical dysplasia (CIN) based on how much of the tissue looks abnormal under a microscope.
Cervical dysplasia is a precancerous condition in which abnormal cells grow on the surface of your
cervix
. Your cervix is attached to the top of your vagina. It’s at the opening of your uterus.

Hearing the word “precancerous” can be scary. But most
women
with cervical dysplasia don’t develop
cervical cancer
. Receiving a cervical dysplasia diagnosis means that you
might
— not that you
will
— develop cervical cancer. Careful monitoring and treatments often prevent this. That’s why it’s important to see your
gynecologist
regularly for screenings.
Another name for cervical dysplasia is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). “Intraepithelial” means the abnormal cells are on the surface
(epithelium
) of your cervix. They haven’t grown past that surface layer. “Neoplasia” means abnormal cell growth.
CIN stages
Healthcare providers classify the severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) based on how much of the tissue looks abnormal under a microscope:
CIN 1:
Abnormal cells affect about one-third of the thickness of the epithelium.
CIN 2:
Abnormal cells affect about one-third to two-thirds of the epithelium.
CIN 3:
Abnormal cells affect more than two-thirds of the epithelium.
CIN 1 rarely becomes cancer and often goes away on its own. CIN 2 and 3 are more likely to require treatment to prevent cancer. About 100,000 women receive treatment for cervical dysplasia each year in the U.S.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of cervical dysplasia
Cervical dysplasia doesn’t usually cause symptoms. But some women may have irregular
vaginal bleeding
or spotting after intercourse.
Most women who have cervical dysplasia find out they have it after a routine
Pap smear
.
Cervical dysplasia causes
A virus called
HPV (human papillomavirus)
causes cervical dysplasia. HPV is the most common viral
sexually transmitted infection
(STI) in the U.S.
If you have cervical dysplasia, you have HPV. Some women have HPV but don’t develop cervical dysplasia.
Over 100 strains of HPV exist. In many cases, your
immune system
will get rid of the
virus
. But some strains, like HPV-16 and HPV-18, are more likely to cause cervical dysplasia.
Risk factors
Researchers don’t know why some women with HPV develop cervical dysplasia while others don’t.
Risk factors include:
Smoking cigarettes
.
Smoking and using products that contain tobacco can double your risk of cervical dysplasia.
Having a
weakened immune system
.
This makes it harder for your body to fight an HPV infection.
The strain of HPV and how long you’ve had the untreated infection may also play roles in developing cervical dysplasia.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Your healthcare provider may notice signs of cervical dysplasia during a routine internal exam. They may do a test called a Pap smear. This is when your provider collects a sample of cervical cells that a pathologist can look at under a microscope. If the
Pap smear reveals abnormal cells
, you may need a:
Colposcopy
:
Your provider performs and internal exam with a lighted instrument to check for abnormal cells in your cervix or vaginal walls.
Biopsy
:
Your provider removes tissue samples that a
pathologist
examines in a laboratory.
Your healthcare provider will go over the results with you. Together, you’ll determine the next steps for treatment.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for cervical dysplasia?
Treatment depends on various factors like:
The severity of cervical dysplasia.
Your age and overall health.
Your treatment preferences.
Procedures to treat cervical dysplasia can impact
pregnancy
. Your healthcare provider will go over your options if you’re pregnant or plan to become pregnant.
CIN 1 treatment
With low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1), you likely won’t need treatment. Most of these cases go away on their own. Only about 1% of CIN 1 cases eventually progress to cervical cancer.
Your healthcare provider may recommend periodic Pap smears to watch for any worsening changes in abnormal cells.
CIN 2 and CIN 3 treatment
If the cervical dysplasia is more severe (CIN 2 or CIN 3), your provider may recommend removing or destroying the abnormal cells. These procedures
cure
cervical dysplasia in about 90% of all cases.
The procedures include:
Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)
:
Your provider uses a small, electrically charged wire loop to remove tissue.
Cold knife
cone biopsy (conization)
:
Your provider removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue containing the abnormal cells.
Hysterectomy
:
Your provider surgically removes your uterus and cervix. This may be an option if cervical dysplasia persists or doesn’t improve after other procedures.

Each of these procedures has risks and potential complications. You and your provider will discuss which option is best for you.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Your healthcare provider will want to check the health of your cervix over time. They’ll want to make sure abnormal cells don’t grow back or become cancerous.
Following treatment, they may recommend that you have a follow-up Pap smear every three to six months for one to two years. Afterward, you may resume having yearly Pap smears.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
The outlook for cervical dysplasia with early diagnosis is excellent. Removing or destroying the abnormal cells significantly reduces your risk of cervical cancer. But these procedures come with certain side effects, like potential issues with pregnancy.
Prevention
How can I prevent cervical dysplasia?
The only way to prevent cervical dysplasia is to avoid getting HPV. Prevention steps include:
The HPV vaccine
:
The HPV vaccine prevents HPV infections that can progress to cervical cancer or
genital warts
. It can’t treat pre-existing HPV or cervical dysplasia. But it may prevent infections from returning in some cases.
Abstinence or
safer sex
:
You can prevent HPV infections by avoiding sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. You can also reduce your risk by practicing safer sex with condoms.
Regular Pap smears:
Early detection can help prevent severe cervical dysplasia. You should have your first Pap smear at age 21. If your Pap smears remain normal, your provider might recommend repeat tests every three years until age 29. You should have co-testing (Pap Smear with HPV testing) every five years if you’re between the ages of 30 and 65. Testing can’t prevent cervical dysplasia, but it can help with early detection.
Don’t smoke or use tobacco products:
There’s a greater chance that an HPV infection could become cervical dysplasia if you smoke or use tobacco.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Learning that you have precancerous cells on your cervix is stressful. But cervical dysplasia (CIN) doesn’t always lead to cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent cervical cancer from ever forming. Your healthcare provider will be by your side to answer any questions. Together, you’ll decide on a treatment plan that’s best for you.
