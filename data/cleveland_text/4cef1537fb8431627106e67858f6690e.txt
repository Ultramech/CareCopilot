Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between an ophthalmologist and an optometrist?
Ophthalmologists and optometrists and are both eye care specialists.
Ophthalmologists
are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathy (DO) who have attended medical school. They’re qualified to diagnose and treat any condition that can affect your eyes and vision. They can also perform eye surgery.
Optometrists are doctors of optometry (OD). They can diagnose and treat many issues, but they don’t perform surgery on your eyes. Your optometrist might refer you to an ophthalmologist if they identify an issue in your eyes that requires surgery.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
An ophthalmologist is an eye doctor who can help you manage every part of your eye health. They can do all your routine eye exams and correct common vision issues, but they can also perform eye surgery for more complex issues.
Some people visit an ophthalmologist for all their regular eye care — others only see one when they need surgery or specialized care. No matter when you see an ophthalmologist, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Your ophthalmologist will make sure you understand every test, result and treatment you’ll need.
