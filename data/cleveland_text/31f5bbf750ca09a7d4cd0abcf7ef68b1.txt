Vitamin F
Vitamin F is comprised of two types of essential fatty acids — alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA). These are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which can be found in many plant-based food sources such as oils, nuts and seeds. Your body needs vitamin F to function properly, and studies have shown it may have many other benefits.

What is vitamin F?
Vitamin F isn’t actually a vitamin. It’s made up of two kinds of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA). ALA is an
omega-3 fatty acid
, and LA is an omega-6 fatty acid. Scientists discovered ALA and LA in the 1920s and mistook them for a vitamin they called vitamin F. The label stuck even though they were later found to be fats.

ALA and LA are essential fatty acids, which means you need them to survive. They play an important role in keeping your body running smoothly. Your body doesn’t produce all of the ALA and LA it needs to function properly. You need to get most of these fatty acids from your diet.

If you’re not getting enough vitamin F in your diet, supplements are available. Vitamin F can help with brain development and can help reduce your risk of chronic conditions. Before taking a supplement, ask your healthcare provider if they think you should add it to your daily routine.
