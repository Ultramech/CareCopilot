Hymenal Tag

Your hymen is a small, thin piece of tissue at the opening of your
vagina
. The size, shape and thickness of your hymen are unique to you and can change over time.
Your baby may be born with a hymenal tag. Tags can also appear later in life after your hymen tears or after
vaginal childbirth
. A hymenal tag may look darker or lighter than the surrounding skin, but it will usually blend in. It’s usually very small, so it may be difficult to see.
Your hymen tearing is a normal part of your development. It can happen with physical activity, tampon use or intercourse (sex).
Hymenal tags typically don’t cause health problems. But they can cause discomfort. In some cases, a healthcare provider may recommend surgically removing it.
Symptoms and Causes
Hymenal tag symptoms
You may not realize you have a hymenal tag. But some people feel discomfort or irritation. This can happen:
During sex, especially with penetration
When you insert a
tampon
When your underwear rubs against it
When you
masturbate
The tag may sometimes swell or become discolored.
Talk to a healthcare provider if you feel irritation or pain around your vaginal opening. They’ll want to check the area for any signs of problems.
Hymenal tag causes
A hymenal tag can develop in a few ways:
You’re born with it
. Healthcare providers consider this a harmless difference in how a baby’s hymen forms during
fetal development
. They don’t know why it happens.
It develops after your hymen tears
. There may be a bit of tissue that doesn’t go back (recede) into your vagina after it tears.
You have a vaginal delivery
.
If you give birth vaginally, there’s a chance you can develop a hymenal skin tag from pushing during
labor
. But sometimes, a hymenal tag goes away after vaginal birth.

Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Talk to a healthcare provider if you think you have a hymenal tag. They can diagnose it with an exam of the area.
In addition to a visual exam, they may do a
pelvic exam
or
Pap test
to rule out other conditions. In rare cases, they may take a
biopsy
.
Management and Treatment
How is a hymenal tag treated?
You may only need treatment for a hymenal tag if it’s causing discomfort or irritation. If this is the case, a healthcare provider can remove the skin tag with surgical scissors or a scalpel. It’s a simple procedure they can do in their office.
Never attempt to remove a hymenal tag on your own.
Will it go away?
Yes, some hymenal tags go away on their own. This often happens for hymenal tags that are present at birth. Most of these tags go away by the time your child is 3 years old.

Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between a hymenal polyp and a hymenal tag?
Hymenal polyps are small growths in your baby’s hymen that are present at birth. They look like small stalks. Hymenal tags are pieces of extra tissue that shoot off from your hymen.
Hymenal polyps often disappear a few weeks after birth. They typically don’t cause any health problems. But they may cause bleeding or spotting if they tear. Almost all hymenal polyps are benign (not cancerous).
If you think you have a hymenal polyp, it’s important that you follow up with a healthcare provider to be sure, even if it’s not bothersome.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Feeling a lump or bump “down there” may be concerning. But a hymenal tag is usually not a cause for worry. Still, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider about it, especially if it’s causing discomfort. They can diagnose it and discuss treatment options with you.
