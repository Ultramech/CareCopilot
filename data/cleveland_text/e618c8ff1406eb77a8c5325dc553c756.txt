They’re synthetic (human-made) drugs that are similar to
cortisol
, a
hormone
your body naturally produces. Usually, your
adrenal glands
produce and release cortisol. Corticosteroids have a similar anti-inflammatory effect throughout your body, but in a way your provider can change and adjust to fit your needs.
Providers use corticosteroids to treat lots of health conditions, especially
autoimmune diseases
. Some of the most common conditions providers treat with corticosteroids include:
Lupus
.
Inflammatory arthritis (especially
rheumatoid arthritis
).
Asthma
.
Vasculitis
.
Eczema
and other skin conditions.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
.
Myositis
.
Allergic reactions or life-threatening
anaphylaxis
.
You may also need a steroid to help your body heal after an injury, including:
Bursitis
.
Trigger finger and trigger thumb
.
Tendinitis
.
What is the difference between steroids, corticosteroids and glucocorticoids?
Providers might refer to corticosteroids as glucocorticoids or the shortened term steroids. All of these names mean any synthetic medications that reduce inflammation in your body.
Scientifically, glucocorticoids are a specific subgroup of corticosteroids. But they’re commonly used as interchangeable names for the same kinds of drugs. Your provider will suggest the right medication for you, no matter what they call it.

All the different names for anti-inflammatory steroids aren’t the same as the
anabolic steroids
some athletes use to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Anabolic steroids are synthetic forms of
testosterone
.
Examples of corticosteroids and glucocorticoids
Some of the most common types of corticosteroids and glucocorticoids include:
Prednisone.
Cortisone.
Hydrocortisone.
Methylprednisolone.
What do corticosteroids do in the body?
Corticosteroids are strong, fast-acting anti-inflammatory medications. They can have several effects on your body, including:
Reducing inflammation.
Relieving pain.
Calming (suppressing) your immune system.
Inflammation
(swelling) usually happens when your
immune system
sends cells to fight infections or heal an injury. Health conditions can make your immune system go into overdrive. This can lead to inflammation causing more problems than it helps. Steroids make your body slow down the production of the chemicals that cause inflammation.
How are corticosteroids given?
There are lots of different ways your provider might give you a steroid. They might apply it locally, which means a targeted dose to an exact location in or on your body. You might also take glucocorticoids systemically, which means in a way that spreads them throughout your whole body. Local steroids are more common because they have a lower side effect risk.
Local corticosteroid treatments include:
Joint injections.
Eye drops.
Ear drops.
Topical creams you rub on your skin.
Systemic steroids include:
Oral medications you take by mouth.
Intravenous (IV) steroids a provider infuses or injects into a vein.
Intramuscular (IM) injections into a
muscle
.
Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of corticosteroids?
Corticosteroids are one of the fastest ways to reduce inflammation in your body. Depending on which type of medication you need and how you take it, you’ll notice a reduction in pain, swelling, discoloration and other symptoms very quickly. Some glucocorticoids take a few days to take effect, but they’re still one of the fastest ways to treat severe symptoms.
Steroids can also offer long-lasting pain relief. For example,
cortisone shots
can manage symptoms for months, or even permanently.
Corticosteroids can sometimes be lifesaving, too. For example, steroids may prevent the kind of worsening of kidney inflammation that can cause
kidney failure
in people who have autoimmune diseases like lupus or vasculitis. They may help those people avoid needing
kidney dialysis
or a
transplant
.
What are common corticosteroid side effects?
Corticosteroids are a safe, effective way to manage temporary and long-term (chronic) conditions. Like all medications, they can have side effects. Some of the most common corticosteroid side effects include:

An increased appetite.
Unexpected weight gain.
Skin changes, including
bruising
more easily than usual and increased
acne
.
Retaining water, which makes your skin and face look swollen or puffy.
Stomach irritation.
Muscle weakness.
Mood swings
, including increased
anxiety
, restlessness or trouble sleeping.
Increased body hair.
Are corticosteroids harmful?
Like all medications, corticosteroids can cause side effects, some of which are harmful. There’s no way to guarantee you’ll avoid side effects or complications, but using corticosteroids exactly as your healthcare provider prescribes them is the best way to reduce your risk.
The chances you experience side effects goes up the longer you take them, especially if you use them for a long time. Your provider will help you understand the risks and benefits before you start any new medication.
Corticosteroids can increase your risk of developing some conditions (or worsen them if you already have them), including:
Cushing syndrome
.
Diabetes
.
High blood pressure
.
Osteoporosis
.
Infections.
Corticosteroids raise your blood sugar levels. People with diabetes should check their blood sugar level more often for around five days after starting a new steroid.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Visit your healthcare provider if you’re still experiencing symptoms like inflammation and pain a week after starting a new corticosteroid. Ask your provider how soon the medication should start relieving your symptoms.

Tell your provider right away if you experience any of the following symptoms:
Fever
.
Nausea
or
vomiting
.
Trouble concentrating or thinking clearly.
Dizziness
.
Ask your provider how often you should check your blood sugar, blood pressure or bone density if you need steroids for more than a few months. Your provider will suggest tests that can screen you for serious complications before they happen.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It might be overwhelming to read the list of corticosteroid side effects. There are so many different types, ways to take them and issues they can cause. Is it really worth it? For many people, the answer is definitely yes. They’re one of the most common medications to treat inflammation, pain and other symptoms that lots of conditions cause.
It’s perfectly normal to be worried or have questions before starting any medication. Don’t be afraid to ask your provider each and every question that comes to mind. They’ll help you understand all the benefits, potential risks and everything else you need to know before you start a corticosteroid.
