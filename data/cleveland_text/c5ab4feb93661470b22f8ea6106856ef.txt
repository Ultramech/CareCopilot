Tooth Loss
Tooth loss can happen because of gum disease, tooth decay or trauma. Replacing teeth you’ve lost can reduce your risk for future oral health issues like bone loss, shifting teeth and further tooth loss. Treatments include dental implants, bridges and dentures.

Overview
What is tooth loss?
Tooth loss is a rite of passage during
childhood
. But if you’re an adult, it’s a warning sign that something else is going on. Cavities, gum disease and trauma can cause it.

Losing a permanent (adult) tooth is like pushing over the first domino. Once it happens, it can lead to other oral health issues like bone loss, shifting teeth or
jaw pain
. Unless you treat tooth loss, it can lead to more
teeth
falling out in the future. You can stop this cycle with regular dental visits and good
oral hygiene
at home.
How common is tooth loss?
Around 178 million adults in the U.S. have lost at least one tooth. Around 40 million adults have lost all their teeth.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of tooth loss?
Losing a tooth might come as a surprise, but you’ll know it when it happens. Here are some warning signs that might tell you when you’re about to lose a tooth:
Bad breath
.
Bleeding gums
.
Loose tooth
.
Swollen gums
.
Toothache
.
Tell your dentist whenever you notice these signs and symptoms. Early treatment may save your tooth.
What causes tooth loss?
Gum disease
is the leading cause of tooth loss among adults. Other causes include:
Cavities
.
Dental trauma
, like an accident or injury.
Teeth grinding (bruxism)
.
Risk factors
A risk factor is something that increases your chances of developing a certain condition. Risk factors of tooth loss include:
Certain
autoimmune diseases
like
Sjögren’s syndrome
.
Dry mouth
.
Hormonal changes like
menopause
.
Poor oral hygiene.
Some medications, especially ones that cause dry mouth.
Smoking
or using other types of tobacco.
Undermanaged
diabetes
(consistently having an
A1C
over 7%).
Vaping
.

In addition, some people are more prone to tooth loss,
genetically
speaking. If you have biological parents, grandparents or siblings with gum disease, you’re more likely to have this condition yourself.
What are the complications of tooth loss?
Without treatment, tooth loss can cause complications like:
Bone loss in your jaw.
Cosmetic changes (like gaps in your smile or facial sagging from lack of support).
Excess pressure on remaining teeth.
Malocclusion
(a “bad bite”).
Shifting teeth.
Speech changes or trouble enunciating.
TMJ disorder
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is tooth loss diagnosed?
A
dentist
diagnoses tooth loss during a dental exam. They’ll also check the health of your teeth and
gums
to see if you have conditions that might contribute to tooth loss (like tooth decay or gum disease).
Your dentist will also need to take
X-rays
. These images can tell them how much bone you’ve lost in the area and whether any tooth fragments remain in the socket.
Management and Treatment
How is tooth loss treated?
Unless you replace a lost tooth, you’re more likely to lose another one in the future. Replacing a tooth gives you the best chance for long-term oral health.
Dentists can treat tooth loss with:
Dental implants
. An implant replaces your missing tooth root. Then, your dentist attaches a
crown
to the top of the implant. Dental implants are the closest thing to natural teeth, and they last longer than any other replacement option.
Bridges
. A dental bridge attaches to the natural teeth on either side of the space for support, and an artificial tooth fills in the gap. Bridges last five to 15 years, on average.
Dentures
. Full dentures replace an entire arch of missing teeth. Partial dentures replace several missing teeth in your upper or lower jaw. You can get traditional or
implant-supported dentures
. On average, dentures last seven to 10 years.
How long does it take to recover from tooth loss treatment?
How long recovery takes depends on several factors like:
Which replacement option you choose.
How many teeth need replacements.
Your oral health.
Your overall health.
Your dentist is the best person to ask about your recovery timeline. They can give you an estimate based on your unique treatment plan.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for tooth loss?
Tooth loss might not be dangerous in a life-threatening sense. But losing even one tooth can cause additional issues that impact your health and quality of life. For example, if you can’t chew properly, you won’t be able to eat certain foods. You may not get enough nutrition as a result. In addition, gum disease (the leading cause of tooth loss) is an infection that can spread via your
bloodstream
throughout your entire body.
Preventive care
offers the best outlook. The best thing you can do is see your dentist regularly and practice good oral hygiene at home. But even if you’ve already lost a tooth (or all your teeth), it’s never too late to seek the treatment you deserve.
Prevention
Can tooth loss be prevented?
You can’t always prevent tooth loss, especially when it’s the result of an accident or injury. But there are things you can do to significantly reduce your risk:
Brush your teeth
twice a day using a soft toothbrush and
fluoride
toothpaste.
Floss
between your teeth once a day.
Visit your dentist regularly for exams and
cleanings
.
Wear a
mouth guard
if you grind your teeth or play contact sports.

When should I see my dentist?
You should visit your dentist regularly for exams and cleanings. For some people, these visits occur every six months. But you might need more frequent visits if you’re prone to cavities or gum disease. Ask your dentist how often you should have your teeth cleaned for best results.
You should also schedule an appointment with your dentist if you develop bad breath, bleeding gums, loose teeth or other telltale warning signs.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you’ve lost one or more teeth, you might want to ask your dentist questions like:
Do I need to treat tooth loss?
What type of teeth replacement do you recommend?
Does my health history impact what my treatment options are?
How long will treatment take?
How many office visits will I have?
How can I maintain results after treatment?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Maybe you cover your mouth when you laugh now. Or maybe you no longer smile for pictures. Tooth loss can have a monumental impact on your confidence, as well as your oral health. Sometimes, tooth loss happens despite your best efforts. But if you lose a tooth, it’s best to act fast. Prompt treatment can reduce your risk for complications like bone loss and infection. Ask your dentist for a personalized treatment plan.
