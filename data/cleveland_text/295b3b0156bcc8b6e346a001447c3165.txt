Overview
What is an ice pick headache?
An ice pick headache (primary stabbing headache) is head pain that’s sudden, sharp and stabbing. This pain usually targets the area behind your forehead and eyes (frontal area) or the side of your head near your ears (temporal area), but it can occur anywhere in your head. It usually lasts a few seconds. It can be sporadic or occur in clusters. The location can change with each jab or jolt.

This type of
headache
feels like an ice pick is chipping away at your head. An ice pick is a pointed metal tool used to break ice into smaller pieces.
Ice pick headaches can affect anyone at any age. But they're more common in
females
and those with other headache disorders, like
migraines
. Some studies suggest that only about 2% of people worldwide experience these headaches. However, one Norwegian study found that 1 in 3 people had ice pick headaches.
Treatment options are available if you need it.
Are ice pick headaches dangerous?
Ice pick headaches aren’t usually dangerous. Only in rare cases do they represent an underlying neurologic issue. But frequent headaches shouldn’t be ignored, especially if they happen with other symptoms like dizziness, nausea, watery eyes and a runny nose.
Let a healthcare provider know about your headaches. They can give you a diagnosis and tell you if they’re harmless or a sign of an underlying condition.
Symptoms and Causes
You may experience ice pick headache symptoms with these common triggers.
What causes an ice pick headache?
Experts aren’t sure what causes an ice pick headache. Research suggests that the
nerve
cells that process pain in your
brain
are overactive, which causes them to send pain signals more often than they should.
Research also suggests the following may contribute to an ice pick headache:

Irritated nerves (
trigeminal
and extratrigeminal nerves).
Migraines.
Inflammation
.
Temporary dysfunction of nerve fibers.
What triggers an ice pick headache?
Triggers are things in your environment that cause symptoms. Possible triggers of an ice pick headache may include:
Bright lights.
Quick posture changes or movements.
Physical exertion.
These vary from person to person. Keep note of what you were doing before a headache happened to help you determine what triggers your symptoms.
Can anxiety cause an ice pick headache?
Feeling strong emotions like
stress
or
anxiety
may trigger ice pick headache symptoms or intensify the pain you feel during a headache. Let a healthcare provider know if you get headaches when stressed or anxious. They may have recommendations to help you manage stress or anxiety to minimize how often headaches affect you.
What are the symptoms of an ice pick headache?
An ice pick headache may cause head pain that feels:
Sharp.
Stabbing.
Intense.
An ice pick headache may cause a single stabbing pain or a series of quick pains. They may occur once a day or several times a day. It’s rare to get ice pick headaches over several consecutive days, so talk to a provider if you have frequent headaches.
If you have migraines, ice pick headache pain happens in the same location as migraine headache pain. If you don’t have migraines, head pain is usually in the front of your head, around your eyes and temples.
How long do ice pick headaches normally last?
The stabbing pain that happens with an ice pick headache usually lasts less than three seconds. You may notice several stabs, which can last for a few seconds to minutes. You may have multiple headaches per day.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is an ice pick headache diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose ice pick headaches after learning more about your symptoms. They’ll offer a
physical exam
and testing to rule out conditions with similar symptoms. Imaging tests like an
MRI
may give your healthcare provider more information about what’s happening inside your head.
Let your provider know if you get migraines or other types of headaches regularly. Ice pick headaches are common with migraines.
Management and Treatment
How is an ice pick headache treated?
Ice pick headaches disappear quickly on their own. They don’t normally require treatment because the pain is usually gone by the time you take a medication (like a
pain reliever
).
But treatment is available if you need it. A healthcare provider may recommend the following medications to treat frequent ice pick headaches:
Indomethacin
(
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
).
Melatonin
.
Botulinum toxin
type A.
Gabapentin
.
Tricyclic antidepressants
.
Your provider will tell you about any potential side effects of these medications so you can make an informed decision about your health.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Because ice pick headaches happen sporadically and go away so quickly, many people don’t tell their healthcare providers about them. You may just deal with the pain when it happens. But you don’t have to.
It’s important not to self-diagnose these headaches and to talk to a healthcare provider about your symptoms. Headaches may be more than a painful nuisance. In rare instances, they’re a sign of a more serious problem. Even if these headaches are mostly harmless, it helps to hear from an expert. They’ll make sure everything’s alright. Treatment options are available if you need them.
