How do I take care of myself?
If you have transient lingual papillitis, the most important thing you can do is to leave the bumps alone. Yes, they look like tongue pimples. And yes, you may have an urge to pop them. Resist that urge. Unlike skin pimples, which happen when you have gunk trapped in one of your pores, the painful red and white bumps are part of your tongue and not for popping.
If you have transient lingual papillitis, you should avoid things that you know trigger the condition. For example, consider avoiding:
Spicy foods.
Acidic foods and drinks, like those made with lots of citrus fruit or vinegar.
Food and drinks made with lots of sugar or honey.
Any toothpaste or mouthwash that irritates your papillae.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Transient lingual papillitis isn’t a serious condition and often goes away without medical treatment. That said, talk to a healthcare provider anytime you notice changes in your tongue, gums or mouth that don’t go away after two weeks.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Here are some questions you may want to ask:
What kind of transient lingual papillitis do I have?
Will I need treatment?
Will it come back?
What can I do to keep transient lingual papillitis from coming back?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Lie bumps or liar’s tongue are colorful names for a common condition that affects your tongue. In transient lingual papillitis, you have tiny, painful bumps on your tongue. According to superstition, the tongue bumps happen when you tell a lie. In truth, they happen when something irritates your papillae, the tiny bumps that cover your tongue and contain your taste buds. Transient lingual papillitis may be painful and annoying, but it isn’t a serious medical issue and often clears up on its own. That said, talk to a healthcare provider if a bump on your tongue doesn’t go away.
