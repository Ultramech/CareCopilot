Vein of Galen Malformation
A vein of Galen malformation happens when an artery connects directly to a vein in a newborn’s brain. There aren’t any capillaries to slow down blood flow. This increases pressure and blood flow. It’s life-threatening if untreated. Embolization to stop blood flow to the vein may improve your child’s outlook.

What Is a Vein of Galen Malformation?
A vein of Galen malformation happens when arteries connect directly to a vein in your brain.
A vein of Galen malformation is a rare and serious blood vessel abnormality in your baby’s brain. It’s a type of
arteriovenous malformation
(AVM) that happens during fetal development.

Policy
When a fetus develops as expected, smaller blood vessels fuse together deep within the brain to form the vein of Galen. In a vein of Galen malformation, your child’s arteries connect directly to the
vein
. This means the arteries push their high-pressure blood directly into the vein without the usual capillary bridges that slow down blood flow.
But veins don’t have the wall strength to carry high-pressure blood. As a result, the vein of Galen swells and can bleed. Your child’s heart has to work on overdrive to manage the increased blood flow and pressure.
VOGM is life-threatening if untreated. It’s usually suspected during pregnancy and confirmed after your child is born. A healthcare provider will treat this condition as soon as possible to prevent complications.
What is the vein of Galen?
The vein of Galen (great cerebral vein) is a major blood vessel in your brain. It’s located deep inside your
brain
, above the
brainstem
. It’s responsible for draining blood from certain structures in your brain, like white matter. It helps your
blood
circulate as expected.
What are the types of vein of Galen malformations?
There are two types of VOGMs:
Choroidal
: Several arteries connect to the vein. This is the most common type and most severe.
Mural
: There are fewer connections to the vein.

Symptoms and Causes
Vein of Galen malformation symptoms
Early signs and symptoms of a vein of Galen malformation among infants may include:
Growth faltering
Large head size (
macrocephaly
)
Seizures
Swollen, visible veins on their scalp
Older children who have less severe cases and don’t receive a diagnosis as an infant may have
developmental delays
and persistent
headaches
.
What are the complications of a vein of Galen malformation?
Severe and life-threatening complications of VOGMs may include:
Brain bleed
Congestive heart failure
Hydrocephalus
Pulmonary hypertension
Stroke
Subarachnoid hemorrhage
Vein of Galen malformation causes
The exact cause isn’t well known.
Researchers
suggest the
RASA1
or
EPHB4
genetic variants
may be involved.
It’s not possible to know for certain the genetic outcomes of a pregnancy before it happens. But a
genetic counselor
can help you learn more about your risk of having a child with a genetic condition. And they can help you learn more about how a condition might affect you and your family.
Healthcare providers do know that there’s no way to prevent this condition. There isn’t anything you did — or didn’t do — during pregnancy to cause it.
Diagnosis and Tests
How a doctor diagnoses a vein of Galen malformation
A healthcare provider may suspect a vein of Galen malformation during a
pregnancy ultrasound
in the third trimester. The vein of Galen should look like a tube. Your provider may notice the tube instead has a large, ballooned section on it where it expanded.
After your baby is born, your child’s provider will perform a physical exam and review their symptoms. Their provider may use a stethoscope to listen to the sound of blood flow in your child’s head. They’ll listen for a pulsating sound (bruit) that may indicate that blood is moving faster than expected.
A
computed tomography (CT)
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
confirms a diagnosis. Imaging tests will give your child’s provider a better look at the malformation and other surrounding brain structures. They can review where it is and how big it is. These tests can also help your child’s care team plan for treatment.
Management and Treatment
How is a vein of Galen malformation treated?
Embolization
treats a vein of Galen malformation. This is a surgical procedure to stop blood flow to the arteries that feed into the vein. Here’s what you could expect during embolization:
An
anesthesiologist
will give your child general anesthesia. They’ll be asleep during the procedure.
A provider will make a very small incision — usually in your child’s groin — to insert a flexible tube (catheter) into your child’s artery.
They’ll carefully move the tube through your child’s artery to the treatment area in their brain.
A provider will inject an embolic agent (a material to close the openings) to stop blood flow in a specific area.
They’ll remove the catheter and bandage the small incision.

In some cases, surgery may be delayed until your child reaches at least 6 months to 1 year of age. This is to make sure that certain areas of your child’s body develop enough to handle the procedure. Your child will receive supportive care or medications to manage their symptoms. This also prevents complications before surgery.
When should I take my child to see a healthcare provider?
If your child has a VOGM, their provider will let you know what symptoms to look out for, especially when they’re cleared to leave the hospital after treatment. This could include:
Behavior changes (fussy or
lethargic
)
Fever
Seizures
Swelling
Vomiting

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the prognosis for a vein of Galen malformation?
With endovascular treatment (embolization), many children have an improved outlook. Your child’s care team will explain the risks and possible complications of the procedure so you can make an informed decision about their treatment.
If treatment is successful, your child might need another procedure in the future or close monitoring as they grow. This may include several follow-up appointments with specialists, in addition to their regular check-ups with a pediatrician. Some children don’t experience any long-term complications after receiving treatment, but this varies from child to child.
Vein of Galen malformation life expectancy
Treatment may significantly improve your child’s life expectancy. Because without it, some types of VOGM are fatal.

A lot of factors go into determining your child’s life expectancy, like the severity of the condition and whether surgery is a safe option. Your child’s situation may or may not reflect statistics. Their healthcare provider is the best person to speak with to learn more about what you can expect.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
As a new parent, the first moments with your baby may not be what you were expecting if they have a vein of Galen malformation. Maybe you’ve known about the diagnosis for months and delivered in a large, academic medical center with expert surgeons who were waiting to provide care for your baby. Or maybe your baby developed symptoms at home and you’ve rushed to the hospital. No matter how you got here, it’s a stressful time.
Treatment, while it comes with risks, may improve your child’s life expectancy. It’s easy to worry about what might happen next. But know that your child’s care team will be with you every step of the way. You’ll get to know your child’s providers well, as they’ll need continual monitoring and follow-up care throughout their life. Their providers can offer comfort and support and answer any questions you might have.
