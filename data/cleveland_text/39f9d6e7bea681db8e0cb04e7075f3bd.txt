How do I take care of myself to manage my symptoms?

Scratching your itchy skin can cause your skin to break open and bleed, which could lead to an infection. Use an anti-itch cream, moisturizer or cold compress for immediate relief. If your itchy skin continues, talk to your provider about additional treatment options.
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
You could feel immediate relief after applying a cream, lotion or moisturizer to your itchy skin, but your symptoms could take several days to several weeks before they go away completely. The timeline for when you’ll feel better varies based on the cause and your provider’s recommended treatment plan. The length of time for your symptoms to go away usually takes a few months or longer if an underlying condition caused your itchy skin at night.
