What’s the difference between weeping eczema and impetigo?
Impetigo
and weeping eczema are both skin conditions. While eczema is a type of
dermatitis
, impetigo is an infection of the skin. With impetigo, blisters and sores usually develop on the nose and mouth. Weeping eczema can occur anywhere on the body and is sometimes accompanied by red or purple blisters that ooze or “weep” clear- to straw-colored fluid.
Occasionally, areas affected by eczema can become infected and ooze pus-colored fluid. When this happens, a different type of treatment is usually needed.
How common is weeping eczema?
This condition is very common. Over 31 million Americans live with some type of eczema or dermatitis, including
atopic dermatitis
,
contact dermatitis
and
seborrheic dermatitis
. All types of eczema can weep, though severity and symptoms can vary.
How does weeping eczema affect my body?
The fluid-filled blisters that appear with weeping eczema ooze, causing wetness on the skin. The fluid dries and results in a yellow-to-orange crusty layer on your skin. Eczema is most common in areas where your skin flexes, such as behind the knees, inside the elbows and in front of the neck. However, it may develop anywhere on your body, including your:
Hands.
Face.
Lips.
Arms.
Legs.
Feet.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of weeping eczema?
People with weeping eczema may notice several different symptoms. Common signs include:
Advertisement
Blisters or open sores.
Drainage on the skin.
Burning, itching or soreness of the skin.
Redness.
Crusting.
In most cases, people with weeping eczema notice other eczema symptoms worsening, such as swelling or dry, itchy skin. Those who have severe cases of weeping eczema may also develop:
Fatigue
.
Fever
.
Chills
.
Achiness.
Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the armpit, neck or groin.
What causes weeping eczema?
Weeping eczema is the result of active inflammation in the skin. Prominent inflammation results in dilation of skin blood vessels. These dilated blood vessels then leak serum into the soft tissue of the skin, causing mild swelling (edema) and oozing of the serum onto the skin surface.
Importantly, when your skin becomes too dry, cracked or inflamed, infection can enter the skin and cause your eczema symptoms to worsen. Infection can occur with weeping eczema, but is a different condition. The most common infection in people with weeping eczema is staph (
staphylococcus
), a common bacteria. The herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) — the same virus that causes
cold sores
— can also cause weeping eczema if it enters the skin.
Is weeping eczema contagious?
Eczema and “weeping eczema” themselves aren’t contagious. However, a secondary infection associated with weeping eczema can potentially spread.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is weeping eczema diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will examine your skin to check for eczema symptoms. In some cases, tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. These may include:
Blood tests.
Allergy skin tests.
Skin biopsy
.
Bacterial culture.
Management and Treatment
How is weeping eczema treated?
Weeping eczema treatment depends on what caused your condition. There are several options that can help manage your symptoms. These include:
Corticosteroids
:
Topical steroids can help reduce inflammation and itchiness. In some cases, your healthcare provider may prescribe oral steroids, such as prednisone.
Antihistamines
:
Commonly used for allergies, these medications are taken in pill form to reduce the itchiness associated with eczema.
Immunosuppressants
:
These medications help lower your body’s immune response. As a result, inflammation is reduced.
If a secondary infection has developed, other medications may be needed.
Are there home remedies for weeping eczema?
Because weeping eczema is infection-related, the only thing that will clear it up completely is prescription medication. However, there are some things you can do at home to ease your symptoms. Weeping
eczema home remedies
include:
Probiotics
:
Research suggests that topical probiotics may help reduce the severity of eczema symptoms.
Natural oils:
Coconut oil, olive oil and sunflower seed oil all protect and restore the skin. They also help reduce inflammation.
Vitamins and supplements:
Fatty acids — such as black currant seed and evening primrose — are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 can also help improve common eczema symptoms.
Colloidal oatmeal bath:
This remedy helps soothe and relieve dry, itchy skin caused by eczema.
Diluted bleach bath:
Adding a very small amount of bleach to your bathwater can help kill bacteria on your skin. In turn, this can reduce redness, itching and scaling. When properly diluted and used sparingly, bleach baths are safe. (Taking too many can dry out your skin too much, though.) Talk to your healthcare provider before incorporating bleach baths into your regimen.

What can I expect if I have weeping eczema?
When treated promptly, weeping eczema should clear up within two weeks. People with severe cases may develop scarring.

Prevention

emollient-rich cream
