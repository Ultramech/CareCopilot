Cortisol
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that your adrenal glands (the glands on top of your kidneys) make. Cortisol affects several aspects of your health and helps regulate your body’s response to stress. High or low levels of cortisol can impact your health.

You may mainly think of cortisol when it comes to
stress
. But it’s an essential hormone that affects almost every organ and tissue in your body. It plays many other important roles, including:
Regulating how your body uses glucose (sugar) for energy
Decreasing
inflammation
Regulating
blood pressure
Helping control your sleep-wake cycle
Your body continuously monitors your cortisol levels to maintain steady levels (homeostasis). High or low cortisol levels can be harmful to your health.
Is cortisol a stress hormone?
Yes, cortisol plays a key role in managing your body’s stress response. Your body releases cortisol when you experience any of the following types of stress:
Acute (short-term) stress
Chronic (long-term) stress
Traumatic stress
But cortisol has many other functions, too.
How does cortisol affect my body?
Cortisol affects nearly every organ system in your body. And it helps regulate several key functions.
Regulating your body’s stress response
During times of stress, your body can release cortisol after releasing its “
fight or flight
” hormones, like
adrenaline
. This happens so you continue to stay on high alert. Cortisol also triggers the release of glucose (sugar) from your
liver
. This provides fast energy during times of stress.
Regulating metabolism and blood sugar levels
Metabolism
refers to the chemical processes in your body that allow you to live and function. Thousands of metabolic processes happen at all times.

Cortisol affects your metabolism by helping regulate how your body uses glucose (sugar) for energy. The hormone does this in many ways. For example, cortisol triggers your
pancreas
to decrease
insulin
and increase
glucagon
. Insulin lowers blood glucose (sugar). Glucagon raises it.
Cortisol also acts on other bodily tissues to manage glucose use, including your:
Adipose tissue (body fat)
Liver
Muscle
Suppressing inflammation
In short spurts, cortisol can boost your immunity by limiting inflammation. But if you have consistently high levels of cortisol, your body can get used to it. This can lead to inflammation and a weakened
immune system
.
Regulating blood pressure
The exact way in which cortisol regulates blood pressure in humans is unclear. But elevated levels of cortisol can cause
high blood pressure
. And lower-than-normal levels of cortisol can cause
low blood pressure
.
Helping control your sleep-wake cycle
Most people have lower cortisol levels in the evening when they go to sleep. And they have peak levels in the morning right before they wake up. This suggests that cortisol plays a key role in your
circadian rhythm
and how your body wakes up.
How does my body control cortisol levels?
Your body has an elaborate system to regulate your cortisol levels. Your
hypothalamus
and
pituitary gland
control the cortisol production in your adrenal glands. The process goes like this:
When the cortisol level in your blood falls, your hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
This directs your pituitary gland to make
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
.
ACTH then triggers your adrenal glands to make and release cortisol.
To have healthy cortisol levels, your hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal glands must all be functioning properly.
What causes high levels of cortisol?
If you have high levels of cortisol (hypercortisolism) for a long time, it’s usually
Cushing syndrome
. Causes of high cortisol levels and Cushing syndrome include:
Taking high doses of
corticosteroid
medications, like
prednisone
,
prednisolone
or
dexamethasone
Tumors
that produce ACTH — usually in your pituitary gland
Adrenal gland tumors
that cause excess cortisol
What are the symptoms of high cortisol levels?
Symptoms of high cortisol levels, or Cushing syndrome, can include:
Weight gain, especially in your
face
and belly
Fatty deposits between your shoulder blades
Wide, purple
stretch marks
on your belly
Muscle weakness in your upper arms and thighs
High blood sugar
, which often turns into
Type 2 diabetes
High blood pressure
Excessive hair growth
(hirsutism) in
females
Weak bones (
osteoporosis
) and bone breaks (
fractures
)
What causes low levels of cortisol?
Healthcare providers call lower-than-normal cortisol levels (hypocortisolism) adrenal insufficiency. There are two types of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary.

Primary adrenal insufficiency most often happens when your immune system attacks your adrenal glands. It’s called
Addison’s disease
. An infection or blood loss to the tissue in your adrenal glands can also lead to a lack of cortisol.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency happens if you have an underactive pituitary gland (
hypopituitarism
) or a pituitary tumor. These conditions can limit ACTH production, which limits cortisol production. You can also develop low cortisol levels after suddenly stopping treatment with corticosteroids.
What are the symptoms of low cortisol levels?
Symptoms of low cortisol levels, or adrenal insufficiency, can include:
Fatigue
Unintentional weight loss
Loss of appetite
Low blood pressure
When should I see my healthcare provider about my cortisol levels?
If you have symptoms of Cushing syndrome or adrenal insufficiency, contact your healthcare provider.
If you’re concerned about your daily stress levels, talk to your provider about steps you can take to
manage stress
.

Additional Common Questions
How can I reduce my cortisol levels?
If you have Cushing syndrome, you’ll need medical treatment to lower your cortisol levels. Treatment usually involves medication and/or surgery.
In general, though, there are several ways to help lower your cortisol levels, including:
Get quality
sleep
. Chronic sleep issues, like
insomnia
or
working a night shift
, can cause higher cortisol levels.
Move your body
. Regular physical activity helps improve sleep quality and reduce stress.
Practice
deep breathing exercises
. Controlled breathing helps stimulate your
parasympathetic nervous system
, your “rest and digest” system. This helps lower cortisol levels.
Enjoy yourself and
laugh
. Laughing promotes the release of
endorphins
and suppresses cortisol. Participating in fun activities can also promote feelings of well-being.
Maintain healthy relationships
. Having tense and unhealthy relationships can cause frequent stress.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Cortisol often gets a bad rap. But it’s an essential hormone that impacts several aspects of your body. Many stress-relieving strategies can help manage your cortisol levels. But in some cases, having abnormally high or low levels of cortisol is out of your control. If you experience symptoms of high or low cortisol levels, it’s important to see your healthcare provider. They can run some simple tests to see if your adrenal glands or pituitary gland is responsible for your symptoms.
