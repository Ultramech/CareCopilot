Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of Achenbach syndrome
The syndrome typically affects the palmar (front) surface of your index finger, middle finger and your ring finger. Symptoms include:
Painful tingling feeling in your fingers and your palms that happens suddenly and quickly gets worse
Swelling that affects your palms and the middle section of your fingers but not your fingertips, which can make it hard for you to move your fingers
Skin discoloration
that looks dark blue or black (people with dark skin may notice the skin on their fingers or palms is darker than usual)
Achenbach syndrome causes
Your symptoms happen when
small blood vessels
in your fingers burst and blood leaks into nearby tissues. These blood vessels typically burst after you hurt yourself, like you pinch your finger in a door. In Achenbach syndrome, even gentle pressure from doing something like sweeping or washing clothes by hand can damage your capillaries. Healthcare providers don’t know why this happens.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose Achenbach syndrome
A healthcare provider will ask when your symptoms started and if you recall hurting your fingers. There aren’t lab tests that diagnose Achenbach syndrome, but providers may do tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms, like:
Acute
ischemia
(loss of blood flow)
Acrocyanosis
(painless discoloration of the hand and digits)
Collagen vascular disease
Microemboli, tiny particles that can block your blood vessels
Raynaud’s syndrome
Vasculitis
(inflammation of blood vessels)

Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for Achenbach syndrome?
Your healthcare provider may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication, like acetaminophen, but there’s no specific treatment.
The syndrome symptoms typically go away on their own within a few days to two weeks. But you should contact your provider if your symptoms continue or get worse.
The combination of mysterious symptoms and tests to check for serious illnesses may make you feel anxious and afraid. Achenbach syndrome symptoms are scary because they happen so quickly and for no apparent reason. Likewise, you may feel anxious while you wait for test results. Your healthcare providers will understand if you’re feeling anxious. They’ll answer your questions and support you during this understandably upsetting experience.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have Achenbach syndrome?
Your symptoms may come back months or years later. Talk to your healthcare provider if that happens. They may do follow-up physical exams to check for other issues that may be causing the symptoms.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Achenbach syndrome is a rare condition that makes your fingers swell and turn dark blue or black. It isn’t serious, and your symptoms will go away within a few days. But it’s still scary when your body goes through a sudden and dramatic change.
Your healthcare providers will move quickly to rule out other, more serious diseases that can cause these symptoms. It may take some time for your provider to have test results. And it can be stressful to be waiting for answers and solutions. Don’t be shy about sharing your concerns. Your providers will understand.
