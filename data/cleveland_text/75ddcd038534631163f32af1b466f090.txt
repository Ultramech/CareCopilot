Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis (outlook) for toddler constipation?
Constipation is usually temporary and treatable. With the proper diet and fluid intake, your child can have more regular bowel movements.
If it’s not treated, constipation can become worse. If your toddler’s poop stays inside of their colon, it keeps getting larger, firmer and drier. This makes it more painful to pass, and your child will be more likely to hold back their poop.

prevent constipation in your toddler

A note from Cleveland Clinic
It can be hard to watch your toddler deal with constipation. But thankfully, constipation is usually temporary.

If constipation lasts longer than two weeks, your child may need additional treatment.
