ABO Incompatibility
ABO incompatibility happens during pregnancy, when the mother’s ABO blood type is different from the fetus’s. This includes blood types A, B, AB and O. It’s fairly common and doesn’t usually pose risks.

What Is ABO Incompatibility During Pregnancy?
ABO incompatibility is when you’re pregnant and the fetus has an ABO
blood type
that doesn’t match yours. The mismatch can cause your body to have a mild reaction to the fetus’s blood. It’s most common if you have type O blood and the fetus has type A, B or AB blood. It happens in about
15 out of 100
pregnancies.

Rarely, blood group mismatches can cause the mother’s immune system to attack the fetus’s red blood cells. This is called
hemolytic disease of the newborn
(HDN). Affected babies have anemia and
jaundice
.
The good news is that ABO incompatibility issues are
extremely rare
, happening in under 1% of pregnancies. And if there are problems, there are treatments that can keep you and your baby safe.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of ABO incompatibility
Babies born with ABO hemolytic disease may not have symptoms. Sometimes, they have jaundice that starts within the first 24 hours of birth. This is a sign that some of their red blood cells are breaking down too soon. When they break down, red blood cells release a substance called bilirubin that makes skin look yellow.
But many infants are born with jaundice. Whether your baby needs treatment depends on how severe it is.
ABO incompatibility causes
ABO incompatibility happens when the mom has one blood type within the ABO blood group (A, B, AB or O) and the fetus has a different type. Each blood type has unique
antigens
on red blood cells. Antigens are like name tags that let your immune system know that a red blood cell belongs. A has “A” antigens on red blood cells. B has “B” antigens on red blood cells, and so forth. Your immune system won’t attack if it recognizes an antigen.

If the fetus’s blood cells have an antigen your immune system doesn’t recognize, it may flag them as a threat. It may make
antibodies
that attack the fetus’s red blood cells.
But ABO incompatibility doesn’t usually cause your immune system to launch harmful attacks. This happens more with “Rh incompatibility.” Rh factors determine whether you have a positive or negative blood type. The harmful attacks with Rh incompatibility can happen when the mother has blood type with Rh- and the fetus has Rh+ blood type.
If there’s a chance that you and the fetus have Rh incompatibility, you can take medicines to keep the fetus safe.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
In the U.S., screening for blood type incompatibility is part of routine prenatal care. This lets your healthcare provider know if there’s a chance of blood type incompatibility that may pose risks to your pregnancy.
If your baby is born with signs of disease, your healthcare provider may do tests to check their:
Blood type
, to see if blood type incompatibility may be what’s causing issues
Bilirubin levels
, to see if their levels are so high that they need treatment
Levels of antibodies
, to see if your immune system is launching attacks
Levels of red blood cells
, to see if they have anemia
If your baby is born with signs of severe disease, your provider will look for causes other than ABO incompatibility.
Management and Treatment
How is it treated?
Neither you nor the fetus will likely need treatment. If your baby develops jaundice, their healthcare provider may suggest
phototherapy
. This treatment uses safe UV (ultraviolet) lights to help your baby’s body get rid of excess bilirubin.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
ABO incompatibility rarely causes problems during pregnancy. With other blood type incompatibilities — like those related to Rh factor — your provider may need to closely monitor your pregnancy. You may need to take medicines to keep the fetus safe.
The most important thing to know is that providers go to great lengths to keep pregnancy safe for you and your baby. A blood type incompatibility doesn’t prevent most women from delivering healthy newborns.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Having a mismatched blood type during pregnancy is common. But just because there’s a mismatch between you and the fetus doesn’t mean there’ll be problems. This is usually the case with ABO incompatibility. It’s common but doesn’t usually cause issues. If there’s a chance of an incompatibility leading to serious disease, your provider will keep close tabs on your pregnancy. And they’ll give you medicines to protect your pregnancy.
