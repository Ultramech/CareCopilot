Policy
SLPs work with people from birth through old age. They work with small children who are having trouble talking or understanding what’s being communicated. They work with people who have difficulty communicating because of developmental disorders,
brain
injuries,
head and neck cancers
and neurological conditions.
“Speech-language pathologist” is the more appropriate term for a “speech therapist.” An SLP uses
speech therapy
to help people with communication and swallowing disorders.
What does a speech-language pathologist do?
Speech-language pathologists treat:
Articulation disorders
, conditions that make it challenging to use your muscles to form sounds when speaking.
Cognitive-communication disorders
, conditions that involve barriers to communication involving your brain. Barriers include impaired attention and problems organizing your thoughts or remembering.
Language disorders
, conditions that make it difficult to read words, phrases or stories, or to comprehend what others are saying in conversation. It may be challenging to express yourself in ways others understand. Selective language impairment and
aphasia
are examples.
Phonological disorders
, conditions where you can form sounds correctly with your
speaking
muscles
— but what comes out breaks the rules for how speech should sound.
Resonance disorders
, conditions that disrupt the way sound travels through your
mouth
,
nose
or
throat
when speaking. For example, a
cleft palate
causes a split in the roof of your mouth, changing how sound waves vibrate. It makes your voice sound nasally.
Social communication disorders
, disorders that make it difficult to communicate in social situations. You may struggle to understand the social cues that help you understand and relate to others. Taking turns speaking during a conversation is one example of a social cue.
Speech impairments
, conditions that make it difficult to communicate and be understood. Examples include
childhood apraxia of speech
,
dysarthria
,
stuttering
and
tongue-tie
(ankyloglossia).
Swallowing disorders
(dysphagia)
, conditions that make it difficult to swallow food and fluids or take oral medications safely.
Voice disorders
(dysphonia)
, conditions that affect your
vocal cords
, making it challenging to produce sounds. Examples include
vocal cord dysfunction
,
vocal cord lesions
and
vocal cord paralysis
.

SLPs may also work with Deaf and hard-of-hearing populations to help them communicate more effectively. But
audiologists
are more likely to offer this treatment.
