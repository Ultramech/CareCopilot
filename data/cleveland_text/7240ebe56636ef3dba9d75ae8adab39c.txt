Overview
What is a radiologic technologist?
A radiologic technologist (RT) is a healthcare professional who performs imaging tests and administers radiation therapy. RTs are sometimes called radiographers.

Policy
RTs need at least an associate degree and two to four years of training in a hospital-based program or at an accredited college or university. All RTs must pass a national certification exam from the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists. Some states in the U.S. require RTs to earn and maintain a state license.
RTs aren’t doctors — they don’t have medical degrees (MD) or doctor of osteopathic medicine degrees (DO). An RT doesn’t diagnose conditions or prescribe treatments.
What do they do?
Radiologic technologists help you prepare for imaging tests, set up and use the equipment during tests, and help doctors during some treatments and procedures.
RTs work closely with
radiologists
and
radiation oncologists
. An RT might help you get ready for some kinds of tests by injecting dyes into one of your veins so they show up during the test.
They can administer lots of different imaging tests, including:
CT scans
MRIs
PET scans
Ultrasounds
X-rays
Mammograms
An RT can help you if you need
radiation therapy
. RTs who administer radiation therapy are sometimes called radiation therapists.
During tests or radiation therapy, your RT will:
Answer any questions you have
Ensure the testing or treatment equipment is set up and working properly
Help you position your body correctly
Make sure you’re safe and comfortable

After you’re done, your RT will evaluate the test or treatment results with your doctor. They’ll also update your medical record with any findings or results.
An RT may assist during treatments like
angioplasty
or the insertion of a
stent
. Your RT might perform imaging tests so your healthcare provider can clearly see your blood vessels during the procedure.
Specialties

Some RTs specialize in a specific kind of imaging test. Your RT might have a special focus in:

Where do they work?
Most RTs work in hospitals. But they can also work in other healthcare locations, including:
Independent doctors’ offices
Non-hospital clinics
Nursing homes
Outpatient care centers
They may work in a dedicated room for imaging tests, or they may bring mobile testing equipment to you if you can’t move. This is common if you’re in the emergency room or an operating room.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It can be stressful to need an imaging test, even if it’s a routine screening. A radiologic technologist (RT) will help you feel comfortable during your test. If you end up needing radiation therapy, an RT will make sure you get the treatment safely.
Ask your RT any questions you have about your test or treatment. They’re experts who are there to help. Even if they do this work every day, it might be your first time. There’s no such thing as a silly question when you’re trying to understand your health better.
