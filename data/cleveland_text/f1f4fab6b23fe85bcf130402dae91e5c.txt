Myofascial Release Therapy

Overview
What is myofascial release therapy?
Myofascial release therapy
is a hands-on technique used to manage myofascial pain. “Myo” means muscle. “Fascial” refers to the connective tissue that covers and supports the muscles throughout your entire body. During myofascial release therapy, your therapist doesn’t focus specifically on your muscles. They focus on releasing tension in your fascial tissues.

What is fascia?
You can think of
fascia
like a spider web. The stringy tissue is densely woven throughout your muscles, bones, nerves, arteries, veins and organs. Your fascia is one continuous structure throughout your body. Each part of your body is connected to it in some way. That’s why if there’s a snag in the tissue in one part of your body, it can cause pain in another part of your body.
Normally, fascia is flexible and stretchy. But it’s strong. It provides structural support to your body and protects your
muscles
. Fascia is usually able to move without any restrictions. When your body experiences any kind of trauma, your fascia loses its flexibility. It becomes tightened and more rigid. The tightness can lead to pain and loss of motion, which can affect your quality of life.
Is myofascial release the same as trigger point therapy?
Yes. Myofascial release therapy is also called myofascial trigger point therapy. This is because myofascial pain originates in various trigger points in your body. These trigger points are stiff areas in your fascial tissue. They feel like small bumps, nodules or knots in your muscles.
Tightened trigger points can restrict your muscle and joint movement. You may have pain at the site of a trigger point or widespread pain throughout your body. Myofascial release therapy focuses on releasing the tension in these trigger points.

Treatment Details
What happens during myofascial release therapy?
During your myofascial release therapy sessions, you’ll work with a healthcare provider trained in myofascial release therapy. Your provider may be a:
Physical therapist
.
Occupational therapist.
Massage therapist.
Chiropractor.
Sports medicine specialist.
Athletic trainer
.
Osteopathic physician.
Your sessions will take place in a private room at your provider’s office. Your provider will first locate the fascial tissues throughout your body that feel stiff and tight. These areas are commonly called trigger points or knots. Once they find the knots, they’ll apply gentle, constant pressure to these areas.
Your provider will use direct contact on your
skin
. They won’t use any oils or lotions. They need to be able to feel the tightness in your fascia. The pressure will be applied slowly in an attempt to lengthen your fascial tissues. Your provider will knead and stretch your fascial tissues repeatedly. When they feel the pressure and tension release, they’ll move on.
What happens after myofascial release therapy?
After your provider performs myofascial release therapy, you may feel sore in the areas they stretched. But the soreness should go away fairly quickly. You should feel a lot looser in those areas than you did before.
For the greatest benefit, you’ll need to see your provider consistently. They may recommend treatments every one to three days. Each session will last 15 to 50 minutes. Your provider may recommend returning for sessions for a few weeks or a few months. It will depend on the cause and severity of your condition.
