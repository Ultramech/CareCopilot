Treatment Details
How do serotonin antagonists work?
To understand how serotonin antagonists work, it helps to understand how serotonin receptors and
serotonin
function.

There are several types of serotonin receptors in your body. The highest concentration is in your gastrointestinal system. Serotonin antagonists work to block the 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptors in your gastrointestinal (GI) system and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). The CTZ is an area of your
medulla oblongata
that plays a role in initiating vomiting.
Serotonin is a
neurotransmitter
that also acts as a
hormone
. About 90% of your serotonin is in the cells that line your gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin has several roles, including regulating your mood, digestion, sleep and more.
Nausea happens when your body releases serotonin into your gut faster than it can digest it. Your brain then receives a chemical message, which you perceive as nausea.
Serotonin antagonists fit into 5-HT3 receptors but don’t activate them. Instead, they don’t let serotonin act on the receptors. This can prevent or treat nausea.
How long do I need to take a serotonin antagonist?
It’s easier to prevent nausea and vomiting than it is to stop them once they start. Because of this, healthcare providers usually have people who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy take serotonin antagonist medication on a strict schedule around the clock.
Your provider will be able to give you more specific information and instructions.

How well do serotonin antagonists work?
Serotonin antagonists generally work well to prevent nausea. But everyone is different, so the results can vary. Some medications may work better for you than others.
What are the risks or complications of serotonin antagonists?
Serotonin antagonists are generally safe for most people. There are a few considerations to keep in mind before you start taking this medication.
Heart issues
People who have certain heart conditions may be extra sensitive to serotonin antagonists, which can be dangerous. It’s important to let your healthcare provider know if you have any of the following conditions if they’re going to prescribe you an anti-nausea medication:
Long QT syndrome
.
Ventricular arrhythmia
.
Heart disease
.
Serotonin syndrome
Taking serotonin antagonists alongside other medications that affect your serotonin levels can lead to
serotonin syndrome
, a potentially life-threatening drug reaction. This occurs because when the 5-HT3 receptors are blocked, there’s more serotonin circulating in your bloodstream.
Other medications that affect your serotonin levels include:
SSRIs
.
SNRIs
.
Mirtazapine
.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
.
Be sure to tell your provider if you take any of these medications.
