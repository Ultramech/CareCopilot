What does prurigo of pregnancy look like?
Prurigo of pregnancy rash looks like small bug bites,
acne
or pimples on your skin. These bumps can be crusty or scaly. Prurigo rash spots are shades of pink, red or purple. Some may contain hair follicles and be extremely itchy and uncomfortable. The spots you get from prurigo of pregnancy can be as small as the tip of a pencil or as wide as the eraser at the top of a pencil. They often cluster together in groups.
Where does prurigo of pregnancy start?
Prurigo of pregnancy tends to show up on the backs of your elbows or knees (on the skin around joints or folds of skin) but can also occur on the shoulders, arms, legs and belly.
How common is prurigo of pregnancy?
Prurigo of pregnancy occurs in 1 in 300 pregnancies. It can start at any time in pregnancy but is most commonly reported in the second and third trimesters (between 13 and 40 weeks). Prurigo of pregnancy often continues for weeks after your baby is born.
What’s the difference between prurigo and PUPPP rash during pregnancy?
Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP)
is the most common type of pregnancy rash. It occurs in 1 in 160 pregnancies. You may be at an increased risk if you’re expecting twins, triplets or more. PUPP rash also causes itchy, discolored bumps or patches on the skin. PUPP rash tends to occur on areas of your skin that are very stretched during pregnancy, such as your abdomen, butt or thighs. PUPP rash is most commonly diagnosed in the last months of pregnancy. Prurigo of pregnancy can occur anywhere on the body. Both conditions don’t pose any risk to the fetus.
