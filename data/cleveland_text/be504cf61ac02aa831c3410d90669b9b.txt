Anorgasmia, or trouble having an orgasm.
Erectile dysfunction
, or problems getting an erection.
Why is sex tied to depression?
Depression affects sex because of biology. It starts with chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters communicate between your brain, where sexual desire starts, and your sex organs. When your brain thinks desire, your body responds by increasing blood flow to the sex organs. Increased blood flow triggers arousal through an erection or vaginal lubrication.
In a person with depression, the sex-related chemicals are out of balance. As a result, sexual desire is low or missing. Low levels of some of these chemicals can also dull pleasurable feelings.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the different ways that depression can cause sexual dysfunction?
The biology behind depression and sexual dysfunction is clear. But the ways depression affects our relationships and outlook on life are more complicated. Sexual challenges may follow certain symptoms of depression:
Inability to experience pleasure.
Loss of interest in activities.
Low energy levels.
Mood swings.
Reduced self-esteem.
Do antidepressants cause sexual side effects?
Antidepressants, or
depression medicines
, are highly effective in easing depression. But many of these drugs come with sexual side effects.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
are an example. SSRIs work by boosting levels of the brain chemical serotonin. Increased serotonin can help improve mood. But it can also prevent normal communication between the brain and sex organs. SSRIs may make it difficult for a man to get an erection or ejaculate. These drugs can also prevent a woman from having an orgasm.

Other antidepressants focus on different chemicals in the brain. Drugs that increase dopamine or norepinephrine are less likely to have sexual side effects.
