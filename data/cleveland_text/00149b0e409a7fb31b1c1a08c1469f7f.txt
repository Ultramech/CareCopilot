Baker Cyst (Popliteal Cyst)
Baker’s cysts are small, fluid-filled lumps that form on the back of your knee. They grow after something causes swelling in your knee. They usually aren’t serious. But you should still see a healthcare provider to get it diagnosed. It’s rare, but Baker’s cysts can share symptoms with more serious issues like blood clots.

What Is a Baker’s Cyst?
Baker’s cysts develop when something damages your knee joint or the tissues around it and extra fluid drains out of your knee.
A Baker’s cyst is a small, fluid-filled bump that forms on the back of your knee. Healthcare providers sometimes call them Baker cysts or popliteal cysts.

They develop when something damages your
knee joint
or the tissues around it. The damage makes extra fluid drain out of your knee. The fluid can only drain in one direction — out the back of your joint. That buildup forms the sac that becomes a Baker’s cyst.
Popliteal cysts are benign growths. That means they aren’t tumors and are never a sign or symptom of cancer. But visit a healthcare provider as soon as you notice a new growth or lump behind your knee.
Symptoms and Causes
Baker’s cyst symptoms
The bump that forms behind your knee is the most obvious symptom of a Baker cyst. You might also notice:
Knee pain
Stiffness
Trouble bending your knee as far as you usually can
Swelling
in your knee, thigh or calf
You might not experience any symptoms. You may never know you have a popliteal cyst until a healthcare provider notices it during a physical exam.
Baker’s cyst causes
Anything that damages your knee joint can cause swelling and lead to a popliteal cyst. The most common causes are
knee arthritis
and injuries.
Arthritis damages tissue in your joints over time. That breakdown can make your body produce extra fluid. Then, the fluid can build up in your knee and become a Baker’s cyst.
Injuries can also lead to Baker’s cysts. The damage from an injury can cause swelling in your knee. That can also lead to fluid buildup which can turn into a cyst.

Baker’s cyst risk factors
Anyone can develop a Baker’s cyst. But some people may be more likely to, including:
Adults between the ages of 35 and 70
Athletes
People who put lots of pressure on their knees at work or for a physical hobby
People with arthritis
Complications of cysts behind your knee
A cyst can rupture if it fills up too fast or with too much pressure. Picture filling up a water balloon too fast. Too much water or pressure makes the balloon burst. The same thing can happen to a cyst.
A ruptured cyst can cause other symptoms in your knee and lower leg, including:
Sharp, stabbing pain in your knee or calf
Swelling in your calf and lower leg
A feeling like water is running down your leg, but the feeling comes from inside your body
Nerve
damage
Compartment syndrome
Baker’s cysts can sometimes cause swelling and discoloration in your lower leg. These can be similar to symptoms of a
blood clot
. A blood clot is an emergency. See a healthcare provider right away if you think you might have one.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose popliteal cysts
A healthcare provider will diagnose a Baker’s cyst with a
physical exam
. They’ll examine your leg and look for a lump. Tell your provider when you first noticed the bump and if you’re experiencing any other symptoms. If you hurt your knee, tell your provider what happened.
Your provider might use a few imaging tests to diagnose a Baker’s cyst, including:
X-ray
Ultrasound
MRI
Management and Treatment
Baker’s cyst treatment
Your healthcare provider will treat the cause of the Baker’s cyst. The cyst will usually go away when the damage in your knee that led to it heals. You might need:
The
RICE or MEAT methods
:
These are ways of managing injuries at home. Your provider will suggest the one that’s best for you and your knee joint.
Medications
:
You might need over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammation medications like
NSAIDs
or acetaminophen. Your provider might give you a prescription for
corticosteroids
or a
cortisone shot
.
Physical therapy
:
Your provider might suggest physical therapy if you’re recovering from an injury or have arthritis. A physical therapist will give you exercises that strengthen the muscles around your affected knee.
Surgery
: You may need surgery if you have a severe knee injury, like a
ligament
tear or
broken bone
. It’s very rare to need surgery to remove a Baker’s cyst. Your provider will usually only suggest it if the cyst causes severe pain. Or makes it hard to use your knee.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Some popliteal cysts go away on their own. But don’t assume anything about a new lump or growth. Visit a healthcare provider. They’ll diagnose a cyst and make sure it’s not something more serious.

Outlook / Prognosis
How long does a Baker’s cyst last?
It depends on what caused it. Most cysts go away as soon as the swelling gets better. This is usually within a few weeks. Even if you have arthritis, a cyst won’t be permanent.
Your body will reabsorb the fluid as your knee heals. Follow your provider’s suggestions to prevent any more damage.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Picturing a water balloon forming on the back of your knee might make you queasy. But most Baker’s cysts aren’t serious. They sometimes don’t cause any symptoms. And a cyst might even go away on its own.
Make sure you get any new growths on your body checked out. Especially if they appear suddenly or after an injury. Your healthcare provider will help you understand what caused the cyst and how you can help your knee heal.
