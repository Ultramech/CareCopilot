Overview
What is MoviPrep® bowel preparation?
MoviPrep® is a brand name for a medication that contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It cleans out your colon (large intestine) to prepare it for a colonoscopy. PEG works by pulling water into your colon so it’s easy to have a bowel movement. The ascorbic acid also draws in water, which helps move poop through your bowel more quickly.

Why is bowel prep important?
Bowel prep completely clears your colon of stool. It’s essential because it gives your gastroenterologist the best view of the lining of your colon so they can detect polyps or cancer. For your doctor, a clean colon is like driving on a clear, sunny day. A dirty colon is like driving in a rainstorm.
If you’re a Cleveland Clinic patient, you must follow the instructions for bowel preparation exactly as prescribed or your colonoscopy will be canceled.
How do I use MoviPrep?
MoviPrep comes in a kit that contains two pouches and a mixing container. To make the bowel prep drink, you empty one pouch into the container and then add water. You’ll drink one solution the day before your exam and one the morning of your exam.
Be sure to follow all the instructions before mixing and drinking the bowel prep solution.
Key preparation instructions
The following instructions are key to a successful colonoscopy:
Your bowel must be empty so your doctor can see your colon clearly. Follow the instructions you get from your gastroenterologist exactly as they are written.
Don’t eat any solid food the entire day before your colonoscopy. Drink only clear liquids.
Get your bowel preparation kit at least five days before your colonoscopy.
Transportation on the day of your colonoscopy
A responsible driver must be with you when you check in for your colonoscopy. They must stay in the waiting area until you’re discharged. You’re not allowed to leave alone after your colonoscopy. If you don’t have a driver to take you home, your exam will be canceled. You aren’t allowed to operate any type of transportation (like a bike, car, scooter, etc.) or leave the facility alone.

When to mix your bowel preparation
The MoviPrep® carton contains pouches and a disposable container for mixing. Follow the mixing instructions on the carton. Mix the MoviPrep solution no sooner than 24 hours before it will be used. You may mix in the flavor pack that came with the bowel preparation. Don’t add ice, sugar or flavorings to the solution. You can refrigerate the preparation.
Taking your bowel prep
Read all the instructions before mixing the bowel prep solution. You’ll take the preparation in two parts.
Step 1: 6:00 pm the evening before your colonoscopy
Drink an 8-ounce glass of bowel preparation every 15 minutes until you drink half the bowel prep solution

Step 2: Six hours before your colonoscopy
Drink an 8-ounce glass of bowel preparation every 15 minutes until the bowel prep solution is gone
You may continue to drink clear liquids up to three hours before your exam
Some people's bowels move slowly, and they may need different instructions. Please see your doctor for personalized bowel prep instructions if you have:
Medical conditions that need special accommodations
Had poor bowel prep results or a failed bowel prep in the past
Had difficulty with anesthesia during a past procedure
How long will I be pooping after MoviPrep?
MoviPrep tends to work more quickly, with most people having diarrhea within one hour. How long you’ll continue to have diarrhea varies.

Additional Common Questions
What if I have constipation?
You may take extra laxatives in the days leading up to your prep. This should help resolve your constipation before your bowel prep day.
What if I’ve had poor prep results in the past?
Contact your physician as you’ll likely need additional bowel prep instructions.
What if I have motility issues from a medical condition?
Certain medical conditions and medications can slow bowel emptying or lead to constipation. Conditions like
Parkinson’s
,
multiple sclerosis
(MS) or using a wheelchair can slow down your digestion. Medications like narcotics, gabapentin and anticholinergic medications can also have an impact. Contact your physician and be sure to share your medical history and current medication use, as you’ll likely need extra time and additional laxatives to complete your bowel prep.

What if I can’t drink a large volume of liquid?
Start your prep two to three hours earlier to allow yourself more time to complete the entire prep.
What if I can't finish my bowel prep?
If you can’t finish your entire bowel prep, you’ll likely need to reschedule your colonoscopy due to poor prep quality.
Do I still have to complete the entire prep if I’ve had bariatric surgery?
Gastric bypass surgery involves your stomach and small bowel. It doesn’t change the length of your colon. You may need to drink smaller amounts, more slowly. You’ll need to complete the entire bowel prep, it may just take longer to complete it.
What if I’m on dialysis?
Please consult your nephrologist prior to scheduling to get instructions that are specific to you. In general, dialysis patients take the
Golytely
bowel prep and have the procedure on the same day as their dialysis (colonoscopy in AM, dialysis in PM).
How do I know if something is a clear liquid?
If you can pour it in a glass and you can see through it, it’s considered "clear liquid."
Can I take Uber®, Lyft®, taxi or bus home?
An adult must be present with you at check-in for your colonoscopy and remain in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged. You can hire a driver to take you home only if this adult escort is with you at check-in, remains in the endoscopy area until you’re discharged, and takes the hired ride home with you.
Can I “sleep it off” here and drive myself home?
No, you must have an adult with you when you check in. Your responsible adult must remain in the endoscopy center during your procedure and then drive you home. You can’t drive a vehicle for the rest of the day.
