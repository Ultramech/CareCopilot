Benign Soft Tissue Tumors
Benign soft tissue tumors are noncancerous tumors. These tumors can develop anywhere you have soft tissue such as your muscles, tendons and fat. Treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor and/or radiation therapy to keep the tumor from coming back.

Overview
What are benign soft tissue tumors?
Benign soft tissue tumors are noncancerous lumps under your
skin
. They develop anywhere you have soft tissue such as your
muscles
,
tendons
and fat. Depending on your situation, your healthcare provider may recommend surgery to remove the
tumor
and/or
radiation therapy
to keep the tumor from coming back (recurring).

What are soft tissue tumor types?
There are dozens of soft tissue tumor types. Some of the more common tumor types include:
Lipomas
: Tumors that form from fat cells.
Angiolipomas
are lipomas made of fat and
blood vessels
.
Nerve sheath tumors
: Tumors in soft tissue that surrounds and supports your nerves.
Schwannomas
and
neurofibromas
are common nerve sheath tumors.
Hemangiomas
: Tumors formed of blood cells.
Fibromas
: Tumors made of fibrous connective tissue.
Desmoid tumors
are fibromas.
Benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH)
: Tumors that are fibrous masses that may develop anywhere in your body.
Symptoms and Causes
What are benign soft tissue tumor symptoms?
You can have this condition without having symptoms. Common symptoms may include:
Lumps or bumps under your skin that feel soft or squishy when you touch them.
Pain if a large tumor presses on a
nerve
or organ.
What causes benign soft tissue tumors?
Medical researchers don’t know all the reasons people develop benign soft tissue tumors. Some people inherit conditions that cause soft tissue tumors. Other soft tissue tumors happen when
genes mutate
or change during a person’s lifetime.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are benign soft tissue tumors diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will take a thorough medical history. They may ask how long you’ve had the lump or bump and if it’s growing. They may ask about any recent injury that may explain why you have a lump. They’ll do a
physical examination
.

They may do imaging tests, too. Providers may be able to diagnose some benign soft tissue tumors with
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
. However, providers occasionally will do biopsies to diagnose benign soft tissue tumors. (A
biopsy
involves taking a sample of tumor tissue.) Medical pathologists examine tissue samples under a microscope to determine if the tumor is benign or cancerous.
Tests show I have a benign soft tissue tumor. Should I be worried?
Remember, a benign soft tissue tumor isn’t
cancer
. Benign soft tissue tumors are about 10 times more common than malignant or cancerous soft tissue tumors.
In general, you could have cause for concern if a
bump or lump
that’s a soft tissue tumor affects your quality of life. For example, soft tissue tumors that affect your nerves can be very painful. Some benign soft tissue tumors may grow large enough to press on your organs and affect their function. If you develop a soft tissue tumor, ask your healthcare provider what you can expect.
Management and Treatment
How do healthcare providers treat benign soft tissue tumors?
A small soft tissue tumor that isn’t causing issues may not require treatment. Providers typically do surgery to remove benign soft tissue tumors that cause issues like pain or that affect organ function.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
In general, benign soft tissue tumors don’t cause significant health issues. But large tumors that press on nerves and organs may cause issues. In that case, providers may recommend surgery to remove the tumor.
Prevention
Can I prevent a benign soft tissue tumor?
Unfortunately, you can’t prevent most benign soft tissue tumors. What you can do is be aware of changes in your body that may be signs of a soft tissue tumor. While most soft tissue tumors are benign (noncancerous), some are cancerous. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have a lump or bump that doesn’t go away.

How do I take care of myself?
The best thing you can do is be aware of changes in your body. Talk to a healthcare provider if you notice new lumps or bumps that appear to grow.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
You may want to ask the following questions:
What kind of benign soft tissue tumor do I have?
Why did I develop this tumor?
Could this tumor become cancerous?
What are the treatments?
Can the tumor come back after treatment?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Questionable lumps and bumps are among the top reasons people visit healthcare providers. Sometimes, those lumps and bumps are benign soft tissue tumors. These tumors aren’t cancer but they can affect your quality of life. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have a lump or bump that doesn’t go away. You may not need treatment, but knowing a lump or bump isn’t cancer will give you peace of mind.
