Treatment Details
What are examples of energy healing?
There are many types of energy healing techniques.
Reiki
“Rei” is a Japanese word that means “higher power.” “Ki” means “life force energy.” Put together, Reiki means a life-force energy guided by a higher power. Energy healers use a higher power or spirit to channel energy through your body. They place their hands either lightly on or hovering over your body. They focus their attention and allow energy to flow through their hands into your body. This joins together your body and mind, leading to natural healing.
Acupuncture
Acupuncture
is a type of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). An energy healer inserts very thin steel needles through your skin into
acupressure points
on your body. Common areas include your head, neck, face and back. The goal of this method is to stimulate these points to rebalance your energy flow. This can relieve pain and other symptoms.
Pranic healing
“Prana” is a Sanskrit word that means “life force.” It’s the invisible energy that surrounds your body. Pranic healing is a form of non-touch treatment. An energy healer scans your body for signs of blockages in your aura. Then, they remove these blockages by scattering fresh energy over you. This recharges your body to help treat physical disease.
Qigong
“Qi” is a Chinese word that translates to “vital energy.” “Gong” means “training.”
Qigong
is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that uses body movement and breath. Its goal is to improve the flow of qi through your body. This can lower your blood pressure, reduce pain and help improve your sleep. It can help you maintain optimal physical and mental health.
Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)
Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)
is a type of exposure therapy or counseling. A therapist finds 12 acupressure points on your body and taps on them. At the same time, you focus on a negative emotion while repeating
positive thoughts
to yourself. This process can balance your energy field. You can also learn where your acupressure points are and tap yourself.
Therapeutic Touch (TT)
Despite its name, Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a non-touch healing treatment. An energy healer centers themselves into a focused state of consciousness. Then, they pass their hands over your body to find imbalances in your energy field. They clear your life force of any blockages. This rebalances your energy field.
Polarity Therapy (PT)
Polarity Therapy (PT) uses body movement and changes to your daily habits to release blockages in your energy field. This restores balance. An energy healer manipulates your body by gently touching and applying pressure to specific areas. You also practice daily yoga and develop a
mindful relationship with the food
you eat.

Quantum Touch (QT)
Energy healers who practice Quantum Touch (QT) believe your body is smart and has a natural ability to heal itself. QT involves three steps to influence your energy flow and restore health. First, the healer lightly touches your body where you have pain. Then, you practice certain
breathing techniques
. Finally, you pay attention to any changing sensations in your body.
Reflexology
With
reflexology
, an energy healer applies pressure to acupressure points on your hands, feet and ears. This can help relieve pain and reduce stress in your body. With a focus on these specific parts, they’re pushing energy through 12 pathways in your body. These pathways run through nerve endings to your muscles, glands and internal organs. By stimulating these pathways, they’re able to rebalance your body’s energy flow.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Energy healers believe a subtle energy runs through your body. When something knocks this energy out of alignment, they believe energy healing therapies can help restore balance in your body. Energy healing is noninvasive and comes with little risk. But research hasn’t proven that it works. So, if you’re interested in this kind of medicine, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you explore your options while you continue to receive more traditional treatment.
