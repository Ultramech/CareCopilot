Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare disorder that’s often genetic. It occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough myelin, the protective covering over your nerves. As a result, people with this condition experience neurological symptoms. They may have trouble balancing or controlling their movements.

Overview
What is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare condition that’s usually genetic and affects your
brain
and
spinal cord
. It often causes problems with movement or muscle function.

Some people with PMD also experience developmental delays. PMD is progressive, meaning the symptoms worsen over time.
How does Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease affect my body?
PMD is a type of genetic disease called a
leukodystrophy
. Leukodystrophies are conditions that affect your
nervous system
’s white matter, including myelin, the protective covering over your nerves. In PMD, your body doesn’t create enough myelin.
Who does Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease affect?
PMD mostly affects
males
. It's an X-linked
genetic disorder
, meaning it occurs because of a mutation on one X chromosome.
Since females have two X chromosomes, they often have less severe symptoms. Or, they might not develop the condition at all.
What are the types of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
There are two types of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease:
Classic Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease
is most common. Symptoms develop in a baby’s first year of life. Classic PMD usually causes muscle and movement problems. People with classic PMD develop typical intellectual skills until around adolescence when development stops. People may slowly lose intellectual abilities after adolescence.
Connatal Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease
is less common and more severe. Severe movement problems, poor growth, feeding problems and seizures develop in infancy. People with connatal PMD typically never develop walking skills. Many also have difficulty speaking, although they can usually understand others.

How common is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is rare. In the United States, experts estimate that up to 1 in 200,000 males have it. It's even less common among females.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease symptoms may include:
Balance problems
.
Developmental delays
.
Feeding problems.
High-pitched breathing (stridor).
Involuntary eye movements (
nystagmus
).
Involuntary tensing or jerking movements (
dystonia
).
Poor weight gain.
Weak muscles (
hypotonia
).
What causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease usually occurs because of a change (mutation) in the
PLP1
gene. You inherit this gene mutation from one or both parents.
Up to 20% of males with PMD don’t have the
PLP1
gene mutation. Some of them have a mutation in the
GJC2
gene, or they may have PMD for no known reason.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease diagnosed?
Your child’s healthcare provider may suspect PMD based on symptoms. They may use tests to confirm the diagnosis, including:
Imaging tests,
such as
MRIs
, to see if your child has low amounts of myelin.
Genetic tests,
such as blood tests, to check for the gene mutation that causes PMD.
Management and Treatment
How is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease treated?
There’s no cure for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Treatment focuses on improving quality of life and may include:
Medications
to reduce muscle spasms or seizures.
Physical or occupational therapy
to increase balance, strength and motor control.
Eye treatments
such as glasses or surgery to correct involuntary eye movements.
Counseling
with a licensed mental health provider to increase healthy coping skills and deal with the emotional effects of having a genetic disease.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
The prognosis for PMD varies depending on how severe the symptoms are. Severe symptoms usually continue to worsen, leading to a shortened lifespan.
However, some people live a typical lifespan and have mild symptoms that don’t affect their daily activities very much. Your healthcare provider can help you understand how Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease may affect you or your child’s life.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
There’s no way to prevent Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. If you have PMD or think you could be a carrier for it, you may consider genetic testing.
A genetic test looks for the gene mutation that causes PMD. A genetic counselor can help you understand the test results, including the risk of passing PMD to your children.
Living With
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you or your child has Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease or you think you could, you may also want to ask a healthcare provider:
What is the most likely cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
What tests diagnose Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
What are the treatments for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease?
What are the chances that I’ll pass Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease to my children?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It may be overwhelming to learn your child has Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Treatment may vary depending on the type and severity of symptoms. Some people with PMD have mild symptoms that don’t significantly affect their abilities or lifespan. Talk with your healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that works for you and your family.
