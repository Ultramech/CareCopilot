Golfer’s Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis)
Golfer’s elbow, known medically as medial epicondylitis, is a form of tendonitis that causes pain and inflammation in the tendons connecting your forearm and elbow. When you repeatedly use your wrist and arm to bend, grasp or twist things, your tendons develop tiny tears that can cause wrist, elbow and forearm pain.

What is golfer’s elbow?
Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis ) is a form of tendonitis in the tendons connecting your forearm and elbow.
You don’t have to swing a golf club to develop golfer’s elbow. You can get golfer’s elbow, known as medial epicondylitis, from swinging a tennis racquet, hefting a loaded food tray, hammering nails or pounding away on your computer keyboard.

Golfer’s elbow is a form of
tendonitis
that causes pain and
inflammation
in the
tendons
connecting your forearm and elbow. When you repeatedly use your wrist and arm to bend, grasp or twist things, your tendons develop tiny strains that can cause wrist, forearm and
elbow pain
. Continued use of your wrist/arm while having pain can eventually lead to small tears in your tendon.
Left untreated, medial epicondylitis could possibly cause long-term problems like limiting your elbow’s range of motion,
chronic pain
and weakening of your grip.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of golfer’s elbow
Golfer’s elbow symptoms can take weeks or months to develop. They might start with pain in your inner elbow that seems worse first thing in the morning. Other symptoms include:
Aching pain in your forearm or wrist
Decreased grip strength
Numbness
in your hand
Pain when you try to make a fist
Radiating pain up and down your arm
Tingling in your hand
Golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis) usually affects your dominant arm. For example, right-handed people develop golfer’s elbow in their right arm.
Golfer’s elbow causes
Golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis) happens when you repeatedly use your wrist and arm to bend, grasp or twist things. Over time, the tendons that connect your forearm and elbow develop strains that lead to tiny tears, which can cause elbow, forearm and
wrist pain
.

Risk factors for medial epicondylitis
Your risk of developing golfer’s elbow increases if you:
Have
diabetes
Have
obesity
Smoke
Spend two or more hours a day doing repetitive actions
Diagnosis and Tests
How do doctors diagnose golfer’s elbow?
Your healthcare provider will ask what activities make your elbow hurt. They’ll examine your arm for specific movements and/or positions that cause pain. Other tests might include:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Ultrasound
Computed tomography (CT) scans
Management and Treatment
What’s the treatment for golfer’s elbow?
First, give your arm a break. Healthcare providers recommend you rest your arm for at least four to six weeks before playing sports or resuming the daily activities that put a strain on your arm.
Other golfer’s elbow treatments include:
Using ice on your forearm
Taking
anti-inflammatory medications
Wearing a brace on your forearm
Wearing a night
splint
Using kinesiology tape
Going to
physical therapy
Persistent golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis) pain that’s not significantly reduced by physical therapy might require additional treatment, including:
Massage
to stimulate nerve endings and pressure points to promote healing and reduce pain
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy
to stimulate blood flow and encourage healing by delivering high-energy sound waves
Topical nitroglycerin patches
to reduce inflammation
Corticosteroid injections
for short-term symptom relief
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
injections
to reduce pain and improve function
Prolotherapy
to jump-start your body’s healing process
Botulinum toxin (Botox®)
injections
to block nerve signals and reduce pain
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous
tenotomy
to repair damage to your tendons
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
to relieve pain
If you haven’t had any improvement of your symptoms with these methods over six to 12 months, your provider may recommend surgery, but this is rare.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your provider if you still have symptoms even after resting your arm and doing physical therapy.
Golfer’s elbow doesn’t usually require an emergency room visit. But your symptoms might be signs of a serious problem. Go to the emergency room or get immediate attention if:
Your elbow looks misshapen
Your elbow feels hot or inflamed, and you have a
fever
You think you’ve
broken a bone
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Some questions you may want to ask your provider include:
I don’t play golf. How did I develop golfer’s elbow?
What can I do about the pain?
Are there exercises I can do?
Will I need surgery?

What can I expect if I have this condition?
Fortunately, most people recover from golfer’s elbow without surgery. There are also simple steps you can take every day that can help your tendons heal.

Golfer’s elbow can be more than a nuisance that keeps you off the greens, away from the courts or off the job. Left untreated, golfer’s elbow could cause permanent damage like limiting your elbow's range of motion, causing chronic pain and weakening your grip. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have persistent elbow pain. They’ll treat the pain and recommend ways you can take care of your elbow without giving up your favorite activities.
