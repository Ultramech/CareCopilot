Lower Right Back Pain
Pain in the lower right section of your back can be caused by problems with your spine, the soft tissues of your back and underlying conditions. Because pain can spread from your organs to your back, you might have a problem with your appendix but feel the pain in your back. Lower right back pain should be reported to a healthcare provider quickly.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Keep a careful eye on your symptoms. You may want to keep a record of when you experience lower right back pain, how severe it is and if there are other symptoms along with it. This can help your healthcare provider diagnose and treat you.
Remember: The pain in the lower right part of your back can sometimes be as minor as a sprain that can be fixed with time and ice packs, but it can be as major as a spinal tumor. Report your symptoms to your healthcare provider so that they can give you the right diagnosis, and then the right treatment. If you don’t get treatment for pain caused by, for example, a kidney or liver problem, there could be permanent damage done to those organs.
