Orchitis
Orchitis causes pain and swelling in one or both of your testicles. The mumps, certain sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections are common causes. Treatment usually involves antibiotics. At-home care can also help relieve symptoms. You can help prevent orchitis by getting vaccines and using protection during sexual intercourse.

Overview
What is orchitis?
Orchitis (or-KY-tis) is swelling or
inflammation
of one or both of your
testicles
(testes). Your testicles are part of your
reproductive system
— they make reproductive cells (sperm) and
testosterone
, which is a
hormone
. Most
males
have two testicles.

What is the difference between orchitis and epididymitis?
Epididymitis
is a condition that causes swelling and inflammation in your epididymis. The epididymis is a tube at the back of your testicles that carries and stores sperm.
Epididymo-orchitis is when you have epididymitis and orchitis at the same time.
How common is orchitis?
Orchitis alone isn’t common — it usually appears alongside other conditions like epididymitis. When it does appear on its own, it usually results from a
mumps
infection.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of orchitis?
The main symptoms of orchitis are
testicular pain
, tenderness and swelling. The pain usually starts in one testicle. But it can spread to your other testicle or affect your entire scrotum. Your scrotum is the pouch of skin behind your penis that holds your testicles.
Other orchitis symptoms may include:
Feeling very tired (
fatigue
)
Signs of infection, including
fever
,
chills
and
headache
Discoloration in your scrotum (red, purple, brown or black)
Muscle pain
Nausea
and
vomiting
Blood in your pee (
hematuria
)
Pain when you ejaculate (dysorgasmia or orgasmalgia)
Blood in your semen (
hematospermia
)
Leaking fluid (discharge) from your
penis
Rapid heartbeat (
tachycardia
)
What is the main cause of orchitis?
Orchitis develops as a result of a
viral
or
bacterial infection
. Most cases occur because of:
Urinary tract infections
(UTIs)
Sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), including
chlamydia
,
gonorrhea
and
syphilis

Can you get orchitis without an STI?
Yes, you can get orchitis without an STI. Viral infections that can cause orchitis include:
Chickenpox
Cytomegalovirus
(CMV)
Hand, food and mouth disease
(HFMD)
Rubella
Bacterial infections that can cause orchitis include:
Escherichia coli
(
E. coli
)
Staphylococcus
(staph)
Streptococcus
(strep)
Prostate infections (
prostatitis
)
Epididymitis can also cause orchitis.
Who does orchitis affect?
Anyone who has testicles, at any age, can get orchitis. But the following factors increase your risk of developing orchitis:
Having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners
Autoimmune disease
, especially conditions that attack your sperm cells
Bladder outlet obstruction
, such as
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) or
urethral stricture
Using a
Foley catheter
Previous cases of epididymitis
What are the complications of orchitis?
Orchitis complications may include:
Scrotal
abscess
. Your scrotum may fill with pus. Pus is thick, usually yellow-white fluid that contains
white blood cells
, dead tissue and pathogens (
bacteria
or
viruses
).
Testicular atrophy
. Your affected testicle may shrink and lose function.
Hydrocele
. Fluid builds up in your scrotum.
In rare cases, if orchitis affects both of your testicles, it may lead to
infertility
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is orchitis diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will perform a
physical exam
to check for tenderness and swelling in your testicles. To confirm their diagnosis, they may also order additional tests.
What tests will be done to diagnose orchitis?
A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose orchitis:
Blood tests
,
urinalysis
(pee test) and/or
urine culture
. These tests check for bacterial and viral infections, including STIs.
Pelvic ultrasound
. This noninvasive imaging test measures blood flow to your testicles. It helps rule out
testicular torsion
, which cuts off blood flow to your testicles and causes sudden, intense testicular pain.
Management and Treatment
How do you get rid of orchitis?
Getting rid of orchitis depends on its exact cause. In Treatment options may include:
Antibiotics
. Antibiotics kill bacterial infections. If an STI causes orchitis, your sexual partners must also receive treatment. If they don’t, you may continue passing the STI to each other.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs)
. NSAIDs can help reduce pain and inflammation. Not everyone can take NSAIDs, so it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider before you take them.
Ice
. Apply ice or cold packs to help reduce pain and swelling. Don’t apply ice directly to your scrotum. Wrap ice or cold packs in a towel. Don’t apply ice for more than 15 minutes at a time.
Rest
. Lay down as much as possible. Put pillows underneath your hips and buttocks (butt) to elevate your scrotum. Wear a jockstrap to support and immobilize your scrotum when you must get up.

What antibiotics treat orchitis?
It depends on the exact cause of your orchitis. A healthcare provider may prescribe:
Cause
Antibiotic
Chlamydia
Doxycycline, Azithromycin
Gonorrhea
Ceftriaxone, Gentamicin, Azithromycin
Syphilis
Penicillin
E. coli
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Ciprofloxacin, Rifaximin
Staph
Cefazolin, Nafcillin, Vancomycin
Strep
Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Benzathine.
Prostatitis
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin
Cause
Chlamydia
Antibiotic
Doxycycline, Azithromycin
Gonorrhea
Antibiotic
Ceftriaxone, Gentamicin, Azithromycin
Syphilis

Penicillin
E. coli
Antibiotic
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Ciprofloxacin, Rifaximin

Strep
Antibiotic
Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Benzathine.
Prostatitis
Antibiotic
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin
Be sure to complete your entire course of antibiotics. If you don’t, orchitis may come back and be harder to treat.
What happens if orchitis is untreated?
Without treatment, you’re more likely to have complications or long-term damage, including severe illness, infertility or the loss of a testicle.
How long does it take for orchitis to clear up?
Orchitis symptoms typically start to go away a few days after you start treatment. But it can take weeks or even months for the swelling to go away completely.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have orchitis?
With proper diagnosis and treatment, the outlook for orchitis is good. Infertility and other long-term problems are rare.
How long does bacterial orchitis last?
In most cases, it takes about a week for antibiotics to clear a bacterial infection. You should avoid having sexual intercourse for at least seven days. If you have intercourse, use condoms to protect your partner(s) from infection.
Prevention
Can orchitis be prevented?
You can reduce your chances of developing orchitis by getting the
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine
and wearing
condoms
during sexual intercourse. If you’re sexually active and have multiple partners, it’s also a good idea to get an
STI test
at least every three to six months.

When should I see a healthcare provider?
Reach out to a healthcare provider if you have orchitis symptoms. Contact a provider if you receive treatment for orchitis and your symptoms don’t start to go away after you finish your full course of medication.

What questions should I ask a healthcare provider?
Questions you may want to ask your provider include:
What caused orchitis?
Do I have epididymo-orchitis?
What treatment do you recommend?
Are there any steps I can take to ease my symptoms?
Should I look out for signs of complications?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Orchitis causes testicular pain and swelling. It can cause a lot of feelings, including anxiety, embarrassment and even anger. Many feel nervous at the idea of even talking to a healthcare provider about problems they have with their sensitive areas out of fear of being judged or feeling vulnerable. However, a provider will do their best to make you feel comfortable during an examination and any necessary testing to diagnose and treat orchitis.
If an STI causes orchitis, you should notify any sexual partners so they can talk to a provider and get treatment, too. You may have swelling in your testicles for a few months, but the pain should diminish. You can help reduce any other discomfort at home with rest and ice.
