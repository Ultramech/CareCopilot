How do you become a psychiatric nurse practitioner?
To become a PMHNP, you first need to attend nursing school to become an
RN (registered nurse)
. You can earn either your ADN (associate’s degree in nursing) or BSN (bachelor of science in nursing) from an accredited nursing program. If you earn your ADN, you’ll need to then complete your BSN degree or enter into an accelerated RN to MSN (master of science in nursing) program, which lets you earn your BSN and MSN at the same time.
To officially become an RN, you’ll need to pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) — the test you need to take to become a nurse.
After you pass the NCLEX, you can choose to gain some nursing experience or go directly into an MSN program that offers a path to becoming a PMHNP. There are many in-person and online degree programs available. If you already have your nurse practitioner (NP) degree, you can get a certificate in PMHNP instead. These are certificate programs that allow nurse practitioners to further specialize in mental health.

Once you’ve become a PMHNP, you can get certified. The American Nurses Credentialing Center offers a certification in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP-BC).
How long does it take to become a PMHNP?
There are many different steps to becoming a PMHNP. First, it takes several years to earn your BSN. Then, it’s important to gain work experience in the nursing field before entering a nurse practitioner program. There’s a lot of variability in the length of NP programs, so be sure to consider the length of each program as you decide which will work best for you.
What is the difference between a psychiatrist and a PMHNP?
Psychiatrists
and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners have similar roles and responsibilities. They both provide therapy services, prescribe medication and manage the mental health of their patients. But the educational paths of a psychiatrist and a PMHNP are quite different.
A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who attends medical school for at least four years and completes a fellowship in psychiatry. A PMHNP is a type of nurse practitioner who attends nursing school and completes an advanced nursing program with a specialty in psychiatry. Psychiatric nurse practitioners use the nursing process to inform how they practice.
