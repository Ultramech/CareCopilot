But if that itch doesn’t go away and interferes with your quality of life, you may need to see your healthcare provider for treatment.

Diagnosis and Tests
What tests are done to diagnose itchy genitals?
Itchy genitals are a symptom of various conditions and infections. Your healthcare provider may have to examine your skin for the following:
The color of your skin (red, white, brown).
A change in the texture of your skin (thickening, thinning).
Surface changes in your skin (dryness, scales, flaking, oozing).
Your healthcare provider may need to confirm a diagnosis by scraping off part of your skin and looking at it under a microscope or sending it to a laboratory.
What questions might my healthcare provider ask to diagnose itchy genitals?
When you visit your healthcare provider to determine why your genitals are itchy, they may ask:
Where’s your itch located?
How often do you need to scratch?
Are you able to stop scratching?
How bad is your itchiness?
Does it keep you awake at night
?
Have you had any new sexual partners?
Have you changed laundry detergents or dryer sheets recently?
Management and Treatment
What medicines treat itchy genitals?
The treatment for itchy genitals depends on the cause. If you have eczema, your healthcare provider may prescribe topical steroid creams.
Lichen sclerosus
and lichen simplex chronicus are treated with topical steroids. If steroid creams aren’t effective for lichen sclerosus, it may respond to
phototherapy
(light therapy). Your provider will recommend antifungal medications for jock itch or a yeast infection. Sometimes lifestyle changes, like changing detergents or changing your underwear more frequently, can help with mild genital itching.

dermatologist

Additional Common Questions
Why do my private parts itch at night?
Having itchier skin at night is common because that’s the time of day when changes to your body temperature and increases in blood flow to your skin occur. Your skin also loses water at night, making your skin extra dry and prone to itch. Additionally, you’re more aware of these itchy sensations because you’re trying to relax and get some sleep. Since you’re distracted by work, activities and other events throughout the day, you may not be as aware of the itchiness.
Your healthcare provider may recommend an
antihistamine
at bedtime to help you rest.
