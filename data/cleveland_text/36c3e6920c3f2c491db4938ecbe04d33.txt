also causes more serious conditions when it infects wounds, including
gas gangrene
and anaerobic cellulitis.
How common is
Clostridium perfringens
food poisoning?
Food poisoning
from
C. perfringens
is common. About 1 million people in the U.S. get sick from food contaminated with
C. perfringens
each year.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of
Clostridium perfringens
food poisoning?
Stomach cramps and watery diarrhea are common symptoms of
C. perfringens
food poisoning. It usually doesn’t cause vomiting or fever. Symptoms start six to 24 hours after you eat contaminated food.
What causes
Clostridium perfringens
?
Bacteria cause
C. perfringens
food poisoning. When you eat food contaminated with the bacteria, they release toxins into your gastrointestinal tract (intestines). The toxins cause inflammation (
enteritis
), leading to diarrhea and cramping.
How do you get
Clostridium perfringens
food poisoning?
You can get
C. perfringens
from eating food that’s been sitting out, even if it’s just for an hour or two.
C. perfringens
can create spores, which are like a protective suit that allows bacteria to survive extreme conditions, like heat or cold. These spores can’t reproduce, but they can contaminate food, even after it’s cooked. The bacteria then reproduce again when the food gets cool (between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, or 4 and 60 degrees Celsius) for an hour or longer without being rewarmed or refrigerated.

What foods can be contaminated with
C. perfringens
?
C. perfringens
is most commonly found in gravies, red meat (beef, pork) and poultry (chicken, turkey). It’s less common in fish and vegetables.
What are the complications of
C. perfringens
food poisoning?
C. perfringens
food poisoning rarely leads to complications. But there’s a small risk of serious illness, including:
Dehydration.
Diarrhea can cause you to lose fluids faster than you’re able to replace them. Drinking water and broth can prevent dehydration, especially if you have mild diarrhea. If you have severe diarrhea or vomiting, you may need to see a healthcare provider so they can help you stay hydrated.
Sepsis.
If
C. perfringens
gets into your bloodstream, it can quickly destroy blood cells and cause sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening reaction to infection. It’s a very rare complication of food poisoning.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is
Clostridium perfringens
diagnosed?
Providers usually diagnose food poisoning based on your symptoms. If they need to test you, you’ll provide a stool (poop) sample. Your provider will send your sample to a lab, where they’ll test it for
C. perfringens
and other germs that can make you sick. If there’s an outbreak of sickness, health officials may test food to find the source of the bacteria.
Management and Treatment
How is
Clostridium perfringens
food poisoning treated?
There’s no specific treatment for food poisoning caused by
C. perfringens.
It usually goes away on its own within a day or two. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
If you’re very sick, your provider will treat you with
antibiotics
. This usually isn’t necessary.

How do I take care of myself?
Anytime you have diarrhea or are throwing up, it’s important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Fluids that help you stay hydrated include:
Water.
Sports drinks.
100% fruit juices with water added.
Broth.
Oral rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte®).
What should I eat/drink with
