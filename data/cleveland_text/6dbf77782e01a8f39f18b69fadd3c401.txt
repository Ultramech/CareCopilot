Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a rare type of breast cancer. It accounts for 15% of all breast cancer cases. Unlike most breast cancer types, triple-negative breast cancer cells don’t have the receptors or proteins that help cancer grow and spread. This makes TNBC challenging to treat. Medical researchers are studying new treatments.

What Is Triple-Negative Breast Cancer?
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a rare type of invasive
breast cancer
. It affects about
13 in 100,00 women
in the U.S.

The name triple-negative refers to the difference between TNBC and other types of breast cancers. Breast cancer cells have receptors for
estrogen
and
progesterone
. They also have receptors for HER2. This is a protein that manages breast cell growth.
Receptors on cells act like locks that only certain substances can open. Most common breast cancer medications target receptors. TNBC cells don’t have increased expression of receptors. That means that certain drugs that work to treat other types of breast cancer aren’t as effective if you have TNBC. But recent research shows combining certain cancer drugs may help people live longer with triple-negative breast cancer.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of triple-negative breast cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer symptoms include:
A new
lump
or mass in your
breast
Breast pain
or nipple pain
Dimpled breast skin
Nipple discharge
A
nipple
turning inward
Nipple or breast skin that’s dry, flaking, thickened or red
Swelling in all or part of your breast
Swollen lymph nodes
under your arm or near your collarbone.
Having certain symptoms doesn’t mean you have breast cancer. But don’t hesitate to talk to a healthcare provider if you notice changes in your breasts. It’s also important to have regular mammograms that may detect cancer before it causes symptoms.

Triple-negative breast cancer causes
Researchers don’t know the exact cause. But there’s a connection between TNBC and
mutations
in the
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
genes. These genes keep cancer from growing. Cancer can develop when genes change for unknown reasons.
Risk factors
Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to affect
females
who are:
Age 40 and younger
Inherit
BRCA
gene changes
Black or Hispanic
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose triple-negative breast cancer
A healthcare provider will examine your breast. They’ll ask if you’ve noticed changes in your breasts. They’ll do tests including:
Mammogram
Breast MRI
Breast ultrasound
A
surgical oncologist
or a radiologist will do a
breast biopsy
if imaging tests detect cancer. They’ll do the biopsy to get breast tissue samples. A medical
pathologist
will examine the tissue under a microscope. They’ll check the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2).
They may do another test to identify any
germline mutations
. These are mutations that occur in a parent’s reproductive cells (egg or sperm). They change the genetic material that the child receives from their parents (hereditary). You can inherit germline mutations from either parent.
Your cancer care team will use test results to set a
cancer stage
. Cancer staging information helps them plan treatment.
Triple-negative breast cancer stage
Cancer location
Stage 0
There are cancer cells in your breast ducts, but the cancer hasn’t spread to other areas of your breast.
Stage I
There are cancer cells in nearby breast tissue.
Stage II
Cancer cells have formed a small tumor. Tests detect cancer in your underarm lymph nodes. The tumor may measure 2 centimeters (about ¾ inch) across or less. Or it may be 5 cm (about 2 inches) across but not in your lymph nodes.
Stage III
Your care team may call this locally advanced breast cancer. In Stage III TNCB, there’s cancer in nearby tissue and lymph nodes.
Stage IV
Cancer spreads to areas away from your breast.

Management and Treatment
Treatment
Breast cancer surgery
is a common treatment for triple-negative breast cancer. Your oncologist may combine surgery with cancer treatments like:
Chemotherapy
to treat early-stage (Stage I or Stage II) cancer
Immunotherapy
and chemotherapy to shrink cancerous tumors before surgery
Radiation therapy
after surgery to reduce the chance that cancer will
come back
(recur)
Targeted therapy
, including
PARP inhibitors
or
antibody drug conjugates
, to treat TNBC that involves
BRCA
genetic mutations in select situations
Triple-negative breast cancer is the focus of many
clinical trials
. These are research studies where experts test potential treatments. A clinical trial may be a chance to receive new drugs or new combinations of drugs. You may want to ask your cancer care team if a clinical trial makes sense for you.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Breast cancer surgery can cause complications like surgical wound infection or
blood clots
. Contact your cancer care team if you have infection symptoms like:
Fever (greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.4 degrees Celsius)
Pus draining from the surgical wound
Redness or skin discoloration that goes beyond the edge of the incision
Blood clot symptoms include a swollen leg that hurts or trouble breathing. You should also contact the team if cancer treatment side effects are more severe than you expected.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the triple-negative cancer survival rate?
The overall relative five-year survival rate is
78%
, according to the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. A relative survival rate compares people with the same type and stage of cancer to people in the overall population. In this case, the TNBC overall survival rate means females with TNBC are, on average, about 77% as likely as females who don’t have TNBC to live for at least five years after receiving a diagnosis.
Cancer survival rates
are overviews of people’s experiences with cancer. The rates estimate the percentage of people with a specific cancer diagnosis who are alive after a certain time — usually one to five years — after they receive a diagnosis.
The rates don’t predict how
long you’ll live
with cancer. Survival rate information can be confusing and cause concern. If you have questions, your oncologist will explain what a survival rate means in your situation.
Is there anything I can do to feel better?
Breast cancer treatment can be
exhausting
. Here are some suggestions that may help:
Gentle activities like walking and yoga may ease the
stress
that a cancer diagnosis can cause. And activity may help ease your symptoms.
Eat well
. Fill your plate with lean protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. And stay hydrated. Research suggests that staying at a weight that’s healthy for you may help support breast cancer treatment.

And talk to your cancer care team if you have treatment side effects that are more severe than you expect. They’ll do everything they can to support you during your treatment.
Ask them about
palliative care
or
cancer rehabilitation
programs. These programs help people with cancer manage symptoms and side effects.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Triple-negative breast cancer is a challenging disease. Treatments that are effective against other types of breast cancer don’t have the same impact on TNBC. That can be discouraging news. But new combinations of anticancer drugs show promise. And researchers are checking even more new combinations with the goal of doing more to treat triple-negative breast cancer. If you have this type of breast cancer, your cancer care team will explain your treatment options. They’ll also answer your questions about potential new treatments.
