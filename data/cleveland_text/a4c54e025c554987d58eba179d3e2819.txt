Viral Arthritis
Viral arthritis can cause pain and swelling in your joints when you have a viral infection. It’s an uncommon symptom that comes and goes when the infection does. Unlike other types of arthritis, it’s usually not long-lasting and doesn’t seriously harm your joints. You can usually treat it with over-the-counter pain medications.

What is Viral Arthritis?
Viral arthritis is joint pain and swelling that comes with a viral infection in your body. So, you'll have symptoms of a virus as well as arthritis.
Viral arthritis is when you have
arthritis
— pain, inflammation and swelling your
joints
— that comes from a
viral infection
. It’s a temporary condition that develops quickly, often over a few hours or days, along with other symptoms of the infection. It goes away on its own as the other symptoms go away.

Policy
Viral arthritis is:
Inflammatory
. Unlike
degenerative arthritis
, inflammatory arthritis happens because your
immune system
is activated. Your immune system produces
inflammation
to fight the
virus
.
Acute
. Unlike many types of inflammatory arthritis, viral arthritis is a short-term reaction. Even if your infection lasts longer, viral arthritis usually goes away after the initial immune response.
Generalized
. You’ll feel it in multiple places because it comes from general inflammation in your body. It’s different from
infectious arthritis
, which is when you have an infection in your joint.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of viral arthritis
The main symptoms of viral arthritis are pain, swelling and stiffness in your joints. You may also have other symptoms related to the type of viral infection you have. Common symptoms include:
Fever
Joint pain
Joint swelling
Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
Swollen lymph nodes
Viral exanthem rash
Viral arthritis causes
You may develop viral arthritis from:
Arboviruses, including
chikungunya
,
dengue virus
and
zika virus
Hepatitis viruses (
B
and
C
)
Herpes viruses, like
Epstein-Barr
,
herpes simplex
and
varicella-zoster virus
HIV
HPV
Mpox
Respiratory viruses, including
adenovirus
,
COVID-19
,
mumps
,
parvovirus

Can vaccines cause viral arthritis?
Vaccines
don’t cause viral arthritis. But some of the vaccines that prevent viral infections can produce a short-term immune response that feels similar to viral arthritis. Vaccines that may cause this include:
MMR vaccine
HBIG vaccine
HPV vaccine
Risk factors of viral arthritis
You may be more likely to get viral infections — and to develop complications like viral arthritis — if you:
Have a
compromised immune system
. Certain chronic diseases and medications that suppress your immune system can make it harder for your body to fight off viral infections.
Are more frequently exposed to viruses
. If you travel abroad often, work in a healthcare setting or use intravenous drugs, you may be exposed to viruses more often than average.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose viral arthritis
If you develop sudden joint pain that’s unusual for you, a healthcare provider will physically examine you. They’ll look for signs of inflammation in your joints and take note of any other symptoms you have. They’ll often recognize viral arthritis by the signs and symptoms of arthritis and viral infection.
Many viruses only cause short-term infections that go away by themselves. If your symptoms are mild, there may be no need to identify which virus you have. But some infections do need quick treatment.
Blood tests
can help your provider identify these infections and rule out other conditions, if necessary.
Management and Treatment
How is viral arthritis treated?
Most people with viral arthritis can treat it with over-the-counter
pain relievers
, like
NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
. Some infections, like
viral hepatitis
or HIV infections, may need treatment with antiviral medications. These
antivirals
will often relieve viral arthritis, as well.
When should I contact my healthcare provider?
If you develop sudden joint pain and swelling, especially with other symptoms of illness, you might have viral arthritis. A healthcare provider can confirm it and determine what kind of treatment you need. Be sure to follow their instructions and let them know if you develop any new or worsening symptoms.

Prevention
What can I do to reduce my risk of viral arthritis?
You can reduce your risk of viral arthritis by protecting yourself from viral infections. You should:
Avoid injecting drugs with needles (unless directed by a healthcare provider)
Drink clean water
Get any vaccinations your healthcare provider recommends
Practice
safe sex
Prevent
mosquito bites
Outlook/Prognosis
What can I expect if I have viral arthritis?
Viral arthritis is generally brief and mild. It doesn't cause long-term damage to your joints, and it resolves shortly after your infection clears. This may be a matter of days or weeks, depending on the virus you have. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about what you can expect in your case.

Occasionally, some infections can become chronic infections. In this case, it’s possible (though uncommon) to have repeat episodes of viral arthritis when symptoms of the infection flare up. Some people with chronic infections later develop chronic types of arthritis. These are different from viral arthritis.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Some viruses that can infect your body can also cause arthritis symptoms. This makes your joints achy and swollen, on top of your other symptoms. It’s not fun, but it’s not serious or long-lasting like other types of arthritis are. You can treat it with over-the-counter medications until the infection clears.
