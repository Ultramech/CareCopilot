It commonly spreads through skin-to-skin contact or contact with a flake of skin. It spreads in areas used by large groups of people, like locker rooms, swimming pools and saunas.
It can also spread through contact with an infected surface. You can get athlete’s foot by sharing towels, socks or shoes with someone who has athlete’s foot.
Is athlete’s foot contagious?
Athlete’s foot is contagious. It’s a fungus that grows on or in your skin. Fungi (plural form of fungus) need warm temperatures and moisture to grow. People often wear socks and tight shoes every day, which keep their feet warm and moist. This is the perfect environment for athlete’s foot to grow.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is athlete’s foot diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider can typically diagnose athlete’s foot by examining your feet and symptoms.
What tests will be done to diagnose athlete’s foot?
In some cases, your healthcare provider may remove a small piece of skin (biopsy) and test it in a lab. Several drops of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution dissolve the skin cells so only fungal cells are visible.
Management and Treatment
How do I treat athlete’s foot?
Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription antifungal creams, ointments, gels, sprays or powders effectively treat athlete’s foot. These products contain
clotrimazole
,
miconazole

fluconazole
,
itraconazole

How do I manage my athlete’s foot symptoms?

How soon after treatment will I feel better?
With proper diagnosis and treatment, your athlete’s foot should go away in one to eight weeks. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions.
It’s important to finish your full course of medicine. During the early healing stages, itchiness and irritation will fade. Even if your symptoms go away, you may still have athlete’s foot. If you don’t finish your full course of medicine, your athlete’s foot can come back and be harder to treat.

Nails
: Fungal nail infections can be more difficult to treat. They’re often more resistant to many treatments.
Hands
: A similar fungal infection can spread to your hands. This happens when you scratch your infected feet or use the same towel to dry off your infected feet and hands.
Groin
