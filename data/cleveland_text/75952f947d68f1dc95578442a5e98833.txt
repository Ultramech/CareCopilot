Chronic Hives (Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria)
Chronic hives (chronic urticaria) are red, itchy skin welts that last more than six weeks. Many people have these welts every day for a year or longer. People with certain autoimmune diseases are more prone to chronic hives. But often, the cause of chronic hives is unknown. Antihistamines, steroids and immunosuppressants can soothe the hives.

Chronic:
A symptom or condition that persists even with treatment.
Idiopathic:
The symptom or condition occurs for no known reason. It comes on suddenly.

The medical term for hives, pronounced ur-tik-CARE-ee-uh.
What are hives (urticaria) and angioedema (swelling)?
Hives (urticaria) and angioedema (swelling)
can occur together. Hives are raised red bumps or splotches on your skin. Angioedema (swelling) may occur in deep layers of tissue. This swelling can affect your face, lips, throat, hands, feet and genitals.
What’s the difference between hives and chronic hives?
Chronic hives are different than acute hives:
Acute hives
start to fade within 24 hours (although new hives may replace them). They are gone within six weeks. A recent viral infection often causes acute hives.
Chronic hives
are visible at least twice per week for more than six weeks. Some chronic hives last for months or years. The cause is often unknown.
How common are chronic hives?
Up to 5% of people develop chronic hives. The condition can affect anyone,  but is more common in women ages 30 to 50.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes chronic hives?
For most people with chronic hives, there’s no known cause. Rarely,
medication allergies
or
food allergies
cause chronic hives. The most common allergic cause is something you consume on a regular basis. Other types of allergies may also bring on chronic hives.

Celiac disease

Allergists.
Dermatologists
.
Primary care physicians.
How are chronic hives (chronic urticaria) diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider can diagnose chronic hives by examining your skin and learning more about your symptoms.
Diagnostic tests for chronic hives can pinpoint or rule out causes. You may get one or more of these tests:
Allergy test
to see if an allergen is causing a reaction.
Blood test
to check for high levels of antibodies, proteins that help your body fight off bacteria, allergens and other substances.
Urine test
to look for bacterial infections.
Skin biopsy procedure
to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for other causes.
Management and Treatment
What are chronic hives treatments?
Treatments for chronic hives include:
Allergy medications:
Daily over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription
allergy medications
like antihistamines relieve itching and reduce or prevent allergic reactions.
Allergy shots:
A monthly injection of a drug called omalizumab (Xolair®) blocks your body’s production of immunoglobin E (IgE). People with severe allergies can make too much IgE, leading to problems like chronic hives and asthma.
Steroids:
Corticosteroids
like prednisone (Deltasone®, Rayos®) can ease symptoms that don’t respond to allergy medicines.
Hydroxychloroquine:
A study found that 8 in 10 people with autoimmune disease-induced chronic hives got symptom relief after taking hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®), an antimalarial drug, for three or more months.
Cyclosporine:
This immunosuppressant is highly effective at clearing up severe chronic hives. But it can cause serious side effects when taken for too long.
