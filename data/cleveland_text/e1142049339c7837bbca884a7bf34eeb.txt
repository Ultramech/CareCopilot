Additional Common Questions
How long does it take to become an occupational therapist?
All occupational therapists in the United States must be licensed and certified. They’re required to have a bachelor’s degree from an undergraduate college or university and a master’s degree in occupational therapy.
It usually takes six to seven years to become an occupational therapist. Most occupational therapists take four years to complete an undergraduate degree, then two or three years to earn their master’s degree.
In the U.S., all occupational therapists must pass an exam administered by the National Board of Certification in Occupational Therapy before they’re allowed to practice. Some states have additional examination or licensing requirements.
What is the difference between an occupational therapist vs. a physical therapist?
Occupational therapists and physical therapists are both healthcare providers who help you move your body. The biggest difference between them is the type of therapy they perform.
An occupational therapist will work with you to overcome mental and social challenges. They’ll help you accomplish all your routine tasks and do your favorite activities safely.
Physical therapists
usually treat a specific area or part of your body. They’ll help you improve your physical mobility or manage symptoms like pain or stiffness.
You might work with both an occupational therapist and physical therapist at the same time to manage different symptoms or help your recovery.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Working with an occupational therapist is an ongoing process. It’ll take time and adjustments for them to find the right interventions and therapies that help you accomplish your goals. Be honest with your occupational therapist about your goals — tell them which activities you want to do. They’ll do their best to find ways to help you reach your goals while feeling stronger and safer throughout your day.
