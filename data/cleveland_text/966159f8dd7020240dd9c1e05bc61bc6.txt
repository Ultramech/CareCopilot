Mycoplasma
Mycoplasmas are a unique type of bacteria that can cause infections. Mycoplasmas don’t have cell walls, so common antibiotics like penicillin won’t effectively kill them. Some infections don’t need treatment. But if you do, your healthcare provider will prescribe a special kind of antibiotic that can destroy the bacteria and make you feel better.

What Is Mycoplasma?
Mycoplasma is a bacterium (singular form of
bacteria
) that can lead to
bacterial infections
. Different types of mycoplasmas target specific areas of your body, including your
lung (respiratory) system
and
urinary system
, as well as your genitals. Mycoplasmas that cause lung infections are the most common type.

Mycoplasmas are unique because, unlike other bacteria, they don’t have cell walls. Standard
antibiotics
destroy most bacteria by weakening their cell walls. Since mycoplasmas don’t have cell walls, those antibiotics don’t work on them. While most mycoplasma infections will go away on their own, healthcare providers will sometimes use special antibiotics to kill the bacterium and get you feeling well again.
Types of mycoplasma
There are three main types of mycoplasma that cause bacterial infections:
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
:
This type of mycoplasma causes lung infections known as “
walking pneumonia
” because symptoms appear as a chest cold or mild
pneumonia
that doesn’t usually require hospitalization.
Mycoplasma genitalium
:
This mycoplasma lives in your reproductive organs and can spread through sexual intercourse. Most symptoms are similar to those of a
sexually transmitted infection
, including pain during sex and discharge from your
vagina
or
penis
.
Mycoplasma hominis
:
This bacterium lives in your urinary tract and genitals. It can cause infections in people with weakened
immune systems
. The bacterium can also pass from parent to child during childbirth, particularly in
premature babies
.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of mycoplasma infections
Some mycoplasma infections don’t cause symptoms. You may not even know you have an infection at first. If you do have mycoplasma symptoms, they may last from just a few days up to a month. Symptoms may appear two to three weeks after exposure to the bacterium. The most common symptoms of
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections include:
Abnormal
lung sounds
Dry cough
Fatigue
Fever
Headache
Shortness of breath
Sore throat
Rarely, you may develop a type of mycoplasma
rash
. This skin condition can range from mild redness to severe, painful
blisters
.
Mycoplasma infection causes
Mycoplasma is a contagious bacterium.
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
easily spreads from an infected person to others nearby in tiny droplets that become airborne after a cough or sneeze. Respiratory mycoplasma infections are contagious for an average of 10 days.
Risk factors
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections can affect anyone. But certain risk factors increase your chances of developing the condition, including:
Age
:
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections most commonly affect children between the ages of 5 and 17.
Certain health conditions
: Having a preexisting lung condition, like
asthma
, or a weakened immune system, can cause an infection.
Living in group environments or spending time in crowded settings
:
These includes schools, residence halls, hospitals, nursing homes and correctional facilities.
Complications of mycoplasma infections
Complications of a mycoplasma infection may include:
Asthma attacks
Empyema
Encephalitis
Hemolytic anemia
Kidney
problems
Pleural effusion
Severe pneumonia
Skin diseases, like
Stevens-Johnson syndrome
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose mycoplasma infections
Your healthcare provider will perform a
physical exam
and ask you about your symptoms. They’ll ask about your medical history and whether you live or spend time in a crowded environment. You may need a
chest X-ray
to confirm a
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infection. Sometimes, providers request other imaging tests, like
CT scans
.
Tests that are used to diagnose mycoplasma infections
Several lab tests can help your provider diagnose or confirm a mycoplasma infection. These include:
PCR test
(polymerase chain reaction test)
:
A swab collects fluid, often from your nose or throat, to detect genetic material from mycoplasma.
Serology test
:
This test looks at a sample of your blood for
antibodies
to see if your immune system is fighting a mycoplasma infection.
Coombs test
: This test looks for antibodies that can harm your
red blood cells
.
Management and Treatment
Mycoplasma treatment
Some mycoplasma infections resolve on their own, so treatment isn’t always necessary, especially if you have very mild symptoms. You can take over-the-counter (OTC) medications to relieve your symptoms if you’re congested or have a cough.

If you think you have a more severe infection, talk to your healthcare provider about mycoplasma treatment options. They may prescribe you an antibiotic that can effectively kill the bacteria.
While many antibiotics are ineffective at destroying mycoplasma bacteria, the macrolide class of antibiotics can usually eliminate them. These antibiotics include:
Azithromycin
Clarithromycin
Erythromycin
Other possible antibiotic options include a
tetracycline
, like
doxycycline
. If you’re immunocompromised, your provider may recommend fluoroquinolone (
levofloxacin
).
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
After you begin antibiotics, your symptoms will often decrease after two to three days. But respiratory infections may take weeks to completely resolve. Contact your healthcare provider if you still feel sick or have symptoms after you’ve completed your antibiotics.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you experience symptoms that persist, like cough and fever, or worsening symptoms like
wheezing
, visit your healthcare provider for treatment.
If you have difficulty breathing or a high fever that lasts more than a couple of days, go to your nearest emergency room immediately.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a mycoplasma infection?
Infections from mycoplasma bacteria vary based on the type and location of the infection in your body.

Your healthcare provider may test for the type of bacteria that caused your infection. Treatment should help you start to feel better after a few days. Some symptoms may persist after you finish treatment but should go away in a few weeks.
How long does a mycoplasma infection last?
With antibiotics, your symptoms should start to fade after a couple of days. If you have
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
, your cough could last a few weeks after you’ve finished your antibiotics.
Prevention
Can mycoplasma infections be prevented?
There’s no
vaccine
to prevent mycoplasma infections, and the bacteria are highly contagious. But you can take steps to protect yourself and others from the bacteria by:
Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
Practicing good hygiene and
washing your hands
often with soap and water
Staying home if you’re sick or wearing a mask to prevent it from spreading
Taking doctor-prescribed antibiotics as instructed
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Mycoplasma is a highly contagious bacterium that can cause bacterial infections. While the condition usually isn’t too serious, you still want to keep an eye on your symptoms. Any symptoms that don’t go away or seem to be getting worse should be checked out by a healthcare provider. They can prescribe you a specific kind of antibiotic that destroys bacteria without cell walls. You may have to try a couple of different antibiotics until you find one that works, but you should feel better soon.
