Parotidectomy
Parotidectomy is surgery to remove all or part of the parotid gland. This is a major salivary gland in front of your ear. Surgeons remove part or all of the gland while protecting the facial nerve. This procedure treats tumors and other conditions that affect your parotid gland. It’s done under general anesthesia.

Overview
What is a parotidectomy?
A parotidectomy is surgery to remove all or part of your
parotid gland
. Parotid glands are major
salivary glands
in front of your
ears
. They make
saliva
(spit) that helps you swallow food. This procedure is treatment for
tumors
or a
salivary stone
that blocks your salivary gland.

Types of parotidectomies
Healthcare providers classify parotidectomies by the part of the gland that the disease affects. Your parotid gland has two sections separated by your
facial nerve
. This nerve manages your facial expressions and movement. Types of parotidectomies are:
Superficial parotidectomy
: Surgery to remove a tumor in the superficial section on top of your facial nerve
Total parotidectomy
: Surgery to remove a tumor in the deep section below your facial nerve or a tumor in both sections
Both types may be treatment for salivary gland stones.
Treatment Details
How should I prepare for this procedure?
Your
otolaryngologist
will give you specific instructions. In general, you should:
Quit smoking
Ask your surgeon if there are medications or supplements you should stop taking before surgery
Find out when you should stop eating or drinking before surgery
Ask if you’ll need to stay in the hospital after surgery or go home the same day
Plan to have someone drive you home and care for you during the first 24 hours after surgery or for a few days after surgery
You may feel a bit overwhelmed by what you need to do to get ready for a parotidectomy. You might want to have a family member or friend with you when you meet with your surgeon. They can take notes while you and your surgeon discuss what you should do to get
ready for surgery

You may have the following tests before surgery if you have a tumor in your parotid gland:
Fine-needle aspiration
to get a small piece of tissue from your parotid gland (a medical
pathologist
will check the sample to see if the tumor is cancerous)
CT scan
or
MRI scan
if the tumor is close to your facial nerve (the scans help your surgeon plan the best way to protect your facial nerve while they remove the tumor)
What happens during a parotidectomy?
Your
anesthesiologist
will give you general anesthesia through an IV. You’ll be asleep during surgery. Then, your surgeon will:
Make an incision (cut) in front of your ear — the cut goes down to the area below your ear lobe and reaches back and down into the natural crease in your upper neck
Pull back skin so they can see your parotid gland — they may use a facial nerve monitoring device during surgery, which lets your surgeon check on your facial nerve
Remove all or part of your parotid gland — they’ll also remove any nearby lymph nodes if tests show there’s cancer in those lymph nodes
Close the incision
Insert a small tube (
surgical drain
) to catch any blood or fluid that collects at the surgical wound
The surgery will take about two to four hours.
What are the potential benefits and risks of a parotidectomy?
A parotidectomy may
cure
a benign (noncancerous) tumor in your parotid gland. It’s effective treatment for severe salivary stones and infections. The surgery may cure parotid gland cancer by removing a cancerous tumor before it can spread. But cancerous tumors may
come back
.
This is a major surgery because it involves removing part of your parotid gland. Complications from a parotidectomy include:
Numbness
in your ear, face or jaw that may last three to four months up to a year
Facial weakness that may last a few weeks or months up to a year after surgery
Frey’s syndrome
(sweating when you eat), which may develop several months after surgery
First bite syndrome
, which is when you have severe pain when you take your first bite of food
There are potential risks, including:
Allergic reaction to pain medicine
Damage to a nearby organ during surgery
Excessive fluid collecting at the surgery site
Excessive
bleeding
Hematoma
(blood collecting at surgery site)
Parotidectomies may cause the following side effects:
Pain and swelling at the surgery site (lasting about one to three weeks)
Discomfort in your jaw when you’re eating (can last up to two to four weeks)

Recovery and Outlook
What happens after?
You’ll wake up in a recovery room. A healthcare provider will check your
vital signs
. They’ll give you pain medication. They may ask you to smile or close your eyes so they can confirm your facial nerve works like it should.
Your
care team
will explain how to take care of your
surgical wound
and surgical drain when you go home. They’ll tell you when you’ll need to come back so a provider can remove the surgical drain and sutures. Timing varies, but you may see a provider:
Advertisement
One to two days after surgery to remove the surgical drain
Five to seven days after surgery to remove non-absorbable sutures
Four to six weeks after surgery, when your surgeon will check to confirm the surgical wound is healing
What is the recovery time?
Recovery typically takes a few weeks. Most people will be able to get back to their usual activities after about two weeks. It may take a few months up to a year for you to recover from any numbness or facial weakness.
Parotidectomy follow-up care
Cancerous parotid gland tumors can come back. You may have regular checkups for up to 20 years after your surgery. A typical checkup schedule may look like the following:
Post-treatment timeline
Check up schedule
Year 1
Every one to three months
Year 2
Every two to six months
Year 3 to 5
Every four to eight months
Year 5 and beyond
Every 12 months

support may help you manage anxiety and stress.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Contact your surgeon if:
You have pain that doesn’t go away with medication
Your face feels numb or weak
There’s pus, fluid or blood coming from the surgical wound
The area around it feels warm to your touch or it hurts when you touch it
The surgical wound smells bad
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A parotidectomy is surgery to treat conditions that affect your parotoid gland, like a tumor or salivary stone, by removing all or part of the gland. Often, surgery cures parotid gland conditions. But a cancerous parotid tumor can come back. You may need regular checkups and tests for up to 20 years after your surgery.

Your care team understands the stress and anxiety that can crop up before, during and after your checkup. They’ll take time to explain test results and any new treatment you may need.
