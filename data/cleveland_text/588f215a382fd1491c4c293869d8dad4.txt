Overview
What is hypertonic pelvic floor?
Hypertonic pelvic floor is a condition where the muscles in your lower pelvis are in a spasm or state of constant contraction. This can be temporary or constant. When your pelvic floor muscles are in this state, they can’t relax and coordinate the control of certain bodily functions. This causes pain (either constant or with certain activities), problems with urination (peeing) and bowel movements (pooping) as well as
sexual dysfunction
and
painful intercourse
.

The muscles of your pelvic floor connect to your pelvic bones to form a strong, yet flexible foundation. They span between the:
Pubic bone in the front.
Lower spine (sacrum) in the back.
Sit bones on each side.
Nerves and muscles in your pelvic floor help control urination, bowel movements and sexual function.

painful bladder syndrome
.

Stress, depression and anxiety.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is hypertonic pelvic floor diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. This may include questions about your bowel movements, urination and sexual activity. You may find these topics difficult to talk about, but it’s important to be open about any problems you're having. This will help your provider make an accurate diagnosis.
Your provider will also likely do a physical exam. This may involve:
Visual inspection of your pelvic area, including a check of how well you contract and relax your pelvic floor muscles.
Digital rectal exam to check your rectum and anus.
Pelvic exam to check your vagina.
Other tests your provider may perform include:
Anorectal manometry
:
During this test, your provider inserts a thin tube (catheter) with a balloon at the end into your rectum. As the balloon inflates, the muscles in your rectum and anus contract. The catheter is attached to a machine that records these contractions and relaxations and measures pressures in your sphincter.
Electromyography
:
This procedure uses surface electrodes to measure the electrical signals of your muscles as they relax and contract. Electrodes are held to your skin with adhesive pads.
Defecography
:
This test allows your provider to check your bowel movements. It involves placing a thick barium paste (special contrast that is seen on X-ray) into your rectum. You’ll then be asked to poop on a special toilet while X-ray pictures are taken. This test requires taking some bowel prep similar to colonoscopy to clean out your rectum and colon prior to the test.
Urodynamic tests:
This is a set of tests usually performed together that show how well you urinate (pee) and how your bladder works.

to treat constipation and evaluate your pelvic floor.
Colorectal specialist for pelvic floor disorders related to bowel movements (pooping).
Gynecologist
to treat reproductive health problems in women.
Urologist
