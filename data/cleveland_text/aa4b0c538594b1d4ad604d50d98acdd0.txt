Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between a respiratory doctor and a pulmonary doctor?
Generally, a respiratory doctor and a pulmonary doctor are the same. But you might hear people use the term “respiratory doctor” when they mean a
respiratory therapist
, an
allergist
, or a
thoracic surgeon
. All of these are medical specializations that can manage different aspects of lung and airway conditions.
What’s the difference between a cardiologist and a pulmonologist?
The difference is the area of specialization. A
cardiologist
is an expert on the heart and cardiovascular diseases, while a pulmonologist is an expert on the lungs and respiratory diseases.
But your heart and lungs work together closely. If you have a condition like pulmonary hypertension, you may need to see both a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, since both your heart and lungs are involved.
How do you become a pulmonologist?
In the U.S., it takes several years of education and hands-on experience to become a pulmonologist. You’ll need to:
Complete a bachelor’s degree, usually in an area related to medicine (like biology).
Pass the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) to get into a medical school.
Earn a medical degree (this takes about four years).
Complete a basic three-year residency program in internal medicine. (Pulmonary medicine is a subspecialty of internal medicine.)
Complete two years of a fellowship in pulmonary disease, and often an extra year in critical care medicine.
Become board-certified by the American Boards of Internal Medicine and Pulmonary Medicine.

You can also get board certification in pulmonary disease and critical care (treating serious illnesses in intensive care units in hospitals). You’ll have to complete a three-year fellowship that covers both areas. The American Board of Internal Medicine can grant certifications in each area.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Most of us never think about our breathing — until we have a problem with it. Whether you have a nagging cough that just won’t go away, or you’re feeling breathless when you never did before, respiratory conditions can severely impact your quality of life. Sometimes, these conditions are serious or lifelong. Sometimes, they’re manageable if you find the right treatment.
This is where a pulmonologist comes in. They’re trained to know exactly how your respiratory system works and how to investigate conditions that can cause symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. They can help you manage ongoing conditions and improve your quality of life. If you’re not sure whether you should see a pulmonologist, your primary care physician, family doctor or another trusted healthcare provider can talk you through your options.
