Tailor's Bunion (Bunionette)
Tailor’s bunions (bunionettes) are painful, bony growths that develop where your pinkie toe meets your foot. Most people can manage them with nonsurgical treatments like changing the type of shoes they wear or taping their toes back to their natural position. Your podiatrist might suggest surgery if a bunionette makes it hard for you to walk.

Overview
Tailor’s bunions develop on the outside edge of your pinkie toe joint — the fifth metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.
What is a tailor’s bunion?
A tailor’s bunion is a bony bump that forms at the base of your pinkie (little) toe where it meets your foot.

Healthcare providers sometimes call them bunionettes because they’re like smaller versions of
bunions
that form at the base of your big toe.
Tailor’s bunions develop on the outside edge of your pinkie toe joint — the fifth metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The fifth MTP joint is where your pinkie toe meets the base of your foot.
They get their name from the way that tailors used to sit while they worked. Traditionally, lots of tailors sat cross-legged with the outside edges of their feet pressed into the ground or their chairs. This extra pressure made them much more likely to develop bunionettes.
You’ll probably be able to see and feel a tailor’s bunion on your foot. Visit a healthcare provider or
podiatrist
if you’re experiencing pain, stiffness or other symptoms in your feet.
Symptoms and Causes
What are tailor’s bunion symptoms?
The most obvious symptom of a tailor’s bunion is the bony growth at the base of your pinkie toe. Some people don’t experience any other symptoms, especially if the bunionette is small or newly formed.
If you do have tailor’s bunion symptoms, you might experience:
Foot pain
in your pinkie toe or the outside of your foot.
A feeling of pressure, especially when you’re wearing shoes.
Swelling.
Discoloration or redness.
Corns or calluses
(thickened skin) on your pinkie toe.

A tailor’s bunion can push your toes out of their natural alignment and make your pinkie toe crooked or bent in toward your other toes.
What causes a tailor’s bunion?
Extra pressure on your pinkie toe or your fifth MTP joint causes tailor’s bunions. When something puts pressure on your pinkie toe joint for a long time (usually years), that pressure can push your joint out of its natural alignment and toward your other toes. Eventually, a bunionette forms on your fifth MTP joint when your body compensates for your toe being pushed out of place.
The most common causes of extra pressure on your pinkie toe joint include:
Wearing narrow or pointed shoes that crowd your toes (shoes with a narrow toe box).
The way you walk (your foot mechanics).
Health conditions that cause inflammation (like
rheumatoid arthritis
or
lupus
).
Standing for a long time or working on your feet.
Risk factors
Anyone can develop a tailor’s bunion. Certain groups of people who are more likely to have one include:
Women
.
People whose biological parents have any type of bunion or issues with their foot mechanics. More than 70% of people with bunions have a biological parent who’s had them.
People with a history of foot injuries (including athletes).
What happens if a tailor’s bunion is left untreated?
If a tailor’s bunion isn’t treated or corrected, it’ll continue to get worse over time. The bony growth will get bigger, and it’s more likely to cause symptoms like pain or swelling.
Having a bunionette may increase your risk of other conditions that affect your toes, including:
Bursitis
.
Hammertoes
.
Foot arthritis
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose tailor’s bunions?
A healthcare provider will diagnose a tailor’s bunion with a
physical exam
. They’ll examine your toes and foot and ask about your symptoms. Tell your provider when you first noticed a bump near your pinkie toe and if certain activities make your symptoms worse.
Your provider might order a
foot X-ray
to take pictures of your foot bones. An X-ray will show the bunionette’s bony growth and how much it’s affecting your toe’s natural alignment.
Management and Treatment
What are tailor’s bunion treatments?
Your healthcare provider or podiatrist will suggest treatments that relieve the extra pressure on your pinkie toe and prevent the tailor’s bunion from growing bigger. The most common bunionette treatments include:
Footwear changes:
Switching to shoes with wide, deep toe boxes can take pressure off your toes. You may be able to use a stretching device to widen shoes you already own.
Bunion pads and taping:
Over-the-counter (OTC) bunion pads cushion the area around a tailor’s bunion to relieve pressure. Your provider might suggest using medical tape to hold your toes in the correct position.
Orthotic devices:
Orthotics are shoe inserts that support your feet. You might need over-the-counter orthotics or custom-made inserts. Your provider might suggest placing a spacer between your toes.
Pain relievers:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) reduce pain and swelling. You might need pills you take by mouth or topical NSAIDs (creams or ointments you rub into your skin around a tailor’s bunion). Don’t take NSAIDs for more than 10 days in a row without talking to your provider.
Icing:
Applying ice or cold packs to your pinkie toe may help, too. Wrap a cold pack in a thin towel to avoid putting it directly onto your skin.
Corticosteroids:
Corticosteroids
are prescription medications that reduce inflammation.
Surgery:
Your provider may recommend
bunion correction surgery
if other treatments don’t relieve your symptoms or walking is extremely painful. Your provider or surgeon will tell you which type of surgery you’ll need and what to expect.

How do I get rid of a tailor’s bunion?
Bunion correction surgery is the only way to remove a tailor’s bunion completely.
You don’t necessarily need a bunionette surgically removed to feel better. Most people can manage their symptoms without surgery. Your provider or podiatrist will usually only suggest surgery to remove a bunionette if it’s causing severe symptoms that affect your ability to move or walk.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a tailor’s bunion?
Most people who have a tailor’s bunion can manage their symptoms without surgery and with no long-term impacts on their daily routine. Your provider will work with you to find a combination of treatments that relieve your symptoms and keep your feet and toes healthy and strong.
Even if you do need surgery to remove a tailor’s bunion, you should be able to resume all your usual activities within a few months.
Don’t wait to see a provider if you notice a new bump or growth on your foot, especially if it’s painful, swollen or discolored. The sooner you start treatment, the less likely you’ll experience severe symptoms or complications.
Prevention
Can I prevent tailor’s bunions?
Some tailor’s bunions develop for reasons you can’t change, so you might not always be able to prevent them. But wearing well-fitting shoes is the best way to prevent tailor’s bunions (and lots of other foot and toe issues).

Follow these tips to find comfortable shoes that fit your feet properly:
Avoid shoes with narrow, pointed tips — especially if they fit tightly on your toes.
Even if you know your size, try on a few pairs of shoes to make sure you’re getting the best fit. Labeled shoe sizes aren’t always the same between brands and styles.
Sit, stand and walk in new shoes before buying them. Make sure no movement or position hurts, pinches or pushes on your toes.
Trying shoes on at the end of the day may give you a more accurate fit (your feet naturally swell slightly over the course of a day and are bigger later in the day than first thing in the morning).
Your provider or podiatrist can recommend types or brands of shoes that will work well for your feet. Ask your provider if you need orthotics to prevent bunionettes if you have other structural foot issues like
flat feet
or
high arch feet
.

Additional Common Questions
How do you shrink tailor’s bunions naturally?
The term “natural” doesn’t have a set medical definition, but most people with tailor’s bunions can treat them without surgery.
There’s no way to shrink a tailor’s bunion other than having it surgically removed. Remember, there’s nothing “unnatural” about needing surgery to treat any medical condition, including a tailor’s bunion. The best treatment for you is the one that works and gets you back to your usual routine.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It might be confusing to learn that you have a tailor’s bunion when you don’t even own a sewing machine. Whether or not you know how to repair ripped jeans or fix a loose button, a tailor’s bunion can be a painful, annoying development.
Don’t discount your symptoms, even if they’re minor. You shouldn’t have to live with constant foot pain, swelling or other issues that make you uncomfortable. Visit a healthcare provider or podiatrist if your feet are bothering you, especially if you notice a new growth near the base of your pinkie toe.
