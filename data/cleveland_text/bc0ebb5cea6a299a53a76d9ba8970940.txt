Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare cancer. It causes cancerous tumors that can affect muscles, ligaments, tendons and other soft tissue in your body. There are more than 70 types of soft tissue sarcoma. You can have a soft tissue sarcoma for months or years before you have symptoms. Treatment is surgery to remove the cancerous tumor.

What Is Soft Tissue Sarcoma?
Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare cancerous tumor that affects muscle, ligaments or other types of soft tissue.
“Soft tissue sarcoma“ is an overarching term for rare,
cancerous tumors
in your soft tissues. You have soft tissues everywhere in your body, including your:

Blood vessels
Body fat
Ligaments
Lymphatic vessels
Muscle
Nerves
Tendons
Soft tissue sarcoma typically affects your arms, legs, chest and the back of your belly (retroperitoneum). Adults are more likely than children to have a type of soft tissue sarcoma.
Types of soft tissue sarcoma
There are more than 70 different types of soft tissue sarcoma. Some types, like liposarcoma, have several subtypes. Types of soft tissue sarcoma are:
Angiosarcoma
: This disease forms in the inner lining of your blood cells and lymphatic vessels. It’s a very aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma.
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors
:
These are tumors in the lining on the inside of your abdomen and
pelvis
.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)
: This type of soft tissue tumor develops in your
digestive system
.
Leiomyosarcoma
: This disease affects your smooth muscle. This type of tumor often develops in your belly.
Liposarcoma
:
This tumor can develop in your legs or your retroperitoneum.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
:
These are tumors that form in layers of tissue protecting the nerves in your
peripheral nervous system
.
Malignant
schwannomas
:
These are slow-growing tumors. They can affect nerves in your arms, legs or your lower back.
Myxofibrosarcoma
:
This soft tissue tumor may develop in fat or cartilage that’s right under your skin.
Rhabdomyosarcoma
:
These tumors affect muscles in your arms, legs, head, neck and belly. Children and teenagers are more likely to have this cancer than adults.
Synovial sarcoma
:
This type of tumor may form in your joints, belly, arms, legs or
lungs
.
Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
: This is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma. It typically forms in your arms and legs.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma?
Most soft tissue sarcomas grow very slowly. You can have one for months or years before you have symptoms. You should contact a healthcare provider if you have:
A new
lump
or a fast-growing lump anywhere on your body
A lump that starts to hurt
Belly pain
that gets worse
Blood in your poop or
poop
that appears black
Nausea
and
vomiting
Unexplained weight loss
Soft tissue sarcoma causes
Experts don’t know the exact cause.
Genetic mutations
cause some soft tissue sarcomas. There are also inherited disorders and activities that increase your risk of having this condition. For example, some inherited disorders can increase your risk, including:
Gardner syndrome
Hereditary
retinoblastoma
Li Fraumeni syndrome
Lynch syndrome
Maffucci syndrome
Neurofibromatosis type 1
(von Recklinghausen disease)
Other risk factors include:
Receiving
radiation therapy
Experiencing
lymphedema
in your arms or legs for a long time
Having exposure to chemicals, including thorium dioxide, arsenic or vinyl chloride
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose soft tissue sarcoma
A healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms. They’ll examine any unusual lumps or bumps that they can see and feel. They’ll do a
physical exam
to look for other symptoms. They may do the following imaging tests:
X-ray
CT scan
MRI
PET scan
Your provider may refer you to a
surgical oncologist
if imaging tests detect cancer. Your surgical oncologist may do a
biopsy
to get a small amount of tissue.
A medical
pathologist
will examine the tissue under a microscope. They may do several tests to identify the sarcoma type, stage and grade. Tumor grade is how pathologists find out if a tumor is likely to grow slowly, fast or
spread
.
What are the stages?
Healthcare providers use
cancer staging
systems to develop treatment plans and prognoses (what you can expect if you have soft tissue sarcoma). They consider the following factors in staging soft tissue sarcoma:
Tumor size and location
If the tumor is spreading to other areas of your body
Tumor grade (this is how pathologists determine if a tumor is likely to grow and/or spread)
Management and Treatment
How is soft tissue sarcoma treated?
The most common treatment is surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. Your surgical oncologist may work with a medical oncologist. That provider may do additional treatments like:
Chemotherapy
I
mmunotherapy
Targeted therapy
Radiation therapy
You may want to consider participating in a
clinical trial
. Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare kind of cancer. Researchers are investigating new ways to treat it. Participating in a clinical trial may be a way to benefit from newer treatments. Ask your provider if seeking a clinical trial makes sense in your situation.

Is there a cure?
Surgery that removes soft tissue sarcoma before it spreads may cure the disease. But soft tissue sarcoma can
come back
after surgery and other kinds of treatments.
When should I seek care?
You should contact your healthcare team if you experience the following symptoms after your surgery:
An
opening
in the incision line (the line may get deeper, longer or wider)
Fever
(greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.4 degrees Celsius)
Pain when you touch the wound or the area around the incision
Skin discoloration
that goes beyond the edge of the incision
Thick, cloudy, white- or cream-colored discharge from the incision (cut)
And talk to your care team if treatment side effects are more severe than you expect. They may recommend
palliative care
. This is specialized care. Palliative care providers can work with you to ease treatment side effects.
Will I need follow-up care?
Yes. Some types of soft tissue sarcoma come back. Your healthcare provider may recommend regular follow-up tests. They may do these tests for the first two to three years after you finish treatment.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the life expectancy of someone with soft tissue sarcoma?
Life expectancy
is how long you’ll live with soft tissue sarcoma. Your care team can’t predict that. But they may offer to explain soft tissue sarcoma survival rates.
Cancer survival rates
are estimates based on the experiences of people who have cancer. The estimates are presented as the percentage of people who are alive five years after their cancer diagnosis.

The National Cancer Institute tracks
cancer survival rates
based on how far cancer has spread at diagnosis. Here are estimated survival rates for people who have soft tissue sarcoma:
Cancer location at diagnosis
Five-year survival rate
Localized (cancer hasn’t spread from where it started)
83%
Regional (there’s cancer in nearby lymph nodes)
60%
Distant (cancer has spread to more distant parts of your body)
17%

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Having a rare cancer like soft tissue sarcoma may make you feel as if you’re on an unfamiliar road. You don’t have a map and there’s no one around to point you in the right direction.
Your healthcare team will understand if you have many questions and concerns. They’ll do everything they can to help you find answers. They’ll explain your diagnosis in terms you understand. They’ll also outline treatment options. This information will help you feel confident about treatment decisions. It can also help plan the steps you’ll take after treatment.
