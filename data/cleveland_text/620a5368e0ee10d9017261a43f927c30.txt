How do I know if a hot tub is safe?
Pools and hot tubs need regular maintenance, including application of certain chemicals (chlorine) to keep them clean and healthy for users. But you can’t tell that a hot tub is clean and safe just by looking at it. If possible, ask the person who maintains the hot tub how often they clean and check it. A hot tub that’s monitored daily should be a safe choice.
How can I avoid getting hot tub folliculitis?
You can’t always know if
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
is present in a hot tub you’re using. But you can take steps to keep yourself safer:
Don’t shave or use any hair removal methods (such as hair removal creams or wax) right before you get in a hot tub.
Remove your bathing suit and take a shower as soon as you leave the hot tub.
Wash your bathing suit before wearing it again.
