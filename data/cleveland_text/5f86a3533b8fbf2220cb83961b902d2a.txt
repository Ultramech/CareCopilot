Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of psoriasis in the ears?
Symptoms of psoriasis in the ears include:
Itchy skin
.
Skin discoloration.
Scales or flakes.
Dry skin
.
If scales build up in your ear canal, they can block it, which can affect your hearing and cause pain and discomfort. You might also experience weeping psoriasis, which occurs as a result of a skin infection. This can cause painful oozing and crusting around the plaque on your skin.
What causes psoriasis in the ears?
An overactive immune system that creates a buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of your skin causes psoriasis in your ears. Your immune system keeps your body healthy by preventing foreign invaders like bacteria from harming your cells. During a flare-up of psoriasis symptoms, your immune system targets your healthy skin cells and mistakes them for a foreign invader. This causes your cells to copy and replace themselves too soon. As a result, these dead skin cells rise to the surface of your skin and cause symptoms of psoriasis.
Can psoriasis in the ears cause hearing loss?
A buildup of dead skin cells can collect in your ear and block your ear canal. This can cause
hearing loss
.
Additionally,
psoriatic arthritis
, which is a type of psoriasis, can target your inner ear and cause hearing loss and potential side effects like:
Dizziness
.
Vertigo
.
Tinnitus
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is psoriasis in the ears diagnosed?
A healthcare provider or a
dermatologist
will diagnose psoriasis in the ears. The provider will examine your skin and review your complete medical history. Psoriasis can run in families, so your provider might ask questions about your biological family’s medical history. A physical exam usually leads to an accurate diagnosis, but your symptoms can look similar to other skin conditions. Tests are available to rule out other conditions or to confirm a diagnosis via a
skin biopsy
.
If psoriasis in the ears affects your hearing, you may need to visit an ear, nose and throat specialist.
Management and Treatment
How do I get rid of psoriasis in my ears?
Treatment for psoriasis in your ears focuses on relieving your symptoms and preventing scales from building up in your ear canal, which can lead to hearing loss. It can be challenging to treat psoriasis in your ears, as your skin is sensitive. Treatment for psoriasis could include:
Topical creams or ointments.
Phototherapy
.
Oral medications.
Biological treatments.
Are there side effects of the treatment?
It’s important that you don’t stick anything in your ears if you have psoriasis in your ears. This could include cotton swabs or your fingers. Your affected skin can flake off and fall into your ear canal, which can get stuck and cause hearing loss. A healthcare provider will give you instructions and tips on how you can manage the symptoms in your ears to prevent complications.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have psoriasis in the ears?
Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that causes symptoms to flare up unexpectedly throughout your life. There isn’t a cure for psoriasis, but treatments are available to help you manage your symptoms.

Talk to a provider about treating your symptoms to help you feel better sooner. If your symptoms flare up frequently in these areas of your body, you might find comfort in visiting a mental health provider to help you improve your self-confidence.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
While psoriasis in your ears is rare, psoriasis is a chronic condition and symptoms can unexpectedly affect different parts of your body. If you get symptoms on, inside or around your ear, try your best not to scratch or stick your fingers inside of your ear. This could push dead skin cells into your ear canal and can lead to hearing loss. A healthcare provider will help you manage your symptoms so you can feel better sooner.
