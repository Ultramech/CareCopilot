Hemorrhage
A hemorrhage is bleeding from a damaged blood vessel. Many things can cause bleeding inside and outside of your body. Types of hemorrhages range from minor (like a bruise) to major (like bleeding in your brain). If you can’t stop external bleeding or suspect internal bleeding, get immediate medical help.

Overview
What is a hemorrhage?
A hemorrhage is a loss of
blood
from a damaged
blood vessel
. The bleeding can be “trapped” inside your body (internal hemorrhage). Or it can flow outside of your body (external hemorrhage) from a wound or body opening (orifice). The blood loss can be minor or major.

Most hemorrhages are medical emergencies.
Types of hemorrhages
You have blood vessels throughout your entire body, so there are many different types of hemorrhages. Some examples include:
Hemothorax
: This is when blood collects in the space between your
lungs
and rib cage (pleural space). It can compress your lung(s) and cause difficulty breathing or chest pain.
Intracranial hemorrhage (brain bleed)
: This is uncontrolled bleeding inside your
brain
or within the layers between your brain and skull. It’s called a
hemorrhagic stroke
when the bleeding is in your brain. This kind of
stroke
is especially severe and can get worse quickly. It’s different from an
ischemic stroke
, which means there’s a blockage of blood flow in your brain.
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)
: This is severe
vaginal bleeding
after childbirth. It’s a serious condition that can lead to death. It can occur right after delivery or up to 12 weeks after delivery.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
: This is bleeding in the area between your brain and the thin tissues that cover and protect it. SAH is a medical emergency.
Subconjunctival hemorrhage
: This is bleeding in the whites of your eye. The blood is trapped in your
conjunctiva
. It’s one of the few types of hemorrhages that usually aren’t serious.

Bruises
(bleeding under your skin) are also examples of hemorrhages (usually minor). Another related word is a hematoma — a pooling of blood in the tissues.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of hemorrhaging?
The way hemorrhaging makes you feel varies a lot depending on where it is and how severe it is.
Healthcare providers consider up to 15% of blood volume loss as a Class I hemorrhage. People with this amount of blood loss generally don’t have symptoms.
A Class II hemorrhage is a loss of 15% to 30% of your total blood volume. The first signs of this level of blood loss may include:
Dizziness
or lightheadedness (due to
low blood pressure
).
Fatigue
and weakness.
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
and increased breathing rate.
Increased heart rate (
tachycardia
).
Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you or someone near you has these symptoms.
Losing more than 30% of your total blood volume can lead to severe symptoms and complications, like:
Confusion
.
Seizures
.
Loss of consciousness.
Hypovolemic shock
.
Specific symptoms of internal hemorrhage
Specific symptoms of internal hemorrhage in certain areas of your body include:
Head
:
Sudden onset severe headache
,
vision
changes, confusion and weakness on one side of your body.
Chest
: Difficulty breathing,
chest pain
and
coughing up blood
.
Abdomen
: Swelling or a feeling of fullness, abdominal bruising and
bloody vomit
,
pee
or
poop
.
Bones
,
joints
and
muscles
: Bruising, swelling and pain. Increased pressure in tissues due to bleeding in a closed space is a medical emergency. It can compress
nerves
and blood vessels, leading to permanent loss of function.
Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you or someone near you has these symptoms.
How do you know if you’re hemorrhaging?
Sometimes, it can be hard to know how much blood loss is too much. For example,
nosebleeds
are common and often harmless. But if the bleeding is from a major blood vessel or artery, it can be severe and difficult to stop. The same goes for postpartum vaginal bleeding. This is an expected part of childbirth. But excessive bleeding is a sign of postpartum hemorrhage, which can be life-threatening.
The best things you can do are to be aware of your body and symptoms and to always seek medical help if you’re unsure if you’re bleeding too much. Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of excessive blood loss, like dizziness, fatigue and breathing issues. Don’t hesitate to get medical help if you’re concerned about blood loss.
What causes hemorrhages?
Damage to one or more blood vessels can lead to a hemorrhage. The severity of a hemorrhage often depends on where it is in your body and how big the blood vessel is.
Many conditions and situations can cause a hemorrhage or significantly increase your risk for one, including:
Alcohol use disorder
. This is a significant risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Blood clotting disorders
, like
antiphospholipid syndrome
.
Blood disorders
, like inherited
hemophilia
and
Von Willebrand disease
.
Cancer
.
Certain medications, like
warfarin
(Coumadin®),
aspirin
(including baby aspirin),
Clopidogrel
(Plavix®) and
apixaban
(Eliquis®).
Certain
vascular (blood vessel) diseases
, like
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
and
aneurysms
.
Complications from medical procedures, like surgery.
Damage to an internal organ, like an
ulcer in your stomach
from painkillers like
ibuprofen
(Advil®).
Injuries, like cuts, long
bone fractures
or
traumatic brain injury
.
Trauma, like gunshot or knife wounds.
Viral hemorrhagic fevers
. These are a group of illnesses caused by
viruses
that damage your blood vessels and can cause severe bleeding. Examples include
Ebola
,
dengue fever
,
Marburg
and
yellow fever
.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is a hemorrhage diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose a hemorrhage based on symptoms (like dizziness) and signs (high heart rate and low blood pressure). The next steps involve finding its location and what’s causing it. While external bleeding is often obvious, internal bleeding can be more difficult to find.
A provider will do a
physical exam
and assess your symptoms and medical history. They may need to do imaging and laboratory tests.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for a hemorrhage?
Treatment for a hemorrhage depends on:
Where it is and if it’s internal or external.
Its severity.
The underlying cause.
If you have other conditions or injuries.
If there’s an unknown cause and/or the bleeding is severe, you’ll need treatment in a hospital. Your healthcare team will find the cause and treat it appropriately. You may need:
Surgery.
Vitamin K injections
(to help stop bleeding if it’s caused by medication like warfarin).
IV fluids
.
Blood transfusions
.
First aid for external hemorrhage
You may be able to provide first aid for someone — or yourself — in cases of severe external bleeding. Follow these steps:
Call 911 or your local emergency services.
Lay the person down. If their limb is injured, raise it above the level of their heart, if possible.
If you have access to medical supplies, cover the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth.
Have the person apply direct pressure to the wound with their hand(s). If they can’t, do it yourself. If an object is embedded in the wound, don’t remove it. Apply pressure around it.
Use a tourniquet (if you know how) as a last resort for severe bleeding only.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for someone with hemorrhaging?
If you have a hemorrhage, your prognosis (outlook) depends on several factors, like:
The kind of hemorrhage.
Its severity.
How quickly you got treatment.
Your age and overall health.
Quick medical treatment is key to a better outlook. Once you receive treatment, your healthcare team will give you a better idea of what to expect going forward.
Possible complications of hemorrhages
Complications of hemorrhages happen due to decreased blood flow to your organs. This can ultimately lead to tissue and cell death, causing complications like:
Organ failure
.
Seizures.
Coma
.
Death
.
Hemorrhage is a leading cause of potentially preventable death, especially in people who have trauma injuries.
Specific types of hemorrhages can have certain complications. For example, a brain hemorrhage can lead to permanent brain damage and neurological issues. Postpartum hemorrhage can cause
Sheehan syndrome
, which is damage to your
pituitary gland
from excessive blood loss.
Other general complications of hemorrhages include rebleeding and complications related to hospitalization, like deep
venous thrombosis
and infection.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your blood is meant to stay inside your blood vessels. When it leaks out, it can cause major issues, especially if the blood loss is severe. When it comes to hemorrhages, quick medical treatment is key. Don’t hesitate to go to the hospital if you or a loved one has external bleeding that won’t stop or suspected internal bleeding.
