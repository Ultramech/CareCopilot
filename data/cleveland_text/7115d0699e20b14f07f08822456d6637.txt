Scurvy is a disease caused by a serious vitamin C deficiency. Not eating enough fruits and vegetables is the main cause of the disease.

Vitamin C deficiency can occur due to a diet low in vitamin C. But a deficiency severe enough to cause scurvy is rare in the U.S. because most people get enough of the nutrient in their diet. The condition is a problem in countries around the world where people are malnourished.
What is vitamin C?
Vitamin C
(ascorbic acid) is a very important nutrient for your body. It’s responsible for the development, growth and healing of your skin, bones and connective tissue. In addition, you need vitamin C for your blood vessels to function properly. Vitamin C helps maintain your teeth and gums. It helps your body absorb iron, which it needs to make red blood cells. Vitamin C also helps heal burns and other wounds.
Vitamin C is an
antioxidant
, meaning it protects your cells against damage from free radicals. Free radicals are byproducts of normal cell activity which participate in chemical reactions within cells. Some of these reactions can cause damage over your lifetime.
Who does scurvy affect?
In the U.S., scurvy most commonly affects babies, children and older adults who don’t get enough vitamin C in their diet. Risk factors for developing the condition include:
Not having access to fresh fruits or vegetables.
Eating very little due to medical treatments that make you feel sick (such as
chemotherapy
) or an eating disorder (such as
anorexia
).
Smoking
, which reduces the amount of vitamin C your body absorbs from food.
Having a drug or
alcohol dependency
that affects your diet.
Having a poor diet during your pregnancy or while
breastfeeding
.
Having a restrictive diet or
food allergies
.
Other health conditions such as
type 1 diabetes
and
inflammatory bowel disease
.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of scurvy range from fatigue to bleeding gums.

What causes scurvy?

fevers

Diagnosis and Tests
How is scurvy diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider can diagnose scurvy based on your symptoms. They’ll perform a physical examination and evaluate you based on certain risk factors for the condition.
What tests will be done to diagnose scurvy?
Your healthcare provider may request a blood test to measure the amount of vitamin C in your blood. In addition, they may perform a test called a dermoscopy. With this procedure, they’ll take a sample of your affected skin or hair (
biopsy
) and examine it under a microscope.
Management and Treatment
How is scurvy treated?
Scurvy treatment is essential to avoid further complications. The condition is easily treatable by consuming more vitamin C. You should try to maintain a nutritious diet that includes one to two times your daily recommended amount of vitamin C. You can do so by adding fresh fruits and vegetables to every meal.
Your healthcare provider may also recommend taking a
vitamin C supplement
until you feel better. Children with scurvy can take a supplement of up to 300 milligrams (mg) daily. Adults can take between 500 mg and 1000 mg.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Scurvy is a disease caused by an extreme vitamin C deficiency. While a diet low in vitamin C can cause a deficiency, the condition usually doesn’t reach the level of scurvy. To avoid any risk, make sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables with your diet. Citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits are great choices, but you can also get plenty of this nutrient through potatoes, tomatoes and even strawberries. If you’re experiencing any symptoms of scurvy, see your healthcare provider right away.
