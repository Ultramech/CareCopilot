Peritonsillar Abscess
A peritonsillar abscess is a pus-filled pocket that forms near one of your tonsils. It’s usually a complication of tonsillitis and is often caused by the same bacteria that cause strep throat. Symptoms include severe pain, swollen tonsils and swollen lymph nodes. Treatments include needle aspiration and tonsillectomy.

Peritonsillar abscess vs. tonsillitis: What’s the difference?
Tonsillitis
is an infection of your tonsils, while a peritonsillar abscess is an area of pus-filled tissue next to your tonsils. A peritonsillar abscess is often a complication of tonsillitis, but this isn’t always the case.
Who usually gets peritonsillar abscesses?
Peritonsillar abscesses can affect anyone, but they’re most common in children, adolescents and young adults.
How common are peritonsillar abscesses?
Peritonsillar abscesses occur in about 1 in every 10,000 people. So, while it’s rare overall, it’s still one of the most common head and neck infections.
Is a peritonsillar abscess serious?
A peritonsillar abscess can be serious, especially if it grows so large that it blocks your throat. This can make it difficult to speak, swallow or breathe. Left untreated, the infection can even spread to your
mouth
, neck, chest or
lungs
.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a peritonsillar abscess?

sore throat
is the first sign of a peritonsillar abscess, with additional symptoms developing over the next few days. Other common peritonsillar abscess symptoms include:
Tonsillitis.
Fever
.
Chills
.
Swelling of your face and neck.
Headache
.
Earache.
Drooling.
Difficulty swallowing

Muffled voice or

There are certain factors that can increase your risk for peritonsillar abscesses, including
smoking
and
gum disease
.
Is a peritonsillar abscess contagious?

Diagnosis and Tests
How are peritonsillar abscesses diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will perform an examination of your throat, neck and mouth. They may also take a throat culture or blood test. In some cases, they may order imaging tests, such as
ultrasound
or a
CT scan
.
Management and Treatment
How are peritonsillar abscesses treated?
In most cases, a peritonsillar abscess requires surgical drainage and antibiotics. If you get more than one peritonsillar abscesses, you may need a tonsillectomy.
Antibiotics
Your healthcare provider will prescribe
antibiotics
, which may be given intravenously (through a vein) or taken in pill form. Common oral (by mouth) antibiotics include
penicillin
,
amoxicillin
, cephalosporin and
clindamycin
.
Peritonsillar abscess drainage
In most cases, your healthcare provider will drain the peritonsillar abscess. To do this, they’ll make an incision in the abscess to release the fluid inside of it.
Tonsillectomy
If you have recurrent (repeated) peritonsillar abscesses, your healthcare provider may recommend a
tonsillectomy
. During this procedure, your tonsils are surgically removed.
Does a peritonsillar abscess need surgery?
In most cases, yes. If it’s the first time you’ve had a peritonsillar abscess, your healthcare provider will likely drain the abscess and prescribe antibiotics. However, if you’ve had recurring (repeated) peritonsillar abscesses, they may recommend a tonsillectomy.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a peritonsillar abscess?
If you have a peritonsillar abscess, you may be treated as an outpatient. However, if you have severe swelling that blocks your airway or other complications, you may have the abscess drained in the hospital. If so, you’ll probably need to stay there for a few days. Your healthcare provider will use a combination of treatments to ensure you’re feeling better as soon as possible.
Prevention
Can I prevent peritonsillar abscesses?
You can’t prevent peritonsillar abscesses altogether. However, you can reduce your risk by:
Not smoking.
Practicing good
oral hygiene
.
Treating oral infections promptly.
