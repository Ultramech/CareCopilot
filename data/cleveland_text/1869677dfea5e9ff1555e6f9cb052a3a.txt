Overview
What is aspergillosis?
Aspergillosis is a term for an infection caused by several types of
Aspergillus
fungi
(plural of fungus).
Aspergillus
is usually found outdoors, in dead leaves, plants, soil or compost. It’s occasionally found in moist environments indoors. Most people breathe in
Aspergillus
spores every day without getting sick. But in certain people,
Aspergillus
can cause allergic reactions, chronic lung conditions and invasive disease that spreads to your brain, kidneys, lungs or other organs.

Is
Aspergillus
black mold?
Aspergillus
isn’t black mold. “Black mold” is a common term used for the fungus
Stachybotrys chartarum
. This isn’t the same mold that causes aspergillosis, but both are common molds that can make some people sick.
What does aspergillosis feel like?
Aspergillosis can cause symptoms similar to many other illnesses, like fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you’re at risk for aspergillosis, talk to a healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms.
Who does aspergillosis affect?
Different types of aspergillosis are more likely to affect certain people:
Allergic aspergillosis usually affects people with
asthma
,
bronchiectasis
or
cystic fibrosis
.
Chronic forms of aspergillosis usually affect people with chronic lung conditions, like
COPD
,
sarcoidosis
and
tuberculosis
.
Invasive aspergillosis usually affects people with a weakened immune system. This includes people who’ve had an organ or
stem cell transplant
, those who use
corticosteroids
regularly, those who have
diabetes
and those with too few of certain white blood cells (
neutropenia
).
What are the types of aspergillosis?
Types of aspergillosis include:
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (APPA).
Aspergilloma (“fungus ball”).
Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.
Invasive aspergillosis. Fever is a common symptom.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of aspergillosis?
Symptoms of aspergillosis vary depending on the type and location in your body. Symptoms of infections or allergic reactions in your lungs are the most common. They include:
Advertisement
Coughing (sometimes
coughing up blood
).
Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
Noisy breathing (wheezing).
Chest pain.
Fever.
Fatigue and weight loss can be symptoms of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.
You may have additional symptoms if the infection spreads to other parts of your body, including:
Body part

Symptoms
Eyes.
Fungal keratitis.
Red eyes; eye pain; blurred vision.
Sinuses.
Allergic or invasive Aspergillus sinusitis.
Stuffy or runny nose; headache; reduced sense of smell.
Skin.

What causes aspergillosis?
Many different species of the fungi
Aspergillus
cause aspergillosis.
A. fumigatus
is the most common cause.
Aspergillus
lives in the environment around us, so we can easily breathe it in. Most people’s bodies eliminate
Aspergillus
fungus without getting sick. But certain conditions, like a weakened immune system or chronic lung disease, can make it easier to get sick from
Aspergillus.
How do you get an
Aspergillus
infection?
Inhaling
Aspergillus
from the air can cause an allergic reaction or an infection in your sinuses or lungs. From there, it can move to other parts of your body if your immune system can’t fight off the infection. It can also get into your body through a cut in your skin.
Is aspergillosis contagious?
No, aspergillosis isn’t contagious. You can’t catch it from another person.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is aspergillosis diagnosed?
How a provider diagnoses aspergillosis depends on your symptoms and health history. Imaging like
X-rays
or
CT scans
, tests of fluid or tissue, and allergy tests all help to diagnose various forms of aspergillosis. Its symptoms look similar to many other illnesses, so your provider may need to do additional tests to rule out other conditions.
What tests will be done to diagnose aspergillosis?
Tests a provider may order to diagnose aspergillosis include:
Allergy tests
.
Your provider may order blood or skin tests to diagnose allergic or chronic forms of aspergillosis.
Biopsy.
Your provider may take samples of tissue or fluid to test for signs of an
Aspergillus
infection.
Blood tests.
A blood test can help diagnose invasive aspergillosis early in people who have severely weakened immune systems.
Culture.
Your provider may take samples of your body fluids — such as blood, mucus (sputum), or fluid from around your lungs, brain or spinal cord — and try to grow
Aspergillus
from it.
Imaging
. Your provider may use X-rays or CT scans to look for signs of
Aspergillus
in the area of your body they think might be infected.
Management and Treatment
How is aspergillosis treated?
How your provider treats aspergillosis depends on the type and any underlying conditions you have. Surgery,
antifungal medications
and
corticosteroids
are the most common treatment options.
Surgery for aspergillosis
Surgery can often cure aspergillosis caused by a single fungus ball. Providers also use it to treat invasive and allergic aspergillosis in certain circumstances. Providers usually don’t recommend surgery to treat chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.
Antifungal treatments for aspergillosis
Antifungal medications treat many kinds of aspergillosis. If one type of antifungal isn’t working, your provider may prescribe a different one. Possible antifungal treatments include:
Advertisement
Voriconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole or itraconazole.
Liposomal amphotericin B.
Caspofungin or micafungin.
Corticosteroids for aspergillosis
Corticosteroids (like prednisone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone) reduce inflammation. A provider might prescribe them to treat allergic forms of aspergillosis or skin infections. Which one you’re prescribed depends on where in your body you have an infection. Different types of corticosteroids include:
Oral (pills you swallow).
Inhaled (breathed in through your mouth with an
inhaler
).
Nasal (a mist you spray into your nose).
Topical (applied to your skin).
Can aspergillosis be cured?
Surgery or antifungals can cure some types of noninvasive aspergillosis. In some cases, it may go away and come back again (recur). Invasive aspergillosis can be very hard to cure.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have aspergillosis?
Everyone’s body responds to aspergillosis differently. What you can expect depends on your health, underlying conditions and what type of aspergillosis you have. Talk to your provider about what to expect in your specific situation. Most people will need follow-up screenings, even if they are successfully treated.
What’s the outlook for aspergillosis?
The outlook for aspergillosis depends on the form:
Aspergillomas that haven’t invaded tissue usually aren’t dangerous and can be successfully treated with surgery.
Allergic forms of aspergillosis aren’t usually life-threatening but can cause lung damage if they go untreated for a long time.
Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis can complicate underlying conditions like COPD. It can be life-threatening. Treatment often helps symptoms, but the infection can come back again and again.
Invasive aspergillosis can be life-threatening. Since people with invasive aspergillosis almost always have an immune system that can’t fight off the infection, it can be hard to treat. If you have invasive aspergillosis, you’ll need to be treated as soon as possible and monitored closely.

Aspergillosis complications
Your risk of experiencing complications depends on which type of aspergillosis you have. All types can cause lung damage, including:
Scarring (
fibrosis
).
Widening of your airways (
bronchiectasis
).
Collapsed areas of lung (
atelectasis
).
Invasive and chronic aspergillosis can cause additional complications, including:
Moving to and damaging other organs.
Tissue destruction.
Respiratory failure.
Sepsis.
Prevention
How can I prevent aspergillosis?
It’s hard to avoid
Aspergillus
molds. If you’re at high risk for infection, talk to your provider about the best ways to protect yourself. Your provider might:
Prescribe an antifungal medicine to prevent infection.
Test you for signs of infection to make sure you get treated early.
You might be able to reduce your exposure to fungi by:
Avoiding areas with lots of dust or mold, such as construction sites or compost piles.
Avoiding activities such as gardening or lawn mowing. If you might be exposed to airborne dust or mold, wear an N95 face mask.
