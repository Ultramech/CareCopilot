Turner Syndrome
Turner syndrome happens when your female baby is born with a missing or partial X chromosome. It causes symptoms like short stature, delayed puberty and issues with ovary function. There’s currently no cure. Treatment involves managing hormone levels and other health conditions.

What Is Turner Syndrome?
Turner syndrome (TS) is when one of the X
chromosomes
is partially or completely missing. It’s a
congenital condition
(meaning, a condition that you’re born with) that affects
females
only.

TS affects everyone differently. But short height and low-functioning
ovaries
are the two most common features of the condition.
The disease may affect
1 in 2,000 to 2,500
infant girls.
Symptoms and Causes
Turner syndrom affects everyone differently. Some common features include short height and sexual development changes.
Symptoms of Turner syndrome
Some girls have noticeable Turner syndrome symptoms early in life, while others might not show signs until later. Symptoms can be mild and develop gradually during childhood. Or they can be significant and noticeable shortly after birth. Still, others don’t receive a diagnosis until adulthood.
Your healthcare provider may suspect TS before birth based on
prenatal genetic testing
or
pregnancy ultrasound
. Signs include the fetus having:
Heart problems
Kidney/urinary problems
Fluid collecting around the back of the neck
Symptoms of TS that appear at birth or shortly after are:
Ear
differences, like low-set ears, elongated ears, cup-shaped ears and thick ear lobes
Low hairline at the back of the neck
A short, wide neck or webbed neck
Small and receding lower jaw
Broad chest and nipples that are spaced far apart
Arms that point out slightly at the elbows
A missing knuckle that makes a finger or toe shorter than the rest
Flat feet
Narrow fingernails and toenails
Some of the signs and symptoms of TS in children, teens and adults are:
Advertisement
Growing more slowly than peers (usually noticeable by age 5)
Lacking
growth spurts
as a child or teen
Having delayed or absent
puberty
(not developing
breasts
or getting a
period
)
Having low levels of sex hormones (like
estrogen
)
Having smaller than average ovaries that only function for a few years or not at all (
primary ovarian insufficiency
)
Not being able to get pregnant (
infertility
)
Almost everyone with Turner syndrome experiences short height and ovaries that don’t work as they should. As TS affects everyone differently, you should talk to your child’s healthcare provider about what symptoms and features to expect or look out for.
Turner syndrome causes
Turner syndrome happens when one X chromosome is partially or completely missing in your female child.
Humans typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. These include 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes (called autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes. You inherit one chromosome of each pair from each biological parent. The 23rd pair determines sex at birth: Typically, females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).
Researchers don’t yet understand why this happens. It could be because of a problem with the egg or sperm at conception or due to a change in the X chromosome during fetal development.
Types of Turner syndrome
There are two main types. The type depends on whether the X chromosome is completely or partially missing.
Monosomy X.
This type means your female baby is completely missing one X chromosome. It happens due to an error with either the
sperm
or the
egg
from the biological parent. If that sperm or egg leads to
conception
, the fetus will only have one X chromosome. This is typically the more severe and recognizable form of TS.
Mosaic Turner syndrome.
This type means the X chromosome is partially missing. It happens randomly during
fetal development
. This is typically the milder form of TS, which may go undiagnosed.
Complications of Turner syndrome
People with Turner syndrome are at higher risk for certain health conditions. These can include:
Cardiovascular disease
.
Up to 50% of people with TS are born with a congenital heart condition that affects the structure of their hearts. The condition usually involves the
aorta
, which is the large blood vessel that delivers oxygen-rich blood to your body.
Skeletal issues
.
Bone conditions are common with TS and may include increased risk for
osteoporosis
,
bone fractures
and
scoliosis
.
Autoimmune conditions
.
TS increases your risk of
celiac disease
,
Hashimoto’s disease
and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
.
Hearing issues.
Hearing loss
can develop in people with TS. This can be due to frequent middle
ear infections
or loss of nerve function.
Vision
and eye problems.
The most common vision issues include
refractive errors
(nearsightedness and farsightedness), crossed eyes and
lazy eye
.

People with Turner syndrome may also have:
Kidney
conditions.
TS increases your risk for kidney problems, which can lead to
frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)
.
Metabolic syndrome
.
People with TS are at an increased risk for metabolic syndromes, like cardiovascular diseases,
Type 2 diabetes
and
stroke
.
Learning disabilities
.
People with Turner syndrome usually have typical intelligence, but they may have some learning challenges. These often involve issues with
memory
and understanding how things fit together in space. For example, driving might be harder for them.
Mental health challenges
.
Living with the disease may lead to issues with self-esteem, which can cause
depression
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Healthcare providers can diagnose Turner syndrome before or after birth.
Before birth, they use the following tests to diagnose the condition:
Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT)
.
These are
blood tests
during pregnancy that detect congenital disorders in the fetus.
Ultrasound during pregnancy
.
This may show that the fetus has some features of TS, like heart problems or fluid around the neck.
Amniocentesis
and
chorionic villus sampling
.
Providers perform a
genetic test
with karyotype analysis on
amniotic fluid
or
placental tissue
. It can confirm if the fetus has Turner syndrome.

After birth, a
karyotyping test
can confirm Turner syndrome. This is a blood test. A
pathologist
will check your blood for a missing X chromosome.
Management and Treatment
How is Turner syndrome treated?
There’s no cure for Turner syndrome. But certain medications and therapies can help manage symptoms.
Besides caring for related medical problems, treatment often focuses on
hormones
. Treatments may include:
Human growth hormone
therapy.
Human growth hormone shots help kids with TS grow taller. If they start early enough, these shots add several inches to how tall they end up being.
Estrogen therapy
.
Most girls with TS need estrogen therapy to go through puberty. It helps with things like growing breasts and getting a period. Estrogen also helps make bones stronger and supports heart health. This treatment usually continues until the age of
menopause
.
Progestin
therapy.
Providers may prescribe progestin in a specific cycle later, years after estrogen therapy begins. This helps people with TS have period bleeding more like a natural menstrual cycle.
When should my child see their healthcare provider?
Early diagnosis and treatment are key. Pay attention to your child’s growth and milestones. Perhaps you noticed your child doesn’t seem to be growing as you expect, or you see unusual physical symptoms. Talk to their pediatrician about your concerns.

Certain treatments, like hormone therapy, are most effective if you start them early. Your child will likely need frequent check-ups to prevent common health complications with TS.
Providers also recommend that children with Turner syndrome:
Get screened for learning disabilities.
This should happen as early as 1 or 2 years old. Working with your child’s teachers can help address issues before learning disabilities get more serious.
Work with a mental health professional.
A
child psychologist
can help with social issues and low self-esteem, anxiety and depression.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) can help your child navigate and cope with these challenges.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has Turner syndrome?
Turner syndrome affects everyone differently. It’s impossible to predict how it’ll affect your child. The best way you can prepare is to talk to healthcare providers who specialize in Turner syndrome. They can help you navigate the lifelong treatment your child will need.
What is the life expectancy with Turner syndrome?
The life expectancy for people with Turner syndrome might be slightly shorter. But with close monitoring of the health issues that may come with TS, people can usually expect to live a typical
lifespan
.
