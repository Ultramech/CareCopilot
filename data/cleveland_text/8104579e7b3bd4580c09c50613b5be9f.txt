How often should I have my eyes examined?
Having your eyes and vision checked regularly can help your optometrist identify problems right away. How often you should get your eyes checked usually depends on your age:
Kids:
A
pediatrician
should check your child’s eyes before they start school. Your child’s provider may do an eye exam sooner than this if they think your child may have a vision or eye issue. They’ll do follow-up exams every year.
Adults 18-65:
Every year or two.
Adults older than 65:
Every two to four years.
Adults older than 55:
Every year.
You might need your eyes checked more often than this if you wear glasses, contacts or need treatment for an eye or vision issue. Ask your optometrist or healthcare provider if you need eye exams more often.
How do I take care of my eyes?
Tell your optometrist or another eye care specialist about any changes in your vision. Talk to your eye care specialist if you notice any new symptoms in your eyes, including:
Blurry vision
.
Red eye
.
Eye pain
.
Double vision.
Light sensitivity (photophobia)
.
New
eye flashes
or floaters in your vision.
Your vision is changing enough that you notice it — especially if it’s suddenly worse.
Which questions should I ask my optometrist?
You may want to ask your optometrist:
How often should I have my eyes checked?
Which type of corrective lenses will I need?
Which tests will I need?
Will I need any medication for my eyes or vision?
