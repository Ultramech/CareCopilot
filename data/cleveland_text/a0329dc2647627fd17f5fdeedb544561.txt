Virilization
Virilization is when a female develops male characteristics or when a newborn has signs of male hormone exposure at birth. It can happen if your adrenal gland makes too much androgen or if you take anabolic steroids. Treatments to reverse virilization include surgery and steroids.

Overview
What is virilization?
Virilization (pronounced “vee-ruh-lai-ZAY-shun”) is a process in which a
female
develops male characteristics or when a newborn has signs of male hormone exposure at birth. It can happen if your
adrenal glands
make too much male hormone (
androgen
) or if you take anabolic steroids.

Virilization in females vs. males
A person who is female can develop virilization at any age. In adult females:
Their breasts become smaller.
Their
uterus
shrinks.
Their clitoris enlarges.
Their periods become irregular.
Virilization is less obvious in males. If signs aren’t apparent at birth, they may become apparent during
puberty
. Many males who produce excess androgen also
start puberty earlier
than their peers. In adult males, excess adrenal hormones might suppress testicular function and lead to
infertility
.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of virilization?
Symptoms vary from person to person and may include:
Increased facial or body hair.
Acne
or oily skin.
Irregular periods
.
Male pattern baldness
.
Smaller breast size.
Enlarged clitoris
.
Deepening of the voice.
Increased sex drive.
What causes virilization?
The main cause of virilization is overproduction of male hormones (androgens).
Health conditions that may result in excess androgens include:
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
.
Cushing syndrome
.
Adrenal gland tumors (like
adrenal adenoma
).
Ovarian tumors
.
Virilization can also occur if you take
anabolic steroids
to enhance physical performance (more common in sports like weightlifting).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is virilization diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will do a
physical examination
and review your symptoms and medical history. To confirm a diagnosis, they may request a:

Blood test
to measure your androgen levels.
Imaging tests
,
like an
ultrasound
,
CT (computed tomography) scan
or
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
to get a better look at your adrenal glands or
ovaries
.
Management and Treatment
How is virilization treated?
It depends on the cause. Treatments to reverse virilization include:
Glucocorticoids
. This is a type of
steroid
that can suppress male hormone production in your adrenal glands. Healthcare providers use this treatment when a genetic condition (like congenital adrenal hyperplasia) is the culprit.
Adrenal gland removal (adrenalectomy)
. When an adrenal tumor causes virilization, treatment usually involves surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland. Most adrenal tumors are benign (noncancerous). Rarely, they can be malignant (cancerous).
Oophorectomy
(removal of ovaries)
. Surgery is the standard treatment for ovarian tumors that cause virilizing symptoms. Depending on your age and whether you plan to become pregnant in the future, your provider may recommend a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. During this procedure, they remove one ovary and one fallopian tube to preserve the possibility of pregnancy.
Outlook / Prognosis
Is virilization reversible?
Virilization is typically reversible with appropriate treatment. Your healthcare provider will come up with a personalized plan that fits your needs.
There is, however, one possible exception regarding anabolic steroids. Females who develop virilizing symptoms because of them may experience permanent vocal changes. But some can raise the pitch of their voice again through treatment at a specialized voice center.
Prevention
Can virilization be prevented?
You can’t prevent virilization if you have a genetic condition that causes your symptoms. But you can successfully manage your condition with treatment.
Females who take anabolic steroids have an increased risk of virilization. If you take these medications, follow your healthcare provider’s instructions to reduce your risk of unwanted symptoms.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
You know your body better than anyone. Call a provider any time you notice something out of the ordinary. If you suddenly develop thicker body hair or other symptoms that aren’t typical for you, let a provider know. They can find out why and let you know whether they recommend treatment.
Additional Common Questions
Hirsutism vs. virilization: What’s the difference?
Hirsutism
is when a female develops increased body hair — most commonly on their face, chest, belly, back and inner thighs. People who have hirsutism experience less severe symptoms compared to those who have virilization.
Like virilization, hirsutism can happen when your adrenal gland makes too much androgen. But it’s also a symptom of several other conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and Cushing syndrome.

What is an undervirilized male?
The term “undervirilized male” refers to a person who's male but produces lower-than-typical levels of male hormone (androgen). This results in female characteristics.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Feeling comfortable in your body is part of cultivating a happy, healthy life. Developing visible characteristics that don’t match the way you feel on the inside can take a toll on your mental health. What’s more, your symptoms may point to an underlying health condition. If you have signs of virilization, talk to a healthcare provider and take your first step toward diagnosis and treatment.
