Orthotist & Prosthetist
You might go to an orthotist if you need a custom brace, splint or shoe insert to support or restrain certain parts of your body. You might go to a prosthetist if you need to be fitted for a prosthetic limb. There’s a lot of cross-over between these two healthcare providers and the kinds of training and skills they need to do what they do.

What conditions does a prosthetist treat?
Prosthetists can help treat limb loss or natural limb differences. You might see a prosthetist if you were born with an issue that affects how one or more of your body parts develop. It’s common to work with a prosthetist after an
amputation
.
What Is the Difference Between an Orthotist and a Prosthetist?
There’s a lot of overlap between orthotists and prosthetists. Some providers are both at the same time. Others choose to specialize as one or the other.
The main difference is the kinds of issues they help manage. Orthotists create tools that help you sit, stand or move more comfortably and safely. Prosthetists create devices to replace missing or unusually formed body parts.
Do orthotists and prosthetists go to medical school?
No, they don’t go to medical school. They’re both a type of healthcare provider called allied health professionals. They offer a special service that works alongside other types of care.
Orthotists and prosthetists have their own education and residency requirements. They earn a master’s degree in orthotics and/or prosthetics. They study lots of kinds of sciences. Some, like anatomy and pathology, are common for healthcare providers. But they also study some engineering and design. These help them build the customized devices that fit your body.
Are orthotists and prosthetists clinicians?
Yes, they are. “Clinician” is just another word for healthcare provider. Whatever you call them, your orthotist or prosthetist will make sure you get the help you need. They’ll take measurements or make impressions of your body to design custom devices. They’ll make sure your devices are made right and fit your body correctly. They’ll also show you how to use them.
You might work with an orthotist temporarily. But you may visit them throughout your life to help you manage certain conditions. You’ll probably visit a prosthetist every so often for the rest of your life if you use a prosthesis.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Orthotists and prosthetists are healthcare providers who can both help you move and use your body better. They make devices that can help manage everything from short-term injuries to lifelong disabilities. If you need orthotics or a prosthesis, they’ll make sure you get a good design with the right fit.
