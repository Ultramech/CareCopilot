Ectopia Lentis
Ectopia lentis happens when the lens in your eye is dislocated or moved out of its normal place. Usually, your lens sits right behind your pupil in the center of your eye. You have ectopia lentis if something forces your lens out of alignment into other parts of your eye.

Overview
If you have ectopia lentis, the lens in your eye is out of its usual place.
What is ectopia lentis?
“Ectopia lentis” is the medical term for the lens in your
eye
being moved out of its usual alignment in the center of your eye.

The lens is one part of your eye that focuses light that enters your eye. This focused light passes through your eye and into your brain to become the images you see. You have one lens in each eye located behind your pupil (the black center of your eye).
Ectopia lentis usually happens after a trauma or injury damages your eye. Children are sometimes born with ectopia lentis (congenital ectopia lentis) caused by a
genetic mutation
.
Ectopia lentis that only affects one of your eyes is called isolated ectopia lentis. Ectopia lentis that affects both your eyes at the same time is bilateral ectopia lentis.
Visit an
eye care specialist
as soon as you notice any changes in your eyes or vision. They’ll diagnose the cause of the ectopia lentis and tell you which treatments you’ll need to repair your lens.
How does ectopia lentis affect my body?
The lens in your eye is a lot like the lens of a camera — it adjusts to help you see clearly and focus on what’s in front of you. If you have ectopia lentis, the lens in your eye is out of its usual place. This will make your vision blurry or out of focus. It might cause you to have a
refractive error
.
The farther off-center your lens is, the more your vision will be affected. If you were born with ectopia lentis, your lens may drift further out of alignment as you get older. If a trauma caused ectopia lentis, you might not be able to see at all out of your affected eye.

People with ectopia lentis are more likely to develop other health conditions that affect their eyes, including:
Glaucoma
.
Cataracts
.
Retinal detachment
.
Who is affected by ectopia lentis?
Ectopia lentis can affect anyone. Experts have found that it affects
men
more often than women.
Anyone can experience an
eye injury
. Kids and teenagers are more likely to injure their eyes, especially while playing sports or doing other recreational activities. People who play contact sports like football and hockey have a higher risk, too. And baseball and softball players are more likely to have an eye injury from a flying ball.
How common is ectopia lentis?
Ectopia lentis is rare. Experts estimate that it affects fewer than 10 out of every 100,000 people worldwide.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of ectopia lentis?
The most common symptoms of ectopia lentis include:
Myopia (nearsightedness)
.
Astigmatism
.
Red eye
.
Eye pain
.
Diplopia (double vision)
.
What causes ectopia lentis?
The most common causes of ectopia lentis include:
Eye injuries
.
Genetic disorders
.
Health conditions that affect your eyes.
Eye injuries
Traumas and other injuries that damage your eye can force your lens out of alignment, including:
Sports injuries
.
Car accidents.
Falls.
Genetic disorders
Genetic disorders happen when a mutation affects your genes, or when you have the wrong amount of genetic material. You receive half of your genes from each biological parent and may inherit a mutated gene from one or both of them.
Some genetic disorders can increase your risk of developing ectopia lentis, including:
Marfan syndrome
.
Weill–Marchesani syndrome.
Aniridia.
Homocystinuria.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
.
Pierre Robin syndrome
.
Retinitis pigmentosa
.
Refsum disease
.
Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
.
Persistent pupillary membrane
.
Health conditions that affect your eyes
Any health condition that damages your eyes or the tissue in them can cause ectopia lentis, including:
Pseudoexfoliation syndrome.
Hyperinsulinemia
.
Syphilis
.
Eye cancer
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is ectopia lentis diagnosed?
An eye care specialist will diagnose ectopia lentis with an
eye exam
. They’ll look at your eyes (including inside them). They’ll also give you a
visual acuity test
to check your vision.
Your eye care specialist will also check the other parts of your eye, including your:
Cornea
.
Retina
.
Eye pressure.
You might also need blood tests to check for genetic disorders that can cause ectopia lentis. A healthcare provider may run tests for genetic disorders that affect your
musculoskeletal system
, including your:
Bones.
Muscles
.
Ligaments
.
Tendons
.
Management and Treatment
How is ectopia lentis treated?
An eye care specialist or healthcare provider will treat ectopia lentis based on what caused it.
Most people need corrective lenses to restore their vision. Both
eyeglasses
and
contact lenses
can improve vision. Your eye care specialist will tell you which type of corrective lens is best for you.

Your healthcare provider will also tell you which treatments you’ll need if the ectopia lentis was caused by a trauma or genetic disorder.
Ectopia lentis surgery
You might need surgery to correct ectopia lentis if you have other issues affecting your eye (like glaucoma or a detached retina). You’ll visit an
ophthalmologist
— an eye care specialist who can perform eye surgery. They’ll let you know which type of surgery you’ll need and how long it’ll take to recover.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have ectopia lentis?
How much ectopia lentis will affect you in the future depends on a few factors:
How off-center your lens is.
How much your vision is affected.
What caused the ectopia lentis.
Your age.
Any other health conditions or injuries you have.
Your healthcare provider or eye care specialist will tell you how long it’ll take to recover and how much of your vision you should expect to get back.
Prevention
How can I prevent ectopia lentis?
Because ectopia lentis is caused by genetic mutations and traumas you can’t predict, you can’t prevent it.
Talk to a healthcare provider about your risk of passing genetic conditions on to your children. Ask them if
genetic counseling
can help you identify how genetic conditions might affect your family.
Always wear proper safety equipment for any work or activity that might cause an eye injury.

When should I have my eyes examined?
Having your eyes and vision checked regularly can help an eye care specialist identify problems right away. How often you should get your eyes checked usually depends on your age:
Kids:
A
pediatrician
should check your child’s eyes at every well-child visit until they’re old enough to start school, and then every one to two years.
Adults younger than 40:
Every five to 10 years.
Adults between 40 and 54:
Every two to four years.
Adults between 55 and 54:
Every one to three years.
Adults 65 and older:
Every one or two years.
You might need your eyes checked more often than this if you wear glasses or contacts or need another type of visual aid. People who have diabetes, certain eye diseases or a family history of eye diseases need more frequent eye exams. Ask your eye care specialist how often you need your eyes examined.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your vision — especially if it’s suddenly worse. Even if you don’t have ectopia lentis, it’s important to have your eyes examined right away when you notice new blurriness or feel like your eyes can’t focus correctly.
Go to the emergency room if you’ve experienced a trauma or suddenly lose vision in one or both eyes.

What questions should I ask my doctor?
What caused the ectopia lentis?
Which tests will I need?
Will I need corrective lenses — if so, are glasses or contacts better for me?
Will I need surgery?
Do I need genetic counseling to know about any genetic mutations I might pass on to my children?
Additional Common Questions
What is the difference between ectopia lentis and lens subluxation?
Ectopia lentis and lens subluxation are different names for the same condition. Your eye care specialist might refer to your affected lens as having a degree of subluxation. That’s the medical term for how far out of alignment it is.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
No matter what causes ectopia lentis, if the lens in your eye is out of its usual alignment your vision will be blurry and out of focus. Fortunately, most people can see clearly again with glasses or contacts. If ectopia lentis was caused by a trauma or genetic condition, you might need other treatments in addition to corrective lenses. Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice anything different about your vision, even if things just feel a little “off” or not as sharp as they usually are.
