What Is Auditory Processing Disorder?
Auditory processing disorder (APD) is a condition that makes it harder to process sounds and language. You hear words, but it might take your brain a bit longer to understand them. You may also have trouble focusing in environments with lots of background noise. With APD, you have trouble understanding speech even though you don’t have
hearing loss
. You may also be more of a visual learner.

APD is usually discovered in childhood. But it can be found in adults, too. Although there’s no
cure
for APD,
audiologists
have treatments that can help manage your symptoms.
Another name for APD is central processing disorder.
Types of auditory processing disorders
People with APD often experience it in unique ways. There are several different types of auditory processing disorders. A few of them include:
Decoding
. You hear sounds but your brain can’t process them as words.
Integration
. It’s hard to multitask when you’re listening. Taking notes in school is one example.
Organizational
. You have trouble recalling information in a specific order.
Prosodic
. You have difficulty interpreting tone and inflection. For instance, you might not notice that the tone of a person’s voice scoops up at the end of a question.
You may only have one type of APD. Or you might have a combination of two or more.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have auditory processing disorder?
APD affects each person differently. Self-care starts with understanding how APD impacts you.
For children and adults, APD treatment can help manage symptoms. Additionally, children with APD may notice an improvement in their symptoms as they grow older.
Additional Common Questions
Is auditory processing disorder a form of autism?
No, APD isn’t a form of autism spectrum disorder. But sometimes, the two conditions occur together. For instance, a child with autism might have communication challenges that could worsen APD symptoms.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you have APD, communicating with others can feel exhausting or embarrassing. Your brain works overtime to understand the words you hear — and that can use up a lot of mental energy. If this sounds familiar, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you find ways to adjust and give you the tools you need for success.
