Stenosis or Stricture
Stenosis and stricture are medical terms that mean a passageway inside your body is narrower than it should be. Your heart valves, intestines, esophagus and trachea are all examples of passageways that can become too narrow. Medications, procedures and surgeries are common treatments.

Overview
What do stenosis and stricture mean?
Stenosis and stricture are medical terms that refer to the abnormal narrowing of any channel or passageway in your body. You’ll see stenosis or stricture in the names of medical conditions affecting
blood vessels
, digestive organs and more.

Many people use stenosis and stricture interchangeably because they both mean narrowing. In general, stenosis and stricture both refer to processes that shouldn’t be happening and that may harm you.
You’ll typically need treatment (like medication or surgery), especially if the stenosis or stricture is causing symptoms. Learning more about these medical terms can help you get a sense of what’s going on inside your body and take an active role in your care.
Stenosis definition
Stenosis is the narrowing of a passageway in your body that prevents a certain substance or structure (like blood or nerves) from passing through as easily as it should. You’ll most commonly see the word stenosis used to refer to the narrowing of:
Arteries
, like your
carotid arteries
or
renal arteries
.
Heart valves
, like your aortic valve or mitral valve.
Parts of your respiratory system, like your windpipe (
trachea
) or voice box (
larynx
).
Sometimes, stenosis is very mild and causes no symptoms. But even mild stenosis can worsen over time and lead to symptoms or complications down the road.
Severe stenosis can cause life-threatening complications. For example, narrowing in your
carotid arteries
that limits blood flow to your brain can cause a
stroke
.

Stricture definition
Like stenosis, the word stricture also refers to the narrowing of a passageway in your body. Most often, healthcare providers use stricture to refer to narrowing in parts of your:
Digestive system, like your
esophagus
, intestines or
bile ducts
.
Urinary system, like your
urethra
or
bladder
neck.
Reproductive system, like your
vagina
or
cervix
.
Types of stenoses and strictures
You can develop narrowing in many different parts of your body. So, there are many types of stenoses and strictures. Here are some examples, broken down according to the parts of your body they affect.
Heart valves and arteries (circulatory system)
Your heart valves are the “doors” that open and close to allow blood to move through each section (
chamber
) of your heart. Your arteries are blood vessels that send oxygen-rich
blood
to all the organs and tissues in your body. Your heart and blood vessels make up your
circulatory system
. Stenosis in heart valves or arteries can lead to serious medical issues.
Here are some examples of specific conditions:
Aortic valve stenosis (aortic stenosis)
.
This is narrowing or blockage of the door that lets blood leave your heart to nourish the rest of your body. Your
aortic valve
connects the bottom left chamber of your heart (left ventricle) with your
aorta
. Narrowing of your aortic valve interferes with normal blood flow out of your heart and may lead to heart damage.
Carotid artery stenosis
. This is narrowing or blockage of your carotid arteries, which send oxygen-rich blood to your brain. Most people don’t have symptoms until lack of blood flow leads to a transient ischemic attack (
TIA
) or stroke.
Coronary artery disease
. Although stenosis isn’t in the name, that’s the process that’s occurring. Plaque gradually narrows your
coronary arteries
. Severe narrowing limits blood flow to your heart and may lead to a
heart attack
.
Mitral valve stenosis (mitral stenosis)
. This is narrowing or blockage of the door that lets blood travel from your top left heart chamber (left atrium) to your bottom left heart chamber (left ventricle).
Pulmonary artery stenosis
. This is a condition that affects babies and children. It involves narrowing in one or more of the
arteries
that carry blood from your child’s heart to their
lungs
.
Renal artery stenosis
. This is narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your
kidneys
. There usually aren’t any symptoms until the condition progresses and leads to reduced kidney function.
Subclavian artery stenosis
. This is narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to your arm. You have a
subclavian artery
on each side of your body. Stenosis usually affects your left subclavian artery, so symptoms (like muscle cramps or tingling) will occur in your left arm.
Spine
Your
spine
supports your body and helps you move. It’s made up of 33 small bones (vertebrae) stacked on top of one another. Your vertebrae align to form a narrow passageway, called your spinal canal. This passageway contains your
spinal cord
.
Just like a boat traveling along a canal, your spinal cord runs down the length of your spinal canal. And like the canal needs to be wide enough for the boat to pass through, your spinal canal must be wide enough to allow room for your spinal cord.
If your spinal canal grows too narrow in any one spot, it can irritate the
nerves
in your spinal cord and lead to symptoms like pain or tingling. Healthcare providers call this condition
spinal stenosis
. It can affect any portion of your spine, but it most often affects the parts that run through your lower back (
lumbar spine
) or your neck (
cervical spine
).
One specific type of spinal stenosis, called
foraminal stenosis
, causes narrowing of the openings where nerves exit your spinal cord.
Airways (respiratory system)
Your airways are the routes for air to travel into and out of your body. They’re a vital part of your
respiratory system
, and you rely on them to stay open so you can breathe.
Tracheal stenosis
is narrowing of your trachea, which sends air from your throat to your lungs. It happens when scar tissue forms along your trachea and makes it harder for air to pass through. Tracheal stenosis is typically a complication of
intubation
. It can also affect people with medical conditions that cause inflammation and scarring in their tracheas.
Advertisement
Subglottic stenosis
is less common than tracheal stenosis. It’s when the lower part of your voice box (subglottis) becomes abnormally narrow. While it’s known to happen from intubation or infection, the cause is often unknown.
Digestive system
Your
digestive system
breaks down and absorbs nutrients from your food. It also prepares solid waste (poop) and gets rid of it.
Narrowing can affect various parts of your digestive system. For instance:
Esophageal stricture
is the narrowing of your esophagus. Chronic
acid reflux
is the most common cause.
Intestinal stricture
refers to the narrowing of part of your
small intestine
or
colon
. You might also see the terms small bowel stricture or colonic stricture. Such narrowing may occur due to inflammation, scar tissue or both. People with
Crohn’s disease
have an increased risk of intestinal strictures due to chronic inflammation in their digestive organs. Intestinal strictures can lead to
bowel obstruction
.
Anal stenosis
refers to the narrowing of your
anal canal
, typically due to scar tissue. It may occur as a complication of anorectal surgery, such as
anoplasty
.
Biliary stricture
is the narrowing or blockage of the bile ducts that carry bile (a fluid that helps with digestion) from your liver to your small intestine.
Pancreatic cancer
and
bile duct cancer
are the main causes.

Urinary and reproductive systems
Sometimes, parts of your
urinary system
or reproductive system (
male
or
female
) can grow too narrow. This might happen as a complication of certain treatments or surgeries. Or it could happen due to injuries or infections.
The specific types of stenosis or stricture you might have can vary according to your
sex
. Examples include:
Bladder neck contracture
. This is when there’s a narrowing of the outlet at the bottom of your bladder that lets urine (pee) pass to your
urethra
. This condition affects males as a possible complication of
prostate
surgery.
Urethral stricture
. This is the narrowing of the tube (urethra) that lets pee exit your body.
Posterior urethral stenosis
refers to narrowing of the uppermost part of your urethra. These conditions mostly affect males.
Vaginal stenosis
. This is the narrowing of the vaginal canal that’s a possible side effect of
radiation therapy
to your pelvis. This condition affects females.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of stenoses and strictures?

What causes stenoses and strictures?
Common causes of stenoses and strictures include:
Advertisement
Plaque
buildup (in your arteries).
Complications of medical procedures, surgeries or treatments.
Infection.
Injury or trauma.
Other medical conditions, especially those that cause chronic
inflammation
.
Wear and tear to your body as you get older.
In some cases, the cause is unknown.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are stenoses and strictures diagnosed?
Healthcare providers typically diagnose stenoses and strictures through one or more of the following:
Physical exam
and review of your symptoms.
Blood
and/or
urine
tests.
Imaging tests like
ultrasound
,
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) or
CT scan
(computed tomography scan).
Tests that use a scope to get a close-up view from inside your body (
endoscopy
).
If you don’t have symptoms, you might not realize there’s an issue. In this case, your provider might diagnose a stenosis or stricture through testing done for other reasons (incidental finding).
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for stenoses and strictures?
Treatment can vary widely depending on your specific diagnosis. Your healthcare provider will discuss available options and tailor treatment to your needs. In general, possible treatments include:
Oral medications.
Steroid injections
.
Physical therapy.
Procedures or surgeries.
Procedures and surgeries typically involve doing one or more of the following:
Using a balloon or another device to open up the space that’s too narrow (for example,
angioplasty
treats stenosis in arteries).
Placing a small device called a
stent
to help keep the space open.
Removing plaque buildup (
endarterectomy
).
Removing scar tissue.
Replacing or reconstructing damaged parts of an organ.
Surgeons can often use
minimally invasive
methods to give you the treatment you need. Your care team will tell you more about what’s possible in your situation. They’ll also explain your recovery timeline and how to take care of yourself.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a stenosis or stricture?
It’s important to keep in mind:
Treatment may take a while
. You may need multiple visits to your provider to take care of the issue. For example, dilation to treat esophageal strictures is an outpatient procedure (meaning you go home the same day) that typically happens once a week for several weeks. Your provider will use a device to widen the narrowed space in your esophagus a little at a time.
Stenosis or stricture can happen again after treatment
. For example, a previously opened coronary artery can narrow again (
restenosis
). If this happens, you may need another procedure or surgery.
Follow-ups are crucial
. Your provider will keep a close eye on your condition and make sure you’re healing well after a procedure or surgery. They’ll also look for signs that a stenosis or stricture is happening again (recurring).
You might need to make changes in your daily life
. Your provider may recommend some changes to what you eat or your activity level. You might need to move around more or less, depending on your situation. For example, if you’re recovering from surgery, you might need to rest a while. After successful treatment for stenosis in an artery, you may need to move around more in your daily life to lower the risk of future
cardiovascular disease
.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Follow the appointment schedule your provider gives you and ask if anything is unclear. Call your provider right away if:
You have new or worsening symptoms.
Treatment doesn’t seem to be helping as expected.
You have signs of complications after surgery, like fever, or changes at your incision site (discoloration, draining or swelling).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your healthcare provider calls it stenosis, but you might know it as struggling to breathe after carrying a basket of laundry up the stairs. Or as the pain that shoots down your leg after you’ve been standing for a while. Narrowing of different structures inside your body can happen slowly and silently, until one day, you realize your symptoms are more than just a minor annoyance.
It’s important to seek medical care when you notice unusual symptoms or feel something just isn’t right. Your provider will talk to you about how you’re feeling and run tests if necessary. They’ll help you get the treatment you need to have the best chance of a full recovery.
