A note from Cleveland Clinic
It can be a challenge to get the right amount of sleep to perform at your best when you’re awake. If you have trouble falling asleep, staying awake or feeling rested, talk to a healthcare provider. Your primary care physician may refer you to a sleep specialist. A somnologist can help you determine what’s interfering with your ability to sleep so you can feel better.
