What Does My Stool (Poop) Color Mean?
The color of you poop can mean a lot of things. Most of the time, your poop color has something to do with something you ate. But sometimes, it can be a sign of an underlying health condition. Contact a healthcare provider if your poop is any other shade than brown, especially if you have other symptoms.

What does the color of your poop mean?
While brown poop is ideal, you’ve probably had poop that’s green, yellow or even red. Most of the time, the color of your poop points to something you ate. But this isn’t always the case. Sometimes, colorful poop points to an underlying health condition.

It can be OK to see a poop color that’s not brown occasionally or when food is to blame. Once the food is out of your system, your poop should return to brown. But you may not be sure what’s causing your poop to change colors.
Green poop
may be the spinach you had at lunch or the icing on the cupcake you had for dessert. But green poop could also point to something like an
infection
or your stools passing too fast.
Red poop may stem from drinks containing red food dye or eating beets. Or it may be a sign of
hemorrhoids
or
rectal bleeding
.
Blackish poop
could be due to taking
iron supplements
,
Pepto-Bismol®
or eating lots of blueberries. It could also suggest upper
digestive system bleeding
.
Yellowish poop could point to
bile duct
issues or
celiac disease
. It could mean you’re eating too many fatty foods or foods high in beta-carotene like carrots, yams or squash.
Clay, white or gray poop could mean you have a
liver
, bile duct,
gallbladder
or
pancreatic
. But some over-the-counter
drugs
or drinking too much dairy could also cause it.
The best thing you can do is check in with your healthcare provider. Tell them your symptoms, especially if you have a
fever
,
diarrhea
or pain. Poop that’s red or black is often most alarming as it could suggest bleeding (not always).

If your poop doesn’t go back to brown or changes colors often, it could mean something else is going on.

What is a normal poop color?
Brown is the ideal poop color for adults. This doesn’t mean you’re not healthy if you have a few random, off-color poops. The shade of brown can also vary. If your poop stays a color that’s not brown, it could be a sign that something is going on.
Healthy
poop colors for babies
are a little different, though. In this case, normal color can vary depending on what foods they eat and if they drink
breastmilk
or formula.
When in doubt about poop colors and what’s normal, it’s best to talk to a healthcare provider.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your poop is normally brown, so why is it bright green today? Seeing a bright array of colors in the toilet can make you panic. The good news is that most of the time, a colorful toilet bowl points to something you ate. Once that food is out of your system, your poop should go back to its normal hue. But when the color lingers for a few days or weeks, it may be a sign of something more serious. Things like infection and diseases can make your poop unusual colors. Contact a healthcare provider if your poop doesn’t go back to brown within a few days.
