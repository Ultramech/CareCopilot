Overview
Overbite refers to vertical distance, while overjet refers to horizontal distance.
What is an overjet?
Overjet describes a type of
malocclusion
(bad bite). It happens when your upper front
teeth
protrude, or stick out, further than they should. Another name for overjet is “buck teeth.”

Most people’s upper front teeth protrude past their lower front teeth by about 2 millimeters. That’s what
dentists
consider normal. But if your teeth stick out more than 2 millimeters, that’s an overjet.
Appearance is a common concern among people with overjet. Many worry that it negatively affects their smile. But overjet can impact your oral health and function, too. When your teeth don’t fit together properly, it can cause chewing difficulties,
jaw pain
,
headaches
and other issues.
You can fix overjet with braces in most cases. But you might need additional
orthodontics
or
jaw surgery
if you have severe overjet (8 to 10 millimeters or more).
Overbite vs overjet: What’s the difference?
Many people say “overbite” when they really mean “overjet.” Both terms refer to types of malocclusion, but they’re not the same thing.
Overbite refers to vertical distance, while overjet refers to horizontal distance:
Overbite
is a “deep bite.” It happens when your upper front teeth overlap your lower front teeth more than they ought to. Most people have a small overbite. An overlap of 2 to 4 millimeters is typical. But if your upper front teeth cover (or obstruct) more than 30% (about 4 to 6 millimeters) of your lower front teeth, that’s an overbite.
Overjet (buck teeth)
refers to protruding teeth — when your upper teeth stick out further than 2 millimeters past your lower front teeth.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of overjet?
Overjet symptoms vary depending on whether your teeth protrude a little or a lot. With overjet, you might have:
Trouble with biting or chewing.
Difficulty closing your lips completely.
Ulcers
or sore spots on your
tongue
or inner cheeks from accidentally biting them.
Jaw, face or
tooth pain
.
Speech challenges (less common).
What causes buck teeth (overjet)?
Varying factors can cause overjet teeth, including:
Genetics
. If a biological parent or sibling has an overjet, you have a higher chance of developing one, too.
Tongue thrusting
. This is when your tongue presses against the back of your upper front teeth when you swallow. It’s a common occurrence in babies, but adults can develop the habit, too.
Finger or thumb sucking
. Many children suck their thumbs or fingers to soothe themselves. It’s a perfectly natural behavior. But after age 4, thumb or finger sucking can contribute to overjet.
Pacifier use
. Prolonged pacifier use can cause overjet just like thumb sucking can. If you’re concerned about your child’s pacifier use, talk to their
pediatrician
for suggestions.
What happens if you don’t fix overjet?
Buck teeth (and all types of malocclusion) can cause complications that worsen with age. Left untreated, overjet can result in:
Facial pain.
Jaw pain.
TMJ disorder
.
Chronic headaches.
Tooth erosion
.
In some cases, overjet can make it harder to
brush and floss
properly. This can increase your risk for
cavities
and
gum disease
.
Sometimes, overjet can contribute to issues with appearance and function. But plenty of people do well without an “ideal” overjet, so it’s not always necessary to treat it.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is overjet diagnosed?
A
dentist
can tell you if you have overjet during a dental examination. They’ll measure the horizontal distance between your lower front teeth and your upper front teeth. If your upper teeth protrude further than 2 millimeters, you might have overjet.
Your dentist may also need to take X-rays.
Dental X-rays
can give them important information about the health of your teeth and
gums
.
Management and Treatment
How do you fix an overjet?
Treatments for overjet include:
Braces
.
Clear braces
.
Headgear
.
Herbst appliance
.
Palate expanders
.
Oral surgery
.
Dentists and orthodontists consider many factors when recommending treatment, like your age, how much of an overjet you have and whether your overjet interferes with oral health or chewing function.
How to fix overjet without braces
You can’t fix overjet without orthodontics or surgery. But if appearance is your main concern, these
cosmetic dentistry
treatments may camouflage the issue:
Dental bonding
.
Veneers
.
Dental crowns
.

It’s important to know that these procedures don’t correct the underlying condition. So, if overjet interferes with health or function, you might need braces or surgery to fix it.

Outlook / Prognosis
Do buck teeth go away?
Orthodontic treatment is the only way to fix buck teeth (overjet). They won’t go away naturally over time.
Prevention
Can overjet be prevented?
Many people are born with an overjet. In these instances, there’s nothing you can do to prevent it.
These recommendations may help you reduce your child’s risk for overjet:
Limit thumb sucking and pacifier use, especially after age 4.
Avoid traditional sippy cups. Sucking on the spout can eventually cause your child’s front teeth to stick out.
Tell your dentist if you notice tongue-thrusting habits.
Living With
When should I see my dentist?
Tell your dentist any time you develop new symptoms like a toothache, facial pain or pain when chewing. You should also see your dentist for routine
cleanings
and exams.
Preventive dental visits
can reduce your risk for overjet-related complications.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If the appearance of your teeth makes you feel embarrassed or self-conscious, treatment can help. In addition to enhancing your smile, treatment can ease symptoms, improving your overall oral health and quality of life. If you have overjet, ask your dentist about ways to correct it. Treatment may be easier than you think.
