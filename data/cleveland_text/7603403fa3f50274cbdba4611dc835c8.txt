ROHHAD Syndrome
ROHHAD syndrome is an extremely rare and life-threatening disorder with symptoms that start to unfold between the ages of 0 and 9. Hallmark signs include rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, breathing issues and damage to the autonomic nervous system.

Overview
What is ROHHAD syndrome?
ROHHAD syndrome is an extremely rare, life-threatening disorder that affects a child’s
endocrine system
,
autonomic nervous system
and breathing. Children with ROHHAD syndrome gain a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. Additional symptoms include changes in breathing when asleep and sometimes when awake. It can also be associated with changes in behavior and emotional regulation.

ROHHAD syndrome is a fairly new condition, first described in 1965. To date, there are less than 200 documented cases of ROHHAD syndrome worldwide. Experts continue to research the condition in hopes of discovering a cure. There’s no specific test or treatment for ROHHAD syndrome. Rather, healthcare providers manage the condition by addressing each individual symptom.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of ROHHAD syndrome?
Prior to the onset of symptoms, children with ROHHAD syndrome usually have good health with typical growth and development. Your child may develop ROHHAD syndrome up to age 9, but most children start showing signs between ages 2 and 4.
The acronym ROHHAD refers to the hallmark symptoms of the condition:
(RO) Rapid-onset obesity
: This refers to dramatic and rapid weight gain with an associated increase in appetite (20 to 30 pounds over three to 12 months, for instance).
(H) Hypothalamic dysregulation
: The
hypothalamus
is a part of your brain that controls your
pituitary gland
and regulates several body functions like growth, weight, appetite, puberty, emotions and behavior. If your child has hypothalamic dysregulation, they may have symptoms like
obesity
, short stature,
seizures
,
developmental delay
, too much or too little urination, and early or late
puberty
. They can also develop
hypothyroidism
and
diabetes
.
(H)
Hypoventilation
: Children with ROHHAD can’t properly regulate their breathing. Their body doesn’t take deeper breaths or faster breaths when oxygen levels are low, and their carbon dioxide levels are high. In children with ROHHAD, this can often initially present as respiratory failure from a mild respiratory illness such as a cold or following anesthesia.
(AD) Autonomic dysregulation
: Your autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls basic functions like breathing, digestion, heart rate and body temperature. Children with damage to their ANS can develop symptoms like
bradycardia
(an abnormally slow heart rate), decreased body temperature and reduced sensitivity to pain.

What causes ROHHAD syndrome?
Experts don’t know what causes ROHHAD syndrome. But there are three main ongoing theories, including:
Genetics
. Many researchers believe a
genetic mutation
causes ROHHAD syndrome. But so far, they haven’t identified a specific one.
Epigenetics
. Some researchers believe that, in some cases, the genes that manage certain body functions can turn on and off. A
research study
on identical twins — one who developed ROHHAD syndrome and one who didn’t — supports this theory.
Autoimmunity
. Some research studies link
autoimmune diseases
to ROHHAD syndrome. One study found immunoglobulins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
two children
with ROHHAD. Researchers used this information to identify inflammation in the
central nervous system (CNS)
.
What are the complications of ROHHAD syndrome?
In addition to the hallmark symptoms listed at the beginning of this section, children with ROHHAD syndrome may develop complications like:
Mood and behavioral conditions
. These conditions cause symptoms like irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, fatigue, anxiety, depression and
intellectual disability
.
Neurologic conditions
. Children with ROHHAD syndrome may have seizures,
nystagmus
(abnormal shaking of the eyes),
sleep apnea
or developmental disorders.
Metabolic disorders
. Common metabolic disorders among children with ROHHAD syndrome include diabetes,
insulin resistance
, impaired glucose intolerance and
steatotic (fatty) liver disease
.
Neural tumors
. About 40% to 56% of children with ROHHAD syndrome develop nerve tumors like ganglioneuroma. Most of these
tumors
are benign (noncancerous), but they can be malignant (cancerous).
Cardiorespiratory arrest
. This potentially fatal complication refers to the sudden loss of breathing and heart function.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is ROHHAD syndrome diagnosed?
Currently, there’s no single test that can provide a definitive ROHHAD diagnosis. Rather, healthcare specialists work together to find a diagnosis based on the unique combination of symptoms.
To receive a ROHHAD diagnosis, a child must have:
Rapid-onset obesity and hypoventilation during sleep.
Hypothalamic dysfunction symptoms like rapid weight gain, hypothyroidism or altered (early or late) puberty.
Absence of
PHOX2B
gene variant to distinguish between ROHHAD and
CCHS (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome)
— another condition that shares some of the same symptoms, like shallow breathing during sleep.
Symptoms are absent during the first few years of life.
Due to the rarity of ROHHAD, many children are initially misdiagnosed.
Management and Treatment
How is ROHHAD syndrome treated?
ROHHAD syndrome treatment depends on your child’s symptoms, and every treatment plan is unique. There’s one exception, though. Once children with ROHHAD demonstrate abnormal breathing in sleep, they’ll need to use a CPAP or
BiPAP
, and eventually use a
ventilator
to support their breathing.
Children with ROHHAD syndrome may receive care from a range of pediatric experts, including:
Pulmonologists
.
Neurologists
.
Endocrinologists
.
Otolaryngologists
.
Cardiologists
.
Sleep specialists
.
Nutritionists
.
Oncologists
.
Psychologists
.
Psychiatrists
.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for children with ROHHAD syndrome?
There’s currently no cure for ROHHAD syndrome. The main goal of treatment is to manage the unique symptoms of each child.
ROHHAD syndrome life expectancy
Due to the rarity of ROHHAD syndrome, life expectancy is hard to estimate.
Cardiorespiratory arrest is the most common cause of death.
Prevention
Can ROHHAD syndrome be prevented?
There’s no known way to prevent ROHHAD syndrome — at least not yet.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
ROHHAD syndrome is a rare and relatively new condition — and research is still in its infancy. When it comes to the health of your child, every day without answers feels like an eternity. Reach out to your healthcare provider for support. They can recommend treatments to manage your child’s symptoms and resources to help you stay informed.
