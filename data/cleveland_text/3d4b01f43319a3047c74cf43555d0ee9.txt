Overview
Eczema on the lips causes dry, scaly and cracked lips.
What is eczema on the lips?
Eczema on the lips, also known as eczematous cheilitis, is inflammation or irritation on the skin of your lips. It’s sometimes associated with
atopic dermatitis
. It can lead to dry, scaly or painfully cracked lips. It’s a more severe form of chapped lips. Chapped lips are usually temporary, but eczema on the lips tends to be long term (chronic).

Diagnosis and Tests
How is eczematous on the lips diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider evaluates your lips and checks for other areas of skin irritation or inflammation. They also review your health history, including any allergic reactions you’ve had in the past. Be sure to let them know if anyone in your family has a history of atopic dermatitis or other allergic skin conditions.
Your healthcare provider may perform tests to confirm a diagnosis of eczema on the lips:
Allergy testing
, such as a skin patch test or skin prick test, to find out if a specific substance is causing your lip irritation.
Blood or urine tests
to check for viral or bacterial infections.
Management and Treatment
How is lip eczema treated?
If you have lip dermatitis, try to stop habits such as licking, biting or sucking your lips. You should also avoid irritants such as lip balms or lipsticks. Your healthcare provider may recommend:
Petroleum jelly or unscented, hypoallergenic moisturizer to soothe dry, cracked lips.
Steroid ointment to reduce inflammation.
In rare cases, people with severe lip eczema need oral steroids (taken by mouth) or a special prescription skin cream or ointment that prevents your immune system from overreacting to allergens.
