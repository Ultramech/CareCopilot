Treatment Details
How does existential therapy work?
Existential therapy is similar to other types of talk therapy. The practice is based on theory and dialogue. The therapy environment is a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings without judgment.
When you first meet with your therapist, they’ll ask you questions about your goals of therapy. Your therapist will structure dialogue to help you reach your goals while exploring parts of what makes you human and how your choices impact who you are.
Existential therapy is grounded in the present. Your therapist may ask you about your past experiences to help you understand more about the decisions that led you there.
The focus of each session is to help you find acceptance of the four pillars of existential therapy. It’s normal to experience strong emotions and recall difficult memories during your treatment.
How long is an existential therapy session?
A therapy session is a time when you meet with your therapist. This usually happens once per week for about one hour at a time.

How long will I need existential therapy?
Existential therapy isn’t a long-term form of therapy. You may continue the therapy until you reach your goals. This time frame varies based on each person, but it could take several months.
Is there anything I can do to make existential therapy easier for me?
When you start therapy, it can be difficult to open up with your new therapist. It could take several sessions before you feel comfortable sharing your personal history or feelings with them. When you approach each session, keep an open mind and understand that your therapist is there to help you reach your goals. If at any time you feel uncomfortable or like you’re not progressing, bring up your concerns with your therapist or other members of your care team. They can help you find solutions so you can get on track to meet your goals.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
It can be overwhelming to start therapy. You may feel nervous or anxious opening yourself up to a new person, which can make you feel vulnerable. This is a normal part of the process. Existential therapy is a way for you to learn more about yourself and your place in the world. It can help you find closure, comfort and hope while addressing difficult topics that are part of being human. You may face challenges when you begin existential therapy, but your therapist will help you overcome any roadblocks that get in the way of reaching your goals.
