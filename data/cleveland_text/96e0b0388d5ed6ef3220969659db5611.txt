If you have questions about microsurgery, the consultation is a great time to ask.
What happens during a microsurgery procedure?
During a microsurgery procedure, you’ll be under general
anesthesia
and asleep. You won’t feel any pain. A microsurgery procedure takes place at a hospital.
Each type of microsurgery procedure is different, depending on what your surgeon needs to do.
For example, during a tissue transfer, your surgeon will remove tissue from a healthy donor site on your body. Then, they’ll reattach the tissue to the relocation area by making another incision and reattaching blood vessels with an operating microscope. When the tissue transfer is complete, your surgeon will close your incisions with removable stitches or dissolving sutures.
What is a flap in microsurgery?
Microsurgery relocates, repairs or rebuilds tissue using existing tissue from your body. It’s taken from a donor site. A flap is a piece of tissue with its own blood supply from your body. Your surgeon will use it to replace missing tissue in another area of your body.
What happens after microsurgery?
Your course of treatment after a microsurgery procedure varies based on the type of microsurgery you had. If you had a flap reconstruction, for example, your surgical team will monitor your flap closely to ensure that the reconnected blood vessels are working well. It’s critical to monitor blood vessel function during the first 24 hours after surgery.
It can take several months before your body heals completely and you’ll see the results of your surgery. You should schedule regular visits with your surgeon after the procedure to verify that your body is healing. You won’t be able to operate a vehicle or go to work or school immediately after your surgery.
