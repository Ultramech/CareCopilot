Adjuvant Therapy
Adjuvant therapy targets cancer cells that primary cancer treatment (usually surgery) didn’t destroy. Having adjuvant therapy means more time spent in cancer treatment. But it may reduce the chance you’ll have the same cancer again. Adjuvant therapy is often used as follow-up treatment for breast, colon and lung cancers.

Overview
What is adjuvant therapy?
If you’ve received
cancer treatment
, your cancer care team may recommend follow-up treatment, or adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy, sometimes called helper therapy, targets
cancer
cells that may remain after you’ve had surgery to remove a
tumor
.

Learning that you may benefit from adjuvant therapy can feel confusing. This is especially the case if your
oncologist
told you that surgery removed all signs of cancer. If treatment worked, why would you need more of it?
The problem is that cancer cells are microscopic and good at hiding. Even sophisticated imaging tests, like
MRIs
,
CT scans
and
PET scans
, can’t always detect them. The goal of adjuvant therapy is to destroy any microscopic cells you may have. This reduces the chance the cancer comes back (
recurs
).
When would I need this treatment?
When recommending adjuvant therapy, healthcare providers consider:
Cancer type
.
Adjuvant therapies often treat
breast cancer
,
colon cancer
,
lung cancer
and
skin cancer
. But they also treat other types.
Cancer stage
. Adjuvant therapy typically follows surgery to treat
early-stage
cancers so they don’t come back. Sometimes, it helps people with more advanced cancers live longer.
Cancer cell features
. Adjuvant therapy treats cancers that are likely to come back after surgery. Providers can tell how aggressive some cancers are by examining the cells beneath a microscope.
Treatment Details
What happens during adjuvant therapy?
Adjuvant therapy involves getting more treatment after your primary treatment (usually, surgery). When you hear the word “adjuvant” think
after
. It’s different from
neoadjuvant therapy
, which involves treatment you get
before
surgery.

Here are the types and what’s involved:
Radiation therapy
uses high-powered X-rays to kill cancer cells. You may need it after surgery to destroy any cells that may remain. You may need it if your surgeon was unable to remove an entire tumor.
Chemotherapy
sends drugs throughout your body to kill cancer cells that may be hiding. Chemo following
breast cancer surgery
was the first ever use of adjuvant therapy.
Hormone therapy
blocks
hormones
that fuel tumor growth. Your provider may recommend it after surgery for hormone-sensitive cancers.
Immunotherapy
helps your
immune system
destroy cancer cells. Adjuvant immunotherapies are commonly used to treat early-stage
non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC),
colon cancer
and
breast cancer
.
Targeted therapy
blocks proteins cancer cells use to grow. A newer type of treatment, the first targeted therapy drugs for adjuvant therapy, were approved in the 2000s.
What drugs are used for adjuvant therapy?
Most adjuvant therapies use drugs to destroy cancer cells. They come in pill form, as a shot or an infusion (IV). Some common ones to know about are:
Chemotherapy drugs
, like alkylating agents,
antimetabolites
and
taxanes
Hormone therapy drugs, like
tamoxifen
and
aromatase inhibitors
Immunotherapy drugs, like
monoclonal antibodies
and checkpoint inhibitors
Targeted therapy drugs, like
PARP inhibitors
and
tyrosine kinase inhibitors
But there are many more.
What are the potential benefits and risks of this treatment?
There’s never a guarantee of a
cure
when it comes to cancer. But adjuvant therapy can reduce the chance that cancer in
remission
will come back. It can also help people with incurable cancer live longer. These reasons are enough for many people to get more treatment.
But adjuvant therapy can cause unpleasant
side effects
. It can disrupt your routine by adding more doctor visits to your schedule. And there’s no way to know whether you need it. It’s possible that surgery got rid of all the cancer.
It’s your choice to accept or decline adjuvant therapy. Your cancer care team will honor your decision. They can help you weigh the pros and cons. Questions to ask may include:
What type of adjuvant therapy do you recommend?
Why am I a good candidate?
When should I start this treatment?
How long will I need treatment?
Are there any permanent or long-term side effects?
How will adjuvant therapy affect my outcome (
prognosis
)?

Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better?
Everyone’s experience is different. Adjuvant therapy may offer you the peace of mind that you’re doing everything you can to stay cancer-free. But sometimes, the benefits get overshadowed by the chance of a longer recovery.
Your cancer care team can guide you through the decision-making process. They can explain how adjuvant therapy will impact your recovery.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
When we’re dealing with tough situations — and having cancer certainly qualifies — some of us might cope by considering cancer treatment as a series of hurdles we need to leap to get to the finish line. If you’ve finished cancer treatment, adjuvant therapy may feel like an unexpected hurdle that’s slowing you down just as that finish line is in sight. If that’s your situation, take time to understand the benefits and drawbacks. Ask your healthcare provider for help with your decision. They’ll help you feel comfortable with your choice so you can cross that finish line.
