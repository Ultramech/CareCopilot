Mycoplasma Genitalium (Mgen)
Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). You can get it from vaginal or anal sex. Because Mgen often doesn’t cause symptoms, many people who have it don’t know it and unknowingly infect other people. Mgen is treatable with antibiotics.

Overview
Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can infect your cervix, urethra and/or rectum.
What is
Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen)
?
Mycoplasma genitalium
(
Mgen
) is a
sexually transmitted infection
(STI).
Mgen
is a treatable
bacterial infection
. It can infect your:

Cervix
(the opening of your
uterus
)
Urethra
(the tube that empties your pee from your
bladder
)
Rectum
(the part of your
large intestine
that comes before your
anus
)
Many people with
Mgen
don’t have symptoms. But the infection can lead to complications like
urethritis
(
inflammation
of your urethra) and
cervicitis
(inflammation of your cervix). These complications typically have symptoms.
Learning about a new-to-you STI can be overwhelming, especially when you keep hearing about it in the news. You may be wondering if you could have the infection or if it’s the cause of a reproductive health issue you have. The only way to know if you have
Mgen
is to get tested. Your healthcare provider is your partner in helping you navigate STI screening, prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
Is
Mgen
a new STD?
No,
Mgen
isn’t a new sexually transmitted infection (sexually transmitted disease). But it’s “younger” than many STIs. Researchers first identified it in 1981. But they think
Mgen
may be more common in the United States than they once thought. This is because
Mgen
was previously difficult to diagnose due to a lack of testing technology for it.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of
Mgen
?
People with
Mgen
often don’t have symptoms, but symptoms can include:

Abnormal
vaginal discharge
Burning sensation when peeing (
dysuria
)
Leaking fluid (discharge) from your penis
It’s common to feel embarrassed or ashamed if you have symptoms of an STI. But it’s important to see a healthcare provider if you have these symptoms. They’re there to help you, not judge you.
Complications of
Mgen
Without treatment,
Mgen
can lead to complications like:
Cervicitis (inflammation of your cervix)
Ectopic pregnancy
(when a fertilized egg implants outside of your uterus)
Female infertility
Pelvic inflammatory disease
(an infection that occurs in your uterus,
fallopian tubes
or
ovaries
)
Proctitis
(inflammation in your rectum)
Urethritis (inflammation of your urethra)
These complications often cause symptoms.
Mycoplasma urethritis symptoms
Mgen
is a common cause of urethritis (specifically,
nongonococcal urethritis
). People with a penis are more likely to get urethritis from
Mgen
than people without a penis.
In people with a penis, urethritis symptoms can include:
Leaking fluid (discharge) from your penis
Pain while peeing
Pain while
ejaculating
(dysorgasmia or orgasmalgia)
Itching, irritation and/or tenderness
Abdominal pain
See a healthcare provider if you have these symptoms.
How do you get
Mycoplasma genitalium
?
You can get
Mgen
by having vaginal or
anal sex
without a
condom
with someone who has the infection. Researchers are still studying if
Mgen
can spread through oral sex.
If you have
Mgen
, you can pass the infection to someone else through sexual contact even if you don’t have signs or symptoms.
What causes
Mycoplasma genitalium
?
The name of this STI is the same as the bacterium that causes it —
Mycoplasma genitalium
.
Bacteria
are microscopic living organisms that have only one cell.
Mgen
cells are smaller than most other bacteria. The infection grows slowly.
Is
Mycoplasma genitalium
contagious?
Yes,
Mycoplasma genitalium
is contagious. It’s a sexually transmitted infection. That means the infection can spread from one person to another through vaginal or anal sex without a condom.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is
Mycoplasma genitalium
diagnosed?
In the United States, a laboratory test can diagnose
Mgen
. You’ll have to see a healthcare provider or go to a clinic to get this test. The test can detect the bacterium in a pee sample or with a swab of your genital area. The swab collects a small sample of cells for testing. Your healthcare provider may swab or have you swab:
The inner part of your cervix (endocervix)
The opening of your penis where pee comes out
Your urethra
Your
vagina
If you have a positive test result, your sex partner(s) should also see a provider who can test and treat them if needed.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for
Mycoplasma genitalium
?
Prescription
antibiotics
can treat
Mgen
. Your healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic they think will work for you. Be sure to follow the instructions for taking the medication.

It’s becoming more difficult to treat some
Mgen
infections due to
antibiotic resistance
. If your symptoms continue for more than a few days after completing the course of antibiotics, see your provider.
It’s important to remember that you can get
Mgen
again after treatment if you have sex without a condom with someone with the infection.

Outlook / Prognosis
Does
Mycoplasma genitalium
ever go away?
Only antibiotics can treat
Mgen
. The infection won’t go away on its own. But it may take more than one type of antibiotic to treat
Mgen
. This is because some strains of the infection don’t respond to certain antibiotics.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If your symptoms don’t improve after treatment with an antibiotic, talk to your healthcare provider. They may need to prescribe a different type of antibiotic.
If you ever have signs or symptoms of STIs, it’s important to see a provider. Make a plan to get screened regularly for STIs based on your healthcare provider’s recommendation for how often you should get tested.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
If you have
Mgen
, it may be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:
How will I know if the antibiotic successfully treated
Mgen
?
When can I have sex again after treatment?
Am I at risk for long-term complications?
How can I prevent getting
Mgen
again?
Prevention
How can I prevent getting
Mgen
?
The only way to completely avoid STIs like
Mgen
is not to have vaginal or anal sex. But
using a condom properly
can help prevent getting the infection.

Factors that increase your risk of getting
Mgen
include:
Having anal or vaginal sex without a condom
Having multiple sex partners
Having anonymous sex partners
Having sex while under the influence of
substances
or
alcohol
, which can lower inhibitions and lead to more sexual risk-taking
Additional Common Questions
Is
Mycoplasma
the same as chlamydia?
No,
Mycoplasma genitalium
isn’t the same as
chlamydia
. Bacterium called
Chlamydia trachomatis
causes chlamydia (a STI). But you can have
Mgen
and chlamydia at the same time. Both STIs can cause complications like urethritis and infertility.
Is
Mycoplasma
the same as BV?
No,
Mycoplasma genitalium
isn’t the same as
bacterial vaginosis (BV)
. They’re two different bacterial infections. But you’re at increased risk of getting
Mgen
if you have BV. Having BV increases your risk of getting STIs in general.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It can be embarrassing to talk about anything sex-related with a healthcare provider, including STIs. But your sex life is an important part of your health that your provider needs to know about to provide care. Not getting the treatment you need for mycoplasma genitalium (
Mgen)
can pose serious risks to your health. Speak with your provider about getting regularly screened for STIs to reduce your risks of complications. Practice safer sex to prevent the spread of
Mgen
.
