Overview
What is a pulmonary contusion?
A pulmonary contusion is a bruise on your
lungs
from a chest injury. It causes fluid and
blood
to collect around your lungs. Its symptoms can sometimes be vague, like
coughing
or wheezing, until the injury is severe.

What causes a pulmonary contusion?
Blunt force trauma (impact with something dull) or a penetrating injury (one that goes through your skin and deeper tissues) causes a pulmonary contusion. The most common cause is injury from a car accident. Other causes can be explosions and stab wounds. These injuries damage the
blood vessels
around your lungs, so blood and other fluids collect in your lung tissues.
Who’s most at risk?
Anyone who’s had an injury that impacts their chest is at risk for a pulmonary contusion. Children are at higher risk for serious complications.
What are the complications of a pulmonary contusion?
Pulmonary contusions can lead to serious complications, including:
Pneumonia
.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
.
Hypoxia
, a condition where not enough oxygen is getting to your tissues.
Hypercapnia

respiratory acidosis
, conditions where you have too much carbon dioxide in your blood.

Outlook / Prognosis
How long does it take a pulmonary contusion to heal?
Pulmonary contusions take about a week to heal. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may need to stay in the hospital for longer. Some people need surgery to repair damage to their lungs or chest.
Up to 20% of people with a pulmonary contusion develop pneumonia. It’s important to practice good pulmonary hygiene, including coughing up mucous and deep breathing.
What are the long-term effects of pulmonary contusion?
People who’ve had a pulmonary contusion sometimes have reduced lung function for years after the contusion heals. This can make it hard to breathe. You might also have long-lasting scarring (
fibrosis
).
What’s the mortality rate of pulmonary contusion?
It’s hard to know the exact mortality rate from a pulmonary contusion. But studies estimate it to be between 14% and 40%.
Prevention
Can pulmonary contusions be prevented?
The only way to prevent a contusion is to avoid injury to your chest. Always wear your seatbelt when you’re driving or riding in a vehicle.
