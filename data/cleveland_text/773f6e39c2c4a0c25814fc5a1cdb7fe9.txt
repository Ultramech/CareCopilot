Joints are places in your body where two bones meet. Your knee joint connects your thigh to your lower leg. It’s where your
thigh bone
meets your
shin bone
.
The knee is the biggest joint in your body, and it absorbs and supports a lot of your weight as you move. That’s why it’s one of the most commonly injured joints. Knee joint pain can be a temporary, short-term problem, but it can also be a chronic (long-term) issue.
Knee pain can come and go. For example, you might feel pain when you’re moving or bending your knee. But it might get better when you rest. Some people also feel pain at different times of the day. You could feel more pain first thing in the morning when you wake up. It’s also common to feel pain in your knee at night, especially if you were physically active earlier that day.
You can usually treat knee pain at home with over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers and by taking a break from physical activities.
