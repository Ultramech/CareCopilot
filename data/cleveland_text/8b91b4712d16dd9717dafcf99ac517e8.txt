Your
skin
has many forms of yeast that live on it, including
Candida
. In healthy people, this ordinarily doesn’t cause any problems. But when there’s an overgrowth of
Candida
, it can dig below the surface of your skin. This can cause a rash or skin infection.
Candida
grows and thrive in moist, warm environments. It’s commonly found in damp, creased areas such the foreskin of your penis.
Who does Candida balanitis affect?
Candida balanitis can affect people of any age. About 1 in every 25 men will develop Candida balanitis in their lifetime. The condition will affect 1 in every 30 uncircumcised men.
Children under age 4 and uncircumcised people have the highest risk of being diagnosed with the condition. Candida balanitis is more likely to occur if you have a condition called
phimosis
. Phimosis means you can’t pull back (retract) your foreskin over your penis. Once children reach age 5, their foreskin usually becomes easier to retract and their risk level falls.
How common are male yeast infections?
Male yeast infections are fairly common. About 3% to 11% of men will have a yeast infection in their lifetime.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of a male yeast infection include patchy redness and irritation in your groin area.
What are the symptoms of a male yeast infection?
Symptoms of a male yeast infection include pain, swelling and redness in your groin area. The redness is usually in patches. Other symptoms may include:

Burning, itching and irritation around the head of your penis and under your foreskin.
Thick, white discharge that resembles cottage cheese.
Foul-smelling discharge.
Difficulty pulling back your foreskin.
Shiny sores or blisters on your penis.
After having a yeast infection, you may notice your skin peeling. The infection makes your skin more vulnerable. This can make it flaky or crusty and eventually it may start peeling.
What causes yeast infections in men?
A yeast called
Candida
causes male yeast infections.
Candida
grows and thrives in warm, moist environments. Candida balanitis most commonly occurs in uncircumcised men. Other conditions and risk factors that allow
Candida
to grow include:
Poor hygiene.
Using harsh soaps.
Not rinsing soap off your foreskin completely.
Not drying off thoroughly.
Irritated or damaged skin.
Sex partners with vaginal yeast infections.
Yeast infections are more common in certain groups of people. This includes people who:
Have a condition that weakens your immune system, such as
diabetes
, cancer or
HIV/AIDS
.
Have overweight or
obesity
.
Are taking
antibiotics
. Antibiotics kill bacteria that normally live in your body.
Have a
sexually transmitted infection (STI)
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are male yeast infections diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will perform a
physical examination
. They may be able to diagnose a yeast infection by looking at your penis and foreskin. If you have a red rash, they may be able to tell you have a yeast infection.
Your healthcare provider may want to collect a sample of the infected area for testing. They’ll use a scalpel or tongue depressor to gently scrape some of the skin from the infected area. A
pathologist
will examine the sample under a microscope to identify the fungus.
Management and Treatment
How are male yeast infections treated?
Treatment for male yeast infections may include an
antifungal
medication. Your healthcare provider may recommend an antifungal cream, lotion or ointment. You can apply the antifungal directly onto the infected area of your skin. You can buy many antifungal medications over the counter. Your healthcare provider may need to prescribe you a stronger antifungal medication if the infection doesn’t go away. Topical antifungal medications include:
Miconazole
(Monistat 7®).
Clotrimazole
(Lotrimin®).
Nystatin
(Mycostatin®).
In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend an antifungal medication taken by mouth. This includes medications such as
fluconazole
(Diflucan®). Your healthcare provider may also recommend using a steroid cream as well to help with your symptoms.
It’s important to keep your groin area clean and dry to help get rid of your yeast infection. This can also help prevent a yeast infection from returning.

If antifungal medications don’t help or you have frequent yeast infections, you may want to consider
circumcision
. In addition, if you can’t pull back your foreskin to clean it thoroughly, your healthcare provider may recommend circumcision as well.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a male yeast infection?
You may be able to get rid of a yeast infection fast at home with over-the-counter antifungal medication. But if the infection persists and doesn’t go away within a couple of weeks, call your healthcare provider. You may need a prescription treatment option.
How long does a male yeast infection last?
A male yeast infection may take some time to get rid of. After you start antifungal treatment, the infection should start to clear up within one to three weeks. But yeast infections aren’t easy to control. They frequently come back in uncircumcised people. If your symptoms persist, call your healthcare provider.
What complications can occur from male yeast infections?
You may be embarrassed, but it’s important to have your yeast infection checked out by your healthcare provider. An untreated yeast infection can cause many complications which may include:
Scarring and narrowing of your penis.
Pain and difficulty pulling back your foreskin or moving your foreskin over the head of your penis.
Issues with blood supply to the tip of your penis.
Increased risk of
penile cancer
.
