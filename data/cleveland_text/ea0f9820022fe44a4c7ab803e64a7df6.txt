Angular Cheilitis
Angular cheilitis is a common skin condition affecting the corners of your mouth. It leads to painful, cracked sores. People often confuse angular cheilitis with cold sores.

Other names for angular cheilitis include angular stomatitis and perleche. Sometimes people confuse angular cheilitis with
cold sores
. But cold sores are a separate condition caused by a herpes virus. Cold sores are contagious; angular cheilitis is not.
Who gets angular cheilitis?
Angular cheilitis tends to be most common in the very old and very young. Elderly people may wear dentures or have sagging skin at the corners of their mouth that contributes to dry mouth corners. Pacifiers, thumb-sucking and drooling can irritate infants’ mouths.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes angular cheilitis?
Saliva collects at the corners of the mouth and causes dryness. Very dry skin in this area can lead to angular cheilitis. Over time, the dry skin may crack open. Sometimes bacteria or fungi get into the cracks, which can cause inflammation or an infection.
Causes of dry, cracked lip corners that can trigger angular cheilitis include:
Atopic dermatitis or
eczema
.
Dentures that don’t fit.
Drooling during sleep.
Fungal or yeast infections in the mouth, such as
thrush
.
Misaligned teeth.
Skin allergies.
Sucking on a thumb or a pacifier.
Wearing a face mask.
What are the risk factors for angular cheilitis?
People of any age,
sex
or ethnicity can develop angular cheilitis. Some factors that may increase your risk, include:
Chronic health conditions, such as
diabetes
or
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
.
Down syndrome
, which can cause dry, drooping skin on the face.
Immune system disorders, such as
HIV
.
Low levels of B vitamins, iron or protein.
Rapid weight loss.
Skin
wrinkles

Management and Treatment

Your treatment plan depends on the cause of the angular cheilitis. It may include:
Antibiotics:
Oral (by mouth) or topical (on the skin) antibiotics treat bacterial infections.
Dental work:
Dentures or other mouth hardware should fit correctly. Misaligned teeth or a bite may improve with
braces
, retainers or headgear.
Dietary changes:
Eating foods rich in protein, iron and B vitamins can clear up problems caused by a poor diet or lack of nutrients.
Ointments or creams:
Antifungal creams or topical steroids relieve swelling and pain from cracked corners of the mouth. Lip balm or petroleum jelly can keep your mouth moisturized and protected.
