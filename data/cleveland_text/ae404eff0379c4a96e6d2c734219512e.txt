Overview
What are blood pressure medications?
Blood pressure medications (antihypertensives) are medicines that bring your
blood pressure
down in various ways. Some blood pressure medications make your
blood vessels
widen so blood gets through more easily. Others remove extra fluids from your blood or block natural hormones your body makes that raise blood pressure.

In addition to your age, race and
sex
, your healthcare provider will consider your other health problems and how high your blood pressure is when deciding which high blood pressure medication to give you. Your treatment will be different from your neighbor’s or your brother’s prescriptions because each of you has a unique situation.
You may need to take more than one type of high blood pressure medication to bring your blood pressure numbers down. Your healthcare provider may try one antihypertensive agent and add a second or third little by little to bring your blood pressure down. They may also start and stop antihypertensive drugs if they aren’t giving results or you develop intolerable side effects or unsafe changes in your bloodwork. Your healthcare provider will likely ask you to take your blood pressure at home each morning, before you have had any caffeine.
Most people take blood pressure medications in the form of a pill you swallow every day, but your doctor may give you some antihypertensive medications through an IV (intravenous) in your arm during a hospital stay.
What do blood pressure medications treat?
Blood pressure medications treat
high blood pressure
, or hypertension, with the goal of keeping your heart strong and preventing heart failure, a heart attack,
kidney failure
or a
stroke
. High blood pressure makes your heart’s job more difficult and more demanding. Bringing your blood pressure down makes it easier for your heart to keep pumping blood to your essential organs and cells 24 hours a day.

Risks / Benefits
What are the advantages of antihypertensives?
Blood pressure medications help many people lower their high blood pressure and keep their hearts from becoming overworked. They also help people avoid having
heart failure
, kidney failure, a
heart attack
or stroke.
What are the risks or complications of blood pressure medication?
Some older adults have a sudden drop in blood pressure when they stand up (
orthostatic hypotension
). Antihypertensive medication can make this worse, and older adults can get dizzy and fall, sometimes getting injured. Some antihypertensive medications change your electrolyte levels as you lose extra fluid in your urine. Too high or too low levels of potassium can cause dangerous heart rhythms.

Recovery and Outlook
What is my outlook on blood pressure medication?
Many people are successful in controlling their blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs. This helps prevent serious cardiovascular and kidney problems, in combination with a healthy diet and exercise. People who keep their blood pressure in a normal range keep taking their medicine at the same time every day without missing doses. They also keep going to regular checkups with periodic bloodwork to be sure the antihypertensive drugs aren’t causing any problems. It’s also important to follow a good lifestyle, including:
Keeping your sodium intake low.
Limiting your alcohol use.
Getting regular physical activity.
Controlling your weight.
Why is my blood pressure still high on medication?
There are a number of reasons why your blood pressure may still be high when you’re taking blood pressure medication. Reasons why it seems your high blood pressure medication isn’t working include:
You may need two, three or four different antihypertensives.
You’re not taking them every day.
You’re taking multiple drugs, but they work the same way.
You’re eating too much salt.
A drug you’re taking makes your body retain salt.
You’re not taking a diuretic.
You may have a condition called
secondary hypertension
, which means high blood pressure caused by a different problem with your body (
hyperaldosteronism
,
pheochromocytoma
, renal artery stenosis). If your blood pressure is very high after multiple medications are being used, this is something you should ask your doctor about.
Other drugs or herbs may prevent your blood pressure medication from working.
Recreational drugs can raise your blood pressure.

When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Tell your healthcare provider if you’re having problems with blood pressure medication side effects. They can order a different antihypertensive medication or give you a different amount (dose) of what you’re taking. Also, if your blood pressure readings get too high or too low on your
home blood pressure monitor
, tell your healthcare provider.
Additional Common Questions
Can you take fish oil with blood pressure medication?
Yes, you can. However, you should check your blood pressure regularly because taking both may lower your blood pressure more.
Will blood pressure medicine lower my heart rate?
Yes, some high blood pressure medications, such as
beta-blockers
, can lower your heart rate.
What blood pressure medications are safe in pregnancy?
You can take methyldopa, labetalol or nifedipine during
pregnancy
, but check with your healthcare provider for their recommendation. Many other antihypertensives aren’t safe for your developing fetus, so be sure to let your healthcare provider know when you plan to become pregnant.
What is the first drug of choice for hypertension?
First-line (first choice) options include these blood pressure medication names: Thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers and ― for people who have kidney disease and heart failure ― angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Beta-blockers may also be first-line choices if you have a history of heart disease.
