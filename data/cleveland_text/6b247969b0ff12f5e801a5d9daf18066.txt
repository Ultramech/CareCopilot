Ageusia (Loss of Taste)
The term “ageusia” refers to the total loss of your sense of taste. Ageusia may be caused by infections, certain medications, nutritional deficiencies or other factors. Loss of sense of taste is also a possible symptom of COVID-19. In most cases, treating the underlying cause of ageusia can restore your taste.

Overview
What is ageusia?
Ageusia (pronounced “
uh-GYOU-zee-uh
”) is the complete loss of your sense of taste. This condition makes it impossible to detect tastes like sweet, sour, salty, bitter or umami.

Your sense of taste involves lots of parts, including your
taste buds
and
nerves
that carry taste signals to your brain. Anything that damages these parts or interferes with how they work together can potentially lead to ageusia.
How common is ageusia?
True ageusia — a complete loss of taste — is rare. Out of 1,000 people, only one or two will develop the condition. It’s much less common than other related taste disorders like
hypogeusia
(a decreased sense of taste) or
dysgeusia
(a distorted, unpleasant perception of taste).
Ageusia can affect anyone, but it’s most common in people over 50. At this point, your total number of taste buds starts to decrease. Still, it’s much more common to lose some sense of taste, not all of it.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of ageusia?
Having ageusia means you can’t distinguish any taste in foods or drinks. You may have other symptoms, too, depending on what condition causes it. These may include:
High blood pressure (hypertension)
.
Nasal congestion
.
Allergies
.
Oral health problems.
What causes loss of taste?
Causes of ageusia range from health conditions and medications to lifestyle-related things, like
smoking
cigarettes. Anything that interferes with the breakdown of food into chemical signals that your
brain
recognizes as specific flavors can impact your sense of taste.

Conditions or injuries
Infections, health conditions (including nutritional deficiencies) and injuries that impact structures in your head and neck involved with taste can all lead to ageusia.
Head and neck infections that can cause ageusia include:
COVID-19
. (Most people who develop ageusia as a coronavirus symptom experience a
loss of taste and smell
.)
Sinus infection (sinusitis)
.
Common cold
.
Influenza (flu)
.
Strep throat
.
Salivary gland infections (sialadenitis)
.
Conditions affecting your mouth and
teeth
that can lead to loss of taste include:
Gum (periodontal) disease
.
Tongue inflammation (glossitis)
.
Xerostomia (dry mouth)
.
Sjögren’s syndrome
.
Burning mouth syndrome
.
Conditions or injuries affecting your nerves that may cause ageusia include:
Diabetes
.
Bell’s palsy
.
Alzheimer’s disease
.
Multiple sclerosis (MS)
.
Parkinson’s disease
.
Stroke
.
Nerve injury (including from a procedure or
radiation therapy
).
Vitamin and mineral deficiencies linked to ageusia include:
Vitamin B12 deficiency
.
Zinc
deficiency.
Medications
Hundreds of medications have loss of taste as a potential side effect, including:
Antibiotics
.
Antivirals
.
Antifungals
.
Antihistamines
.
Antiseizure medicines
.
Tricyclic antidepressants
.
Bronchodilators
.
Chemotherapy drugs
.
What are the complications of ageusia?
Ageusia can take the joy out of eating, so you eat less. The condition can also keep you from detecting harmful flavors you should avoid. This can lead to health problems like:
Unintended weight loss
.
Not getting enough nutrients (
malnutrition
).
Consuming spoiled foods or drinks.
Mood changes and
depression
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is ageusia diagnosed?
Otolaryngologists (ENTs)
diagnose taste disorders like ageusia. During your
physical exam
, they’ll review your medical history to see if any conditions, recent procedures or medications may be triggering your loss of taste. They may also recommend tests, including:
Taste tests
: During this test, a provider applies solutions that contain different dilutions of sweet, sour, salty or bitter flavors to your tongue. They may apply the solution as a drop, spray, tablet, wafer or taste strip.
Imaging tests
: You may need an imaging procedure, like
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or a
computed tomography (CT) scan
, if your provider suspects your loss of taste is related to a structural issue in your head or neck.
Lab tests
:
Blood tests
can help providers identify conditions causing ageusia, like a vitamin or mineral deficiency.
Management and Treatment
How is ageusia treated?
In most cases, treating the condition that led to ageusia helps restore your taste.

If a cold or flu causes ageusia, your sense of taste may return after taking
antihistamines
or decongestants. Healthcare providers treat Infections with
antibiotics
. Once you’ve recovered from your illness, you’ll be able to taste foods again.
Sometimes, you can reverse a complete loss of taste by changing your daily habits. For example, people who quit smoking can regain their sense of taste in as little as 48 hours. If your ageusia is related to gum disease, ramping up your
oral hygiene
rituals can help restore your taste function quickly.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have ageusia?
If you’ve been diagnosed with ageusia, your healthcare provider can help you find ways to manage your symptoms until you regain your sense of taste. Most things that cause it, like an infection, are temporary. For example, people who have ageusia as a symptom of COVID-19 usually recover in one to three weeks.
You should be able to enjoy flavors again when a healthcare provider treats the condition that caused it. Ageusia is rarely permanent.
In the meantime, be sure to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. You may find it difficult to eat, but eating nutritious foods regularly is important to your health.
Prevention
Can ageusia be prevented?
Because ageusia often results from a separate condition, it’s not always preventable. But there are things you can do to reduce your risk:
Advertisement
Keep your
mouth
moist
. Spit is an important part of taste. Help boost
saliva
production by staying hydrated. Avoid smoking or using tobacco products that lead to dry mouth.
Reduce your risk of infections
. Wash your hands frequently, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Make oral hygiene a priority
. Brush and floss daily, and visit your
dentist
regularly for checkups and
cleanings
.
Get plenty of vitamin B12 and zinc
. Good
sources of vitamin B12
and
zinc
include meat, dairy products and fortified cereals.
Switch medications (if you can)
. Changing medications isn’t always realistic. But your provider may be able to recommend a different kind if your medicine is interfering with your taste.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Sometimes, it’s obvious that another health condition or medication is causing ageusia. But if you suddenly find you can’t taste anything and aren’t sure why, call a healthcare provider immediately. They’ll run tests to determine the cause and design a treatment plan to help.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
Understanding your diagnosis can help you make informed decisions about your health. Some questions you may want to ask your provider include:
Is my loss of taste due to a cold, flu or other infection?
Could my medications be causing my loss of taste?
Do I have an underlying condition that needs treatment?
Will taking supplements help?
Is there anything else I can do to improve my sense of taste?

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Losing your sense of taste can keep you from the simple pleasure of enjoying a good meal. This alone is enough to warrant a call to your healthcare provider. But ageusia can also point to serious health concerns. It can prevent you from detecting spoiled food and drinks — or keep you from getting the nutrients you need.
See a healthcare provider if you’re having trouble tasting foods. Usually, loss of taste is a temporary inconvenience that goes away once your provider treats the condition that caused it. Get checked so you know what you’re dealing with.
