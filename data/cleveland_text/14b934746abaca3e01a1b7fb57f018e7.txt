Inflammatory Arthritis
Inflammatory arthritis happens when inflammation damages cartilage in your joints. It can make your affected joints swollen and feel warm. Autoimmune diseases, a buildup of protein crystals and infections can all cause it. Your provider will suggest treatments to manage symptoms like pain and stiffness.

Inflammation in a joint for a long time can damage

. This makes it break down. Inflammatory arthritis is different from
osteoarthritis
. That happens as your cartilage naturally wears down throughout your life.
Inflammatory arthritis can affect any joint. It’s most common in:
Knees
Hands and wrists
Hips
Elbows
Shoulders
Feet and ankles
Types of inflammatory arthritis
Some of the most common types of this disease include:
Rheumatoid arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Spondylarthritis
Gout
Pseudogout
Reactive arthritis
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of inflammatory arthritis
The most common symptoms include:
Joint pain
Swelling
Stiffness or trouble moving your joints
Skin discoloration
Heat around your affected joints
You might feel some symptoms all the time. Or you might experience symptom flares. These are when symptoms come and go. Symptoms will be more severe or noticeable during a flare.
Inflammatory arthritis causes
Inflammation in your joints causes this condition. Over time, inflammation damages your joints. How this happens depends on which type you have:
Autoimmune
:
This happens when your immune system attacks your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and spondylarthritis all belong to this type.
Crystalline
: This happens when sharp crystals of proteins clump together in your joints. This includes gout and pseudogout.
Infectious (septic)
:
Some infections can damage your joints. It’s most common from some kinds of bacterial infections. Your body fighting off an infection can lead to reactive arthritis.

Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
A healthcare provider will diagnose inflammatory arthritis with a physical exam and some tests. They’ll examine your affected joints. Tell your provider when you first noticed symptoms like pain and stiffness. Let them know if anything seems to make them worse.
Your provider might use imaging tests to take pictures of your joints. These can help your provider see damage inside your joints. You might need:
X-ray
Ultrasound
MRI
CT scan
Your provider may use blood tests to check for signs of an autoimmune disease or infection. This can also help them see issues like
high uric acid levels
. They might do a joint aspiration to check for protein crystals.
Management and Treatment
How will doctors treat inflammatory arthritis?
Your provider will suggest a combination of treatments. Some of the most common treatments include:
Over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatory medicine:
NSAIDs
or acetaminophen can manage pain and reduce inflammation.
Corticosteroids:
These are prescription anti-inflammatory medications. You might need a cortisone shot.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
: These medications can help manage autoimmune conditions.
Other prescriptions:
You might need colchicine to manage crystalline arthritis. If you have an infection, you might need an antibiotic.
Physical therapy:
This can help you strengthen muscles around your affected joints. It can also improve your range of motion.
Occupational therapy (OT):
OT can help you adjust to changes in your mobility. This can help you do your daily activities safely.
Surgery:
Your provider will usually only suggest surgery if you have severe symptoms. Or if other treatments haven’t worked. You might need a joint fusion or a
joint replacement
. Your surgeon will tell you what to expect.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Visit your healthcare provider if you experience any of the following:
Pain that lasts for more than a week
Pain that’s bad enough to make you avoid doing any of your usual activities
Stiffness that’s getting worse
Sudden difficulty moving a joint
Symptom flare ups that seem worse or happen more often
Some people with arthritis experience more severe symptoms as they age. Ask your provider how often you’ll need follow-up visits to check for changes in your joints.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
Some types of inflammatory arthritis are chronic (long-term). Others get better with treatment.
Autoimmune arthritis might never go away. That’s because many autoimmune diseases aren’t curable. But you should feel better after starting treatments.
Crystalline arthritis may enter remission. This is a long period between symptom flares. You might go months between flares once you find the right treatments.
Infectious arthritis usually gets better once you treat the infection that caused it. But the damage might be permanent. Your provider will tell you what to expect.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Inflammatory arthritis can make it feel like your affected joints are having a bonfire inside your body. The pain, stiffness and heat can make it tough to move and use your joints. The good news is that inflammatory arthritis usually responds very well to treatment.
