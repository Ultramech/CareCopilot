Hormone Therapy for Breast Cancer
Hormone therapy treats hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, including the most common type of breast cancer — estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Oncologists use hormone therapy to keep breast cancer from spreading or coming back after treatment. They often combine hormone therapy with surgery or targeted therapy.

Overview
What is hormone therapy for breast cancer?
Hormone therapy (also called endocrine therapy) is a common treatment for hormone receptor-positive (HR+)
breast cancer
. In HR+ breast cancer, you have cancerous
tumors
that rely on the hormones
estrogen
and
progesterone
to grow. Your body produces these hormones. HR+ breast cancer accounts for 2 of every 3 breast cancer cases in the U.S.

Policy
A tumor may be
estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)
, progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) or both ER+ and PR+. ER+ is the most common type of breast cancer: About 8 out of 10 breast cancers are estrogen receptor- positive.
Hormone therapy for breast cancer works by:
Blocking cancerous cells’ access to estrogen and progesterone.
Lowering estrogen levels. Cancerous cells stop growing when they don’t get enough estrogen.
Hormone therapy for breast cancer isn’t the same as
hormone therapy for menopause
. Hormone therapy for menopause boosts hormone levels to relieve menopause symptoms.
Why do people receive hormone therapy for breast cancer?
Oncologists
may use hormone therapy:
To reduce the chance of breast cancer in people with high risk, such as mutations (changes) in their
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
genes
.
To reduce breast cancer risk in people with
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
.
Before
breast cancer surgery
to shrink cancerous tumors (neoadjuvant therapy).
After breast cancer surgery to reduce the risk breast cancer will
come back
(recur) or develop in the other breast (
adjuvant therapy
).
To treat
metastatic breast cancer
.
What are types of hormone therapy for breast cancer?
Hormone therapy for breast cancer may include aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or estrogen receptor down regulators (SERDs):

Aromatase inhibitors
:
If you have ER-positive breast cancer and you’ve gone through menopause, your healthcare providers may use this type of hormone therapy.
Exemestane
(Aromasin
®
),
letrozole
(Femara
®
) and anastrozole (Arimidex
®
) are commonly used aromatase inhibitors.
Ovarian function suppression:
Your provider may prescribe medications like
leuprolide
(Lupron
®
) and
goserelin
(Zoladex
®
, Zoladex 3-Month
®
) if you develop ER+ breast cancer before you go through menopause. Ovarian suppression therapy slows down cancer growth by keeping your ovaries from making estrogen.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM)
:
Healthcare providers use SERM medications to treat estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. SERMs like
tamoxifen
(Nolvadex
®
, Soltamox
®
) and
raloxifene
(Evista
®
) are effective treatments for some types of breast cancer.
Selective estrogen receptor down regulators (SERDs):
This treatment works by blocking estrogen and making it more difficult for estrogen to connect with cancerous cells. Examples are f
ulvestrant
(Faslodex
®
) and elacestrant (Orserdu
®
).

What if I don’t want hormone therapy?
If you have breast cancer, you should know you have many treatment options. Your oncologist recommends treatment plans based on what they know about the kind of breast cancer you have, your overall health, your lifestyle and your preferences. Take your time to study your options, talk to your oncologist and weigh the risks and benefits of hormone therapy.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
If you have hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, your treatment likely will include hormone therapy. Oncologists may combine hormone therapy with surgery and/or targeted therapy to slow down or stop breast cancer cells from growing. Ask your oncologist about specific hormone medications and how they may be helpful. Your oncologist will be glad to discuss treatment with you.
