Pediatric Dentist
A pediatric dentist is a dentist for kids. They specialize in taking care of teeth from babyhood to teenage years. Pediatric dentists do preventive care like checkups and cleanings. They can also treat cavities and infections. You should take your child to their first dental visit whenever their first tooth erupts or by their first birthday.

What is a pediatric dentist?
A pediatric dentist (pedodontist) diagnoses and treats oral health conditions in kids. They can also teach your child why
oral hygiene
is important and help them create good habits for life.

Pediatric dentists are like
general dentists
. But they know more about conditions that can affect your child’s
teeth
, jaws and
gums
as they grow. They offer a wide range of procedures to treat common oral health concerns like
cavities
.
Most pediatric dentists work in offices with fun, warm and laid-back atmospheres. They often decorate with bright colors or fun themes to help children feel more comfortable. Their waiting rooms are typically filled with age-appropriate toys, books, puzzles and games.
What kind of training does a pediatric dentist have?
In the U.S., dentists and pediatric dentists both graduate from a four-year dental school. After graduation, pediatric dentists complete two to three more years of education.
In addition to learning about teeth, a pediatric dentist also receives training in:
Child psychology
Childhood growth and development
Relaxation techniques for
anxiety in children
Treating children (and sometimes adults) with special needs
What does a pediatric dentist do?
Pediatric dentists do a wide range of preventive and
restorative
procedures like:
Crowns
. Your child might need a crown if they have a large cavity or a weakened tooth. Crowns for kids are usually made of stainless steel or a tooth-colored material.
Dental X-rays
. These can tell your pediatric dentist about the health of your child’s teeth and jawbone. X-rays can also reveal the number of permanent (adult) teeth developing under their gums and help spot potential problems early.
Dental emergency treatment
. If a
dental injury
happens, like a
knocked-out tooth
, a pediatric dentist can treat it.
Exams and checkups
. Regular dental checkups can help make sure your child’s teeth and gums are healthy.
Extractions
. If your child has a decayed or damaged tooth, your pediatric dentist might need to remove it. They may also need to remove teeth before getting
braces
, especially if your child has overcrowding.
Fillings
. Tooth decay is the most common dental problem among children. Your pediatric dentist can fill cavities using composite resin, a tooth-colored material.
Fluoride treatments
. Fluoride strengthens your child’s enamel and lowers their risk for cavities.
Sealants
. Some people have deep grooves or pits in the chewing surfaces of their back teeth. A pediatric dentist can place sealants to protect these areas from cavity-causing bacteria.
Teeth cleanings
. Regular dental cleanings are key for long-lasting oral health. During these visits, a
dental hygienist
can show your child how to brush and floss their teeth.

When should I take my child to their first pediatric dentistry visit?
Take your child to the dentist when they turn 1 or when their
first tooth appears
. This may seem early, but pediatric dentists check more than just teeth. They also look at your child’s jaws, facial bones and teeth that are still growing under their gums. This way, they can spot potential problems early and help prevent them from getting worse.
You might wonder why your child needs to see a dentist if their baby teeth are just going to fall out anyway. But baby teeth are just as important as adult teeth. Baby teeth help your child eat and speak. They also hold space for adult teeth while your child’s jaws grow. Some baby teeth will stay in your child’s mouth until they’re 12 or 13 years old.
What should I ask my child’s pediatric dentist?
If you’re about to visit your pediatric dentist, here are some questions you might want to ask:
Do you offer orthodontic consultations?
Do you offer
sedation dentistry
for kids?
How can I make brushing and flossing fun?
How do I
care for my child’s teeth
?
How do you help kids who are anxious or afraid?
How often should my child have cleanings?
Should my child wear a
mouthguard
when playing sports?
What preventive treatments do you recommend for my child?
What should I know about thumb sucking or pacifier use?
When will my child start
losing their baby teeth
?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
As a parent, there are so many things that require your attention. Between school, playtime and other activities, going to the dentist might not be a top priority. But caring for your child’s teeth now means fewer oral health problems later. A pediatric dentist can teach your child healthy habits that will stay with them for a lifetime.
