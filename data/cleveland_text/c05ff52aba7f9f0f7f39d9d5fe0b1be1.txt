Overview
What is a yeast infection under your breast?
A yeast infection under your breast is a fungal skin infection called candidiasis. A yeast called
Candida
causes candidiasis. Many types of yeast naturally live on your skin. In healthy people, this usually doesn’t cause any issues. But when there’s an overgrowth of
Candida
, the yeast can penetrate the surface of your skin, causing an infection.

What causes a yeast infection under your breasts?
A yeast called
Candida
causes yeast infections under your breasts.
Candida
grows and thrives in moist, warm environments. When moisture is trapped, it can cause the surface of your skin to stick together in your skin folds. The moisture makes it easier for your skin to rub together, which can lead to a skin condition called
intertrigo
. Intertrigo allows
Candida
to overgrow, causing a yeast infection.
Conditions and other factors that can cause intertrigo or lead to yeast infections under your breasts include:
Having large
breasts
.
Wearing improper undergarments or tight clothing.
Not changing undergarments frequently.
Not drying the area under your breasts carefully.
Breastfeeding
.
Using breast pads.
Previous vaginal yeast infection.
Hot, humid climates.
Excessive sweating (
hyperhidrosis
).

Yeast infections are more common in certain groups of people. This includes people who are:
Pregnant

Overweight or have
obesity
.
Taking
antibiotics
. Antibiotics kill bacteria that normally live in or on your body.
Yeast infections are also more common in people with weakened immune systems. This may be due to conditions such as
diabetes
. Or it may be from the use of medications that suppress your immune system.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is a yeast infection under your breasts diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will perform a
physical examination
to diagnose a yeast infection under your breasts. They may be able to diagnose a yeast infection by looking at the skin under your breasts. If you have a bright red rash, your provider may be able to tell it’s a yeast infection.
Your healthcare provider may want to collect a sample of the rash for testing. They may use a tongue depressor or scalpel to gently scrape some of the skin from the infected area. A
pathologist
will look at the sample under a microscope. This can help them determine the type of fungus that’s causing the infection.
Management and Treatment
How is a yeast infection under your breasts treated?
Treatment for a yeast infection under your breasts may include an
antifungal
medication. Your healthcare provider may recommend an antifungal cream, ointment or other solution. You can buy many antifungal creams over-the-counter. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a stronger antifungal option if necessary. You can apply antifungals directly onto the infected area of your skin. Topical antifungal medications include:
Miconazole
.
Nystatin
.
Clotrimazole
.
In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend an antifungal medication taken by mouth. This includes medications such as
fluconazole
. They may also recommend a steroid cream to help relieve your symptoms.
It’s important to keep the area under your breasts clean and dry to help get rid of a yeast infection. This can also help prevent yeast infections from returning in the future. Exposing the area under your breasts to air may help. Drying powders may also help dry out your skin and prevent future yeast infections.
