Skin Rashes in Kids
Skin rashes are common in childhood. They can cause uncomfortable symptoms like dry, itchy skin and raised patches. But you don’t have to worry about most rashes in babies and kids. Most go away on their own or only need minor treatment. They’re rarely serious. But take your child to see their pediatrician if you have any concerns about a rash.

How doctors diagnose rashes in kids
Your child’s pediatrician will ask you questions about their rash, including:
How long have they had the rash?
Has the rash changed in appearance since it first developed?
Has the rash spread to other locations on your child’s body?
Have you tried any treatments at home?
Does anyone else in your home have the rash?
Has your child started any new medications?
Then, your child’s provider will perform a physical exam. They’ll carefully look at the type of bumps or spots on your child’s body. They’ll also look at the shape, color and other important features of the rash.
Management and Treatment

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Finding a skin rash on your child’s body can be alarming. You may wonder what caused it and if it’ll go away on its own or need treatment. Your child may seem uncomfortable, too. They may have dry, itchy skin or other symptoms. But kids get tons of rashes. Most of the time, you don’t need to worry. If you have any concerns, check in with your child’s healthcare provider. They can’t always determine the cause. But they’ll get your child started on any necessary treatment.
Care at Cleveland Clinic
