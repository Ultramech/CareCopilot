Felty Syndrome
Felty syndrome is an uncommon complication of rheumatoid arthritis that affects your immunity. It’s defined by a reduction in neutrophils — white blood cells that help fight infections — and an enlarged spleen.

Overview
What is Felty syndrome?
Felty syndrome is a triad of three conditions that occur together:

Rheumatoid arthritis
.
Neutropenia
.
Splenomegaly
.
It usually starts with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the other two conditions occur as complications of RA. Healthcare providers call these “extra-articular manifestations,” meaning they’re manifestations of
arthritis
that occur outside of your
joints
. The same inflammatory and autoimmune processes cause them. Extra-articular manifestations are common with RA, but Felty syndrome is relatively rare.
How does Felty syndrome affect me?
Felty syndrome begins with rheumatoid arthritis, which is painful
inflammation in the lining of your joints
. When neutropenia and splenomegaly appear, they affect your immunity. Neutropenia is low levels of a certain type of
white blood cell
called
neutrophils
, which play an important role in protecting you against
infections
. Splenomegaly is an enlarged
spleen
, which can contribute to neutropenia.
How common is Felty syndrome?
Around 2% of people with rheumatoid arthritis develop Felty syndrome. Like RA, Felty syndrome is three times more common in
females
than in males. Those who develop Felty syndrome with RA are almost always seropositive, meaning they test positive for the
rheumatoid factor
antibody. Those who are seronegative rarely develop Felty syndrome.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Felty syndrome?
Most of the time, symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis appear before other symptoms. These include:
Joint pain
.
Joint swelling
.
Joint stiffness.
Some people develop extra-articular manifestations of RA, with additional symptoms, including:
Rheumatoid nodules
, firm lumps under your skin near your joints.
Swollen lymph nodes
in your neck or under your arms.
Swollen liver
, which might be sore or palpable to touch.
Dry
eyes
and
mouth
(
Sjogren’s syndrome
).
Swelling and redness in your eyes (
episcleritis
).
Skin ulcers (sores), especially
in your legs
.
Signs of bleeding under the skin
.
Swelling in your lungs
, causing
shortness of breath
.
Swelling around your heart
, causing
chest pain
.
Fever
.
Fatigue
and malaise.
Loss of appetite
or
unexplained weight loss
.
Felty syndrome appears with additional symptoms — occasionally, before RA symptoms — including:
Frequent, persistent infections, like
colds
,
stomach bugs
and skin infections.
Swollen spleen, which may be sore or palpable to touch.
Abnormal skin discolorations (patches).
Occasionally, Felty syndrome is diagnosed without any symptoms. Blood tests and imaging tests may show signs of rheumatoid arthritis, neutropenia and splenomegaly before you’ve noticed symptoms.
What is the average age of onset?
Felty syndrome typically develops later in life, between the ages of 50 and 70. Most people have symptoms of progressive rheumatoid arthritis for 10 to 15 years before Felty syndrome appears.
What causes Felty syndrome?
Rheumatoid arthritis is an
autoimmune disease
, and most scientists view Felty syndrome as a severe complication of RA. In autoimmune disease, your
immune system
mistakes some parts of your own body as foreign and attacks these parts with
inflammation
. Sometimes, it produces
antibodies
that bind to certain proteins in your body and tag them for removal. In this way, antibodies can accelerate inflammation.
Autoimmune antibodies aren’t always present with RA, but they’re always present with Felty syndrome. They’re also associated with more severe RA and more extra-articular manifestations in general. RA involving antibodies is called “seropositive” RA. Evidence suggests that both seropositive RA and Felty syndrome are related to certain
genetic factors
, which means they might be partly hereditary.
How does rheumatoid arthritis lead to neutropenia and splenomegaly?
Neutropenia generally happens in one of two ways: Either your
bone marrow
fails to produce enough neutrophils or your body removes the neutrophils you have. In Felty syndrome, both can occur. Autoimmune processes can interfere with your bone marrow’s production of neutrophils and destroy some of the neutrophils you have. An enlarged spleen may also remove some of your neutrophils.

Your spleen has the job of filtering and removing expired blood cells from your blood. When it grows too large, it can become
hyperactive
and remove too many blood cells. Splenomegaly sometimes occurs with rheumatoid arthritis, for reasons that aren’t always clear. It can occur without neutropenia and Felty syndrome, and Felty syndrome can also occur without splenomegaly, although it’s uncommon.
What are the serious complications of Felty syndrome?
As Felty syndrome affects your immunity, it can make you more vulnerable to persistent and severe infections. Common illnesses that you would normally be able to fight off may now become chronic and in some cases, life-threatening.
Bacterial infections
that spread uncontrollably can lead to
sepsis
. People with Felty syndrome are also at greater-than-average risk of developing certain cancers, like
lymphoma
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Felty syndrome diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose Felty syndrome when medical tests show evidence of rheumatoid arthritis, neutropenia and splenomegaly. (Occasionally, they diagnose it without splenomegaly.)
Tests typically include:
Blood tests
, including a
complete blood count
to measure your neutrophils.
X-rays
of your joints to look for evidence of arthritis.
Imaging of your spleen, such as an
ultrasound
or
CT scan
.
Bone marrow biopsy
to help rule out other diseases.

Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for Felty syndrome?
Treatment for Felty syndrome includes:
Managing the underlying rheumatoid arthritis.
Treating neutropenia directly when it’s too severe.
Preventing and treating infections.
Felty syndrome can be a consequence of untreated or ineffectively treated rheumatoid arthritis. And for many people with Felty syndrome, neutropenia improves when RA does. Healthcare providers focus on selecting effective
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
for RA while avoiding
immunosuppressants
, drugs that suppress your immune system, as much as possible.
Possible DMARDs for Felty syndrome include:
Methotrexate
with
folic acid
(to offset anti-folate side effects).
Abatacept
.
Rituximab
.
Leflunomide
.
If DMARDs fail to improve your neutropenia, or if your neutropenia is too severe or you have an active infection, your provider might try other treatments to boost your neutrophils. These might include:
G-CSF
(granulocyte colony-stimulating factor).
A short course of
corticosteroids
.
Splenectomy
(removing your overactive spleen).
Healthcare providers also take extra measures to protect you against infections, especially when your treatment plan affects your immunity. They might recommend preventive treatments, including:

Taking broad-spectrum
antibiotics
.
Getting
vaccinations
.
Taking extra care with
oral hygiene
.
If you get an infection with Felty syndrome, healthcare providers take it very seriously. You should always seek treatment for it right away. Your provider will prescribe strong medications for it.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the life expectancy or mortality rate with Felty syndrome?
There aren’t any current statistics on life expectancy or mortality with Felty syndrome. But in general, the treatment options have improved greatly in recent years, and it’s very likely one of them will work. The biggest mortality risk with Felty syndrome is still from severe infections. So, preventive measures you take to protect yourself from infections can make a real difference in your long-term prognosis.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Felty syndrome is an uncommon and little-known complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). You might develop Felty syndrome if you’ve had uncontrolled RA for a long time or if your medications have stopped working as well as they used to. Some people develop it without having had any prior symptoms. It might be alarming to learn that a condition affecting your joints can also affect your blood cell count.
When you’re already dealing with RA in your joints, and maybe in other places in your body, an additional diagnosis can feel overwhelming. But Felty syndrome doesn’t cause a lot of new symptoms, and it may not need additional treatment. It’s mostly about the risks it brings. By working with your healthcare provider to treat RA and prevent infections, you can manage Felty syndrome.
