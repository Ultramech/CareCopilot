Penile Adhesions and Skin Bridges
Penile adhesions in babies occur when the skin of the penis’s shaft sticks to the top of the penis. They can develop after a circumcision, when fat pads push penile skin forward or from friction and the warm, wet environment in a diaper. Some penile adhesions resolve on their own during infancy. Others may need steroid creams or surgery.

Overview
What are penile adhesions?
Penile adhesions in children occur when the skin on the shaft of their
penis
sticks (adheres) to the tip (glans) of their penis. It usually affects babies and can occur in
circumcised
or uncircumcised children.

What are the types of penile adhesions?
There are three types of penile adhesions:
Glanular adhesion
. A glanular adhesion is a minor type of penile adhesion. The skin on the shaft attaches to the glans. It usually goes away on its own or with minimal treatment.
Penile skin bridge
. This is a thicker, more permanent attachment. It occurs when the skin on the shaft attaches to the coronal margin. The coronal margin is the round border near the tip of the penis. A penile skin bridge usually needs treatment.
Trapped or buried penis (cicatrix adhesion)
. Generally, this occurs when too much
foreskin
(prepuce) remains after a circumcision. The penis retracts into the large fat pad in the pubic area. The penis looks trapped or buried, and it’s difficult to expose the head of the penis.
Is it normal for the foreskin to be attached to the head?
Yes, it’s normal for the foreskin to attach to the head of an uncircumcised penis. Typically, over the first several years of your child’s life, the foreskin will separate from the glans. After this occurs, you can pull the foreskin away (retract) from the head of the penis. Most children with a foreskin should be able to retract it before they reach the age of 5. But some may take longer.
Is it bad if my foreskin is still attached?
Not necessarily. But teenagers and adults whose foreskin remains attached to the head of their uncircumcised penis (
phimosis
) should reach out to a healthcare provider.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of penile adhesion?
Penile adhesion symptoms are usually mild, if there are any at all. They may include:
A tugging feeling during
erections
.
Mild pain or discomfort.
The development of
smegma
under the penile adhesion.
What causes penile adhesions?
Penile adhesions can occur for a variety of reasons. The main cause is not pushing the penile skin off the head of your child’s penis and applying petroleum jelly (Vaseline®) the first month after a circumcision.
They can also occur after circumcision if too much foreskin remains. They can also develop when fat develops in the pubic area. A large fat pad in the pubic area can push the skin of the penis, which creates a buried or trapped appearance. In some cases, diaper rash and irritation can cause penile adhesions.
Without treatment, penile adhesions can become skin bridges.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are penile adhesions diagnosed?
Penile adhesions usually don’t cause discomfort or pain, so it may not be evident that your child has a penile adhesion. In many cases,
pediatricians
notice them during a
physical examination
.
Management and Treatment
Can you get rid of penile adhesions?
Yes, you can treat a penile adhesion. Some penile adhesions may go away on their own as your infant’s penis grows and gets erections. Applying petroleum jelly can help soften the skin and cause a penile adhesion to disconnect faster during spontaneous erections.
Applying topical steroid cream around a penile adhesion can help gradually thin the skin until it separates. Steroid cream can cause discoloration (getting lighter or darker) in the surrounding penile skin. If you notice skin discoloration, stop using the steroid cream and contact a healthcare provider.
In some cases, a healthcare provider can use a scalpel (knife) to cut a skin bridge in an office setting. More serious skin bridges may require surgical separation.
How painful is penile adhesion surgery?
Penile adhesion surgery is moderately painful. Pain medications such as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and topical
anesthetics
can help reduce pain and discomfort.
How soon after treatment will it take to feel better?
Mild penile adhesions may go away with little or no recovery period. It may take up to two weeks to recover after surgery.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has a penile adhesion?
The outlook for penile adhesions is good. They’re usually mild, and they may go away on their own without treatment. Talk to your child’s pediatrician if you notice a penile adhesion. If necessary, they can recommend the proper treatment.
Prevention
Can penile adhesions be prevented?
Penile adhesions can develop from spending a lot of time in wet or sticky diapers, so it’s a good idea to change your child’s diaper regularly. You can also help prevent penile adhesions by retracting the foreskin several times per day and applying petroleum jelly.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
A penile adhesion is a typically minor condition that causes skin on the shaft of your child’s penis to stick to the head. You may feel like you did something wrong if your child develops a penile adhesion. But you shouldn’t feel that way. Penile adhesions are common in infants. Talk to a healthcare provider if you suspect your child has a penile adhesion. They can help treat it and teach you how to prevent it from happening again.
