Viral Exanthem Rash
A viral exanthem rash is spots, bumps or blotches on your skin that accompany a viral infection. It may or may not be itchy. The rash can start anywhere on the body, often on your face or trunk, and then spread. It may be associated with other virus symptoms. There’s no cure for most viral infections, so treatment aims to make you more comfortable.

Damage to your skin by the organism.
Reaction to a toxin the virus produces.

Chickenpox
(varicella-zoster virus).
COVID-19
(coronavirus).

(parvovirus B19).
Hand, foot and mouth disease
(coxsackievirus A16).

Is a viral exanthem rash contagious?
The viruses that cause viral exanthem rashes are contagious and can spread easily from person to person. Ask a healthcare provider when you or your child can go back to work, school, daycare or other activities around people.
It’s important to be especially careful around those who are pregnant and people with compromised immune systems. Immunocompromised people include those with HIV, organ transplant recipients and people receiving certain cancer treatments. Viruses can be especially dangerous to someone who is immunocompromised.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is it diagnosed?
A healthcare provider can usually diagnose a viral exanthem rash based on your symptoms. Occasionally, they may order a blood test or a swab of your nose or throat to identify the virus.
Management and Treatment
What’s the treatment for a viral exanthem rash?
Treatment aims to ease symptoms of the skin rash and other virus symptoms. For example, your healthcare provider might recommend lotions or creams to reduce itchiness, and acetaminophen or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
can lower fever and relieve body aches.
But there’s no treatment or cure for most viruses. You usually have to wait for the virus to run its course.

scars
or skin
infections
