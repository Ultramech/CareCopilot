Providers sometimes call fear of the dark scotophobia (fear of darkness) or lygophobia. Untreated, people with severe nyctophobia may avoid any situation where there isn’t enough light. They may stay indoors after the sun goes down and avoid social situations that require being out after dark.
People with nyctophobia may also have trouble sleeping (insomnia), which can lead to fatigue during the day and even trouble keeping a job. Several types of therapy can help children and adults with this disorder.
What is a phobia?
A specific phobia is a type of
anxiety disorder
. These disorders cause adults and kids to have an irrational, intense fear of something that’s actually harmless. People with phobias have extreme, unrealistic reactions to something that many other people don’t find scary.
Nyctophobia is a specific phobia disorder, which is an extreme fear of a particular situation or thing. If you have a specific phobia disorder, you may go to great lengths to avoid the object or situation that upsets you.
How common is nyctophobia?
Nyctophobia is very common, especially among children. Some researchers estimate that nearly 45% of children have an unusually strong fear of some kind. Fear of the dark is one of the most common fears among kids between 6 and 12 years old. Kids usually outgrow nyctophobia by adolescence, but not always.

Across the United States, about 9% of adults have had a specific phobia disorder in the past year. More than 12% of adults have had a specific phobia in their lifetime. In general,
females
are more likely to get specific phobic disorders. But anyone can get them.
Symptoms and Causes
Who is at risk of nyctophobia?
Nyctophobia is much more common in children than adults, but people of all ages can be afraid of the dark. Children and adults who had a traumatic or troubling experience in the dark are more likely to develop this type of phobia, especially if the event happened in the dark. Memories of that scary experience can return whenever the lights go out or even when you think about being in the dark. This means nyctophobia can develop as part of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
.
Nyctophobia can also develop after watching a scary movie or hearing an upsetting story. You (or your child) may replay these frightening images in your head. And if it’s too dark to see around you, you may worry that the fear-provoking objects are real.
You have an increased risk of developing any type of specific phobic disorder if you have:
Depression
.
Substance use disorder
.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
.
History of mental illness.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
.
Other phobias or a history of phobias in your family.
Panic attacks or
panic disorder
.
What causes nyctophobia?
Some researchers believe that fear of the dark probably dates back to our ancestors. Many, many years ago, when our ancestors lived and slept out in the open, the dark was very dangerous. Predators roamed at night, and our ancestors had to stay aware in order to survive.
But nyctophobia isn’t just about being afraid of the dark. Kids and adults with this phobia actually have a fear of what they can’t see. In the dark, many children are afraid of ghosts, monsters or robbers. They may worry about noises they hear when the lights are out, especially if they can’t tell what caused them. They fear what’s in the dark as much as they fear the darkness itself.
A traumatic experience (even one that happened during the day) can lead to nyctophobia. The memory of a scary event can return when it’s dark, causing an extreme reaction.
What are the triggers of nyctophobia?
Nearly everyone feels uneasy or uncomfortable in the dark from time to time. But a specific phobia is more than just an occasional fear. Phobias get in the way of everyday life. Children and adults with nyctophobia often have severe anxiety when:
Entering a dark place (like a movie theater).
Getting ready for bed.
Seeing the sun go down.
Thinking about being in the dark.
Trying to sleep at night.
Turning out the lights.
Watching a movie or TV show with nighttime scenes.

Diagnosis and Tests

To diagnose this phobia, your provider will ask about your symptoms (or your child’s symptoms), including when they began and when they occur. Tell your provider about any scary or traumatic experiences you’ve had, even if they occurred during daylight.
Your provider will want to know if nyctophobia is affecting your sleep and daily activities. They'll also ask about any other phobias you have or if you have a family history of phobias.
Your provider may refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in phobias. A mental health professional is an expert who is specially trained to diagnose phobias. They also help with other anxiety disorders.

Management and Treatment
How do providers treat nyctophobia?
Sleeping with a nightlight can help some children and adults feel more comfortable in a darkened room. Sometimes, just having a little light is enough to help people with nyctophobia fall asleep and stay asleep.
If you have insomnia, your provider may recommend
melatonin supplements
or other medications to help you sleep. If you had a traumatic experience that’s causing distress, your provider will recommend therapy or counseling to help you understand your feelings and learn to manage them. You may also need
medications
to treat depression or control panic attacks.
Several types of therapy can help people with a severe fear of the dark, including:
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
,
to learn to change how you respond to your fear of the dark.
Exposure therapy,
which involves gradually exposing you to the dark so you can become desensitized to it. It’s important to do this therapy under the supervision of your provider.
Hypnotherapy
,
which helps you rethink your fear of the dark and the anxiety it causes. Hypnotherapy includes guided relaxation exercises while your mind is in a calm state.
Psychotherapy,
or talk therapy, to help you understand your fears and manage them.
Mindfulness exercises,
like yoga,
breathing exercises
and
meditation
to help you control anxiety when you’re in the dark.

What are the complications of nyctophobia?
Nyctophobia often goes hand-in-hand with
insomnia
. People who have trouble sleeping may develop a fear of the dark, and people who have a fear of the dark often have trouble sleeping. They can develop extreme anxiety when they turn off the lights or even close their eyes.
To avoid the dark, people with nyctophobia may try to sleep with the lights on. But sleeping with the lights on can make it very difficult to get restful sleep.
Too little sleep can cause extreme
fatigue
. Being exhausted during the day can make it difficult to hold down a job. Untreated, nyctophobia can cause problems with relationships, especially if you avoid leaving your house after dark because of your fears.
Sleeping difficulties interfere with your child’s development and can lead to behavioral or learning issues. They can also affect your child’s growth.
