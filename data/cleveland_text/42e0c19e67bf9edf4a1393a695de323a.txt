XLH (X-Linked Hypophosphatemia)
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a genetic condition that weakens your bones and teeth. It can also cause muscle weakness, hearing loss and other issues. A genetic mutation that leads to your body losing too much bone-strengthening phosphate causes XLH. Treatments include burosumab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, and physical therapy to keep your bones strong.

Overview
What is X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH)?
X-linked hypophosphatemia (pronounced “high-po-faas-fuh-TEE-mee-uh”), or XLH, is a
genetic disease
that causes issues with your
bones
and teeth. It’s a form of
rickets
. Children with XLH often have difficulty walking and can have bowed legs. It can also cause muscle weakness, hearing loss and other issues.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of XLH?
Signs and symptoms of XLH usually first appear in young kids and include:
Difficulty walking or delay in learning how to walk.
Bowing legs or knees that tilt toward each other (knock knees).
Bone
and
muscle pain
.
Short stature.
Low energy levels.
Muscle weakness.
Dental issues like very early loss of baby teeth, tooth pain,
abscesses
or frequent
cavities.
Physical differences in head or face shape (due to
craniosynostosis
).
As you get older, adults may experience additional signs and symptoms of XLH, including:
Hearing loss
.
Headaches.
Spinal stenosis
.
Osteomalacia
.
Balance or walking issues.
Loss of adult teeth.
Hardening of
ligaments
or
tendons
.
Joint stiffness.
Fatigue.
Bone fractures
and pseudofractures (areas that look like broken bones on X-rays but aren’t).
What causes X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH)?
A gene change (
genetic mutation
) in the
PHEX
gene causes XLH. The
PHEX
gene creates FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23), a
hormone
that helps your body regulate its amount of phosphate. Phosphate is an element that keeps your bones healthy. FGF23 tells your kidneys to get rid of excess phosphate in your pee if your body has all that it needs. Your body will make less FGF23 if it needs more phosphate.
The mutation in
PHEX
causes your body to make too much FGF23 hormone. The excess hormones make your body get rid of more phosphate than it should. This leads to symptoms of XLH.

Is XLH inherited?
The mutation that causes XLH is inherited in an X-linked
autosomal dominant
pattern. This means anyone who has a gene with the mutation will have the disease. It more severely affects
males
.
Females have two X
chromosomes
and males have one X and one Y. Because you inherit one sex chromosome (an X or a Y) from each of your biological parents:
A female who has XLH usually has a 50% chance of passing the gene on to any biological children.
A male will pass the gene on to any female biological children but not to male children.
Sometimes, there are cases of XLH that aren’t inherited from a biological parent. In this case, the gene mutation is random and neither parent has XLH.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is XLH diagnosed?
To diagnose XLH, a provider might order or perform these tests:
Blood
or
pee (urine) tests
to check phosphate and FGF23 levels.
Genetic testing
.
Bone density tests
.
X-rays
or other imaging tests.
Management and Treatment
How do you treat XLH?
There’s no cure for XLH. Treatments aim to keep your bones healthy — not to increase phosphate levels to typical levels (which might not be possible). Treatments might include:
Phosphate supplements and
calcitriol
(vitamin D).
Burosumab
, a
monoclonal antibody
treatment that blocks FGF23.
Physical therapy (PT)
.
Occupational therapy (OT)
.
Surgery to correct bone deformities.
Growth hormones
(to treat short stature).
Hearing aids
(if needed).
Additionally, you may need surgery or other procedures for broken bones or dental issues as they come up.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have XLH?
If you or your child have XLH, monitoring the condition and getting treatment early can help prevent complications. Sometimes, certain bone deformities may correct on their own or not cause any issues. Other times, they may require corrective procedures or physical therapy. Ask your provider what to expect.
What’s the life expectancy for someone with XLH?
Studies suggest
that the life expectancy of someone with XLH is shorter by about eight years compared to someone without it. But experts aren’t sure what causes this difference in lifespan.
Prevention
Can XLH be prevented?
You can’t prevent XLH. But babies diagnosed and treated with burosumab right away can grow normally and free of symptoms. If you have XLH and want to know more about the chances of passing it on to future children, talk to a
genetic counselor
.
Living With
How do I take care of myself with XLH?
Some tips for taking care of yourself with XLH include:
Get genetic testing. A positive test will allow you to start medication as soon as possible.
Get regular dental care. This can help catch issues with your teeth and gums early.
Attend all of your healthcare appointments and follow-ups. This includes PT and OT. Let them know about any new or worsening symptoms.
Take any medications as prescribed. Let your provider know if you have any questions about how to take them or if you experience side effects.
Get physical activity as recommended by your provider. They can help you select safe activities that strengthen your bones.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have concerns about your child’s health, or about them meeting their
developmental milestones
, talk to their
pediatrician
. They can recommend additional testing if needed.
If you have XLH, contact your provider if you have any new or worsening symptoms.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to a dentist if you experience a
dental emergency
, including:
Severe
toothache.
Badly cracked or broken tooth.
Extruded (partially dislodged) tooth.
Dental abscess (swelling of your face and jaw).
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:
What are my/my child’s treatment options?
How do I take care of my/my child’s bone health?
When should I go to the ER?
When should I follow up with you?
Additional Common Questions
Do kids with XLH go through puberty?
Yes, kids with XLH go through puberty and have growth spurts as any other kid would.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A diagnosis of a lifelong condition can be scary. You may wonder about your child’s future — or your future — with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). But people with XLH can live long, healthy lives. Early diagnosis and treatment can help keep your bones healthy and strong. Don’t hesitate to talk to your provider about any concerns you have.
