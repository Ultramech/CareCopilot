Flat Warts
Flat warts are smooth, small bumps on your skin. They’re flatter and smaller than other warts and usually appear in groups on your face or hands. Four different strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) cause flat warts. Flat warts don’t usually require treatment. They’ll usually go away on their own, but it may take several months or even years.

Overview
What is a flat wart?
Flat warts are smooth, small noncancerous (benign) bumps on your skin. They’re flatter and smaller than other
warts
— each one is about the size of a pinhead. They may be yellowish-brown, pink or skin-colored. Flat warts usually appear in groups. There may be anywhere from a dozen to a hundred in one area.

These flat types of warts are most common on your face and the top of your hands. They may also spread by shaving. For this reason, they may appear on the beard area in
males
and on the legs of females. A flat wart doesn’t usually cause any pain, but it can be difficult to treat.
Who do flat warts affect?
Flat warts are sometimes referred to as juvenile warts because they appear in children and teenagers more often than in adults.
Symptoms and Causes
What do flat warts look like?
Flat warts typically appear on your face and the back of your hands. They may also show up on your neck or legs after nicking your
skin
after shaving. They surround scratches and cuts. You may also get flat warts on your fingers and arms.
Flat warts are skin-colored — often yellow, brown or pinkish. They’re very small — between 1 and 5 millimeters (mm) across — no bigger than the head of a pin. They’re smaller than other warts and smooth on top.
Flat warts may be round or oval-shaped. They’re only very slightly raised, sometimes not even noticeable. They almost always appear in groups or clusters of up to 100 or more.
What causes flat warts?
The
human papillomavirus (HPV)
causes flat warts. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Specifically, HPV types 3, 10, 28 and 49 cause flat warts. These strains of HPV are noncancerous (benign). They’re not caused by the same strain of HPV that causes
genital warts
.

HPV survives in warm, damp environments. When the virus infects your body, it grows and thrives on areas of your skin because it’s warm and moist. The virus causes the thickening of the top layer of your skin.
What are the risk factors for developing flat warts?
You’re more likely to develop flat warts if you have skin-to-skin contact with a person who has them. Other risk factors include:
Touching an object that has come into contact with HPV.
Having open cuts and scrapes.
Exercising poor hygiene.
Having a weakened
immune system
.
Are flat warts contagious?
Yes. The virus that causes flat warts (HPV) is contagious. It’s not highly contagious, but it can spread through skin-to-skin contact. HPV can enter your body through a small break, cut or scratch on your skin. You can also spread flat warts from one part of your body to another. Rarely, you can contract HPV by touching contaminated objects or surfaces.
You can take several steps to avoid contracting warts:
Don’t share clothing, towels or other personal items with others.
Avoid skin-to-skin contact with someone with warts.
Wear shower shoes or flip-flops in public locker rooms.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are flat warts diagnosed?
If you’re concerned about any lumps or bumps on your skin, you should make an appointment to see your healthcare provider. They may be able to diagnose flat warts by their appearance. However, sometimes they may request a
biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis. They may refer you to a skin doctor (
dermatologist
) for treatment.
Management and Treatment
How do I get rid of flat warts?
Flat warts don’t usually require treatment. They’ll usually go away on their own, but it may take several months or even years. The length of time it takes for them to clear up depends on several factors, including your overall health and where the warts are located on your body. Up to 78% of flat warts reportedly disappear within two years.
If you want to treat flat warts sooner, you have options, such as over-the-counter (OTC)
wart removers
. These medications contain salicylic acid and work by dissolving away the layer of skin the HPV virus has infected. But scientific evidence doesn’t confirm their effectiveness and they can irritate your skin.
You should have flat warts checked out by your healthcare provider if they’re painful, spreading or affecting your quality of life. Your provider can discuss various options with you to remove flat warts. Keep in mind that removal methods may not completely destroy the warts. In fact, they can sometimes cause warts to spread or the warts may reappear later. Treatment can cause also pain and
scarring
.
To get rid of flat warts on your face or hands, your provider may suggest a gentle treatment to avoid scarring. They can prescribe a topical cream designed to irritate your skin so you can peel the warts away. These creams may contain retinoic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Other wart removal options include:

Burning:
Your healthcare provider will use an electric needle (electrocautery) or a
laser
to remove the warts.
Cryotherapy
:
Your provider will use liquid nitrogen to freeze the warts and then remove them.
Cantharidin:
Your provider will apply cantharidin to the warts. Cantharidin is a chemical that causes
blisters
to form under the warts and lift them from your skin.
Surgical removal (excision):
Your provider will cut or scrape away the warts with a scalpel.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have flat warts?
Most flat warts don’t cause any pain or other symptoms. They usually go away on their own, but it may take months or years for them to completely disappear.

In addition, flat warts tend to return after treatment.
Prevention
How can I prevent flat warts?

Avoid rubbing, picking or scratching any flat warts.
Wash your hands
after touching warts.
Keep your hands clean and dry.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Flat warts are tiny, flat bumps that show up mostly on your face or hands. They’re so small (and painless) that you may not even notice them. They’ll usually go away on their own within a few months, but it can take years for them to completely clear up. If flat warts bother you, cause pain or look infected, reach out to your healthcare provider. They can recommend the best treatment option for you. However, keep in mind that flat warts can spread and commonly return even after treatment.
