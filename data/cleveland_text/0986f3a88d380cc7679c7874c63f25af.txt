Medullary Thyroid Cancer
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) forms in the inside of your thyroid gland, which is called the medulla. It’s the rarest type of thyroid cancer. While most cases are sporadic (random), about 25% of cases are linked to an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.

Overview
Medullary thyroid cancer happens when C cells inside your thyroid grow out of control.
What is medullary thyroid cancer?
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is
cancer
that forms inside your
thyroid
gland. The inside is called the medulla. It contains special cells called parafollicular C cells that make
calcitonin
, a
hormone
. MTC happens when the C cells grow out of control.

Hearing you might have cancer can leave you with many questions and worries, especially when it’s rare. Know that your healthcare team will be by your side along the way. Several therapies can help treat MTC.
How common is medullary thyroid cancer?
Thyroid cancer
, in general, is fairly common. But medullary thyroid cancer, specifically, is rare. Approximately 4% to 10% of all thyroid cancers in the United States are MTC. About 1,000 people receive an MTC diagnosis each year in the U.S.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of medullary thyroid cancer?
Symptoms of medullary thyroid cancer include:
A
nodule
(lump) on the upper part of your thyroid gland (75% to 95% of people have this at diagnosis)
Swollen lymph nodes
in your neck (70% of people have this at diagnosis)
In rare cases, an enlarged thyroid nodule can cause:
Hoarseness
Difficulty swallowing
Breathing issues
In some cases, people have MTC for a long time before they notice symptoms. This is because the
tumor
remains small.
What causes medullary thyroid cancer?
About 75% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases (3 in 4) are sporadic. This means it happens in people who don’t have a family history of MTC. Scientists haven’t yet figured out the exact cause of sporadic MTC. But 40% to 50% of people with sporadic MTC have acquired
mutations
in the
RET
gene. This means you develop the genetic mutation later in life — you aren’t born with it.

In up to 25% of cases (1 in 4), MTC is due to an inherited condition called
multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 2 (MEN2). There are different subtypes of MEN2, including:
MEN2A
. People with MEN2A have a high chance (90%) of getting MTC.
MEN2B
. Some cases of MEN2B are inherited. But most of the time, it isn’t. People with MEN2B have an 100% chance of getting MTC at a very young age.
There’s also a subvariant of MEN2B called familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC). People with FMTC have a
RET
gene mutation but only develop MTC (not other tumors).
If you have the
RET
gene mutation, you may be able to get preventive surgery to remove your thyroid gland before cancer develops.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is medullary thyroid cancer diagnosed?
Medullary thyroid cancer usually presents as a lump or nodule on your thyroid gland. You may notice it, or your healthcare provider may discover it during a routine neck exam. Sometimes, providers discover it accidentally with imaging tests you get for other reasons.
Your provider will likely recommend the following tests to help diagnose MTC:
Imaging tests
. Imaging tests can help identify the nodule on your thyroid. These tests might include thyroid
ultrasound
, a
CT scan
and/or
MRI
.
Fine needle aspiration (needle biopsy)
. Your provider will likely want to take a small tissue sample (biopsy) from the nodule on your thyroid. They’ll use a very thin needle.
Blood tests
. These may include tests that measure your levels of calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These levels are typically elevated in people with MTC.
Your provider may also recommend
genetic testing
to see if you have MEN2. If you do, they’ll recommend genetic testing for your biological family members, as well.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for medullary thyroid cancer?
The main treatment for MTC is surgery to remove your entire thyroid gland (total
thyroidectomy
).
If the thyroid cancer has spread (
metastasized
) to
lymph nodes
in your neck, your surgeon will likely
remove them
, as well. After surgery, you’ll need to take
thyroid hormone
replacement medications for the rest of your life.
Other than surgery, your healthcare provider may recommend other treatments, including:
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapies
that act on changes in DNA found in some cases of MTC (
vandetanib
and
cabozantinib
)
After treatment for MTC, your provider will check your levels of CEA and calcitonin through blood tests. This way, they can keep track of how well the treatment is working or if the cancer has come back.
MTC is usually more aggressive than the other, more common types of thyroid cancer. It’s easier to treat and manage if it’s found before it spreads to lymph nodes in your neck or other parts of your body.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for someone with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)?
The prognosis (outlook) for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) depends on several factors, including:
Advertisement
The stage of the cancer
If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body (metastasized)
How much of the tumor was taken out during surgery
Your age and overall health
The prognosis of MTC is usually not as good as
papillary
and
follicular thyroid cancers
. But if you and your provider discover MTC early, surgery can cure it. Even if the diagnosis is delayed, MTC often progresses (gets worse) relatively slowly.
A worse prognosis may affect those:
Who are over 65 years
Have late-stage cancer
Have incomplete surgical removal of the tumor
What is the life expectancy of medullary thyroid cancer?
Current research estimates that the five-year
survival rate
for stages 1 to 3 of medullary thyroid cancer is 93%. It’s 28% for stage 4.
It’s important to note that since there are so few new MTC cases diagnosed each year, these survival rates may not be very accurate. Your healthcare team will give you a better idea of what to expect.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between papillary and medullary thyroid cancer?
Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type of thyroid cancer. It represents about 80% of all thyroid cancer diagnoses. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is rare.
Papillary thyroid cancer begins in the thyroglobulin-producing follicular cells in your thyroid. MTC arises from calcitonin-producing cells in your thyroid. Thyroglobulin is a protein, and calcitonin is a hormone.

Papillary thyroid cancer is often linked to radiation exposure, whereas MTC isn’t.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Receiving a cancer diagnosis is unsettling, regardless of the type. Fortunately, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) generally responds well to treatment if it’s caught early. While most MTC cases have an unknown cause, there’s a significant link to certain inherited conditions. If you or one of your first-degree relatives has been diagnosed with MTC, it’s important to get genetic testing. If you have questions about your risk of developing MTC, talk to your healthcare provider. They’re available to help you.
