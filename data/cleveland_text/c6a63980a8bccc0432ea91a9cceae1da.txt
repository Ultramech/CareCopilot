You might hear about outbreaks of legionellosis, where many people get sick from one place. But most cases are sporadic (only affect one person). It also usually only affects people with certain health conditions.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Pontiac fever?
Symptoms of Pontiac fever include:
Fever
Body aches
Headache
Chills
Tiredness (
fatigue
) or lack of energy (malaise)
Less common symptoms include:
Dizziness
or
vertigo
Sensitivity to light (
photophobia
)
Neck stiffness
Confusion
Digestive symptoms, like nausea,
vomiting
and
diarrhea
What causes Pontiac fever?
Legionella
bacteria causes Pontiac fever.
Legionella
is found naturally in lakes, streams and soil, but it can also contaminate drinking water and air systems, especially in large buildings.
How do you get Pontiac fever?
You can get Pontiac fever by breathing in a mist of water droplets that contain
Legionella
bacteria. You might breathe in water mist from:
Shower heads
Faucets
Commercial air conditioning (but not home or car air conditioning)
Windshield wiper fluid, especially if it’s replaced with mostly water
Hot tubs
Decorative water features
Water tanks and heaters
Large plumbing systems
Rarely, you can get it from aspirating the bacteria (when water “goes down the wrong pipe”) from drinking water.
Is Pontiac fever contagious?
No, Pontiac fever isn’t contagious (it doesn’t spread from one person to another).

What are the risk factors for Pontiac fever?
Most people don’t get sick from breathing in
Legionella
. But some health conditions and other factors can put you at risk. You’re at a higher risk for Pontiac fever if you:
Smoke
or used to smoke
Are 50 or older
Have a compromised immune system
Have certain health conditions, including cancer, COPD or other chronic lung diseases, diabetes, and kidney or liver failure
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Pontiac fever diagnosed?
A healthcare provider might use the following tests to diagnose Pontiac fever:
Lab tests
. Your provider can test
your pee (urine)
or
mucus
coughed up from your lungs (sputum) to look for
Legionella
bacteria. A lab will try to
grow (culture) bacteria
on the sputum sample.
Chest X-ray
. Providers can use a chest X-ray to look for pneumonia.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
. PCR can detect small amounts of genetic material from the virus in fluid from your respiratory tract.
Since the symptoms are similar to many other illnesses, you might only be tested if there’s a known outbreak of legionellosis that could affect you.
Management and Treatment
How is Pontiac fever treated?
Providers usually don’t treat Pontiac fever. It goes away on its own. Providers treat more serious forms of legionellosis with
antibiotics
.
How do I take care of myself at home?
You can usually manage symptoms of Pontiac fever at home with over-the-counter medications, like
pain relievers
and fever reducers.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the mortality rate of Pontiac fever?
Pontiac fever isn’t fatal. It should go away on its own in about a week.
Prevention
Can Pontiac fever be prevented?
You can reduce your risk of Pontiac fever at home by making sure shower heads, faucets, hot tubs and humidifiers are properly cleaned. Don’t use tap water in place of windshield wiper fluid in your car.
Building managers can reduce the risk of Pontiac fever by maintaining and properly disinfecting water and ventilation systems.
Additional Common Questions
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to your provider if there’s an outbreak of legionellosis — including Legionnaires’ disease — and you have symptoms of Pontiac fever. They can help you manage your symptoms and decide if you need antibiotics or other care.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room or call 911 if you experience:
Shortness of breath (
dyspnea
)
New or worsening
chest pain
Confusion or inability to think clearly
High fever (104 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius)
Bluish or grayish skin, lips or nails (
cyanosis
)
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Outbreaks of
Legionella
-related illnesses can generate scary headlines. It might be reassuring to know that Pontiac fever is uncommon and isn’t serious. If there’s an outbreak of illness caused by
Legionella
where you’ve worked or stayed, talk to your healthcare provider about your risk and symptoms to look out for.
