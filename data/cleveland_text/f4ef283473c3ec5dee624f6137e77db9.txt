Parotitis

Parotid gland swelling is often associated with
mumps
(which is sometimes called viral parotitis). But parotitis can be a symptom of numerous other conditions, including salivary gland stones,
autoimmune diseases
, dental problems and viral and bacterial infections. The condition may be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).
Who does parotitis affect?
Parotitis can affect people of all ages, especially because parotid gland swelling is a symptom of many underlying conditions, including the
flu
,
HIV
,
staph infections
and
COVID-19
. Parotitis affects people of all races equally.
Viral acute parotitis (mumps) is most common in children, though its occurrence has decreased since the invention of the
MMR vaccine
.
How does parotitis affect my body?
A person with parotitis develops severe swelling on the side of their face. In most cases, the swelling occurs on both sides (bilateral). But some people only develop a swollen parotid gland on one side (unilateral).
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a swollen parotid gland?
Symptoms of a swollen parotid gland can vary depending on the underlying condition. Some of the most common parotitis symptoms include:
Pain where the gland is swollen.
Fever
.
Chills
.
Headache
.
Sore throat
.
General malaise or
tiredness
.
Loss of appetite.
Dry mouth
or
dry eyes
(usually associated with
Sjogren’s syndrome
).

Most people with acute parotitis have extremely tender parotid glands. Those with chronic parotitis usually don’t have much pain or discomfort.
What causes the parotid gland to swell?
There are many reasons why a person’s parotid gland might swell, though the risk factors aren’t always clear. Parotid gland swelling may be associated with:
Mumps.
Herpes.
Epstein-Barr
.
Influenza.
COVID-19.
Staph infections.
Candida or other fungal infections.
Diabetes
.
Salivary gland inflammation (
sialadenitis
).
Salivary gland stones (
sialolithiasis
).
Salivary gland tumors.
Poor
oral hygiene
.
Dehydration
.
Sjogren’s syndrome.
Sarcoidosis
.
Tuberculosis
.
Cystic fibrosis
.
Anorexia
.
Bulimia
.
Certain drugs, like some
antihistamines
,
antidepressants
and antipsychotics.
HIV.
Trauma to your
mouth
.
Bruxism
(teeth grinding or clenching).
Dental
malocclusion
(when your bite is “off”).
Alcohol use disorder
.
Smoking
or tobacco use.
What virus causes parotitis?
Many different viruses can cause parotid gland swelling. But the most common is
MuV
— the virus that causes mumps. Other viruses include herpes, HIV, Epstein-Barr and COVID-19.
Is parotitis contagious?
When parotitis is the result of a viral or bacterial infection, it can easily be spread to others through saliva (spit) droplets. If you have infectious parotitis, don’t share personal items such as towels, eating utensils or cups. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions thoroughly and take all medications exactly as prescribed.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is parotitis diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will visually examine your face. They may gently press on the
skin
in front of your ears and along your jawline.
To confirm a parotitis diagnosis, the provider may also massage your parotid gland from the back to the front. This helps them determine if drainage (pus) is present in your saliva.
Next, they’ll perform bacterial culture testing to figure out the best course of treatment. For example, if
bacteria
are found in the drainage, then they’ll prescribe antibiotics to treat the condition.
Management and Treatment
What is the best treatment for parotitis?
When parotitis is caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection, your healthcare provider will prescribe the appropriate medication (
antivirals
,
antibiotics
or
antifungals
). Over-the-counter
pain relievers
— such as
acetaminophen
and
ibuprofen
— can help ease tenderness or discomfort. Your provider may also recommend massaging or applying heat to your swollen parotid glands.
Otherwise, parotitis treatment largely depends on the underlying condition. For example, if parotitis is associated with an autoimmune disease, your provider will probably recommend
steroids
. If parotitis is due to salivary gland stones, eating sour foods (like lemon candy) can sometimes help.

When nonsurgical treatments don’t work, a parotidectomy may be necessary. A
parotidectomy
is a surgery to remove all or part of your parotid gland. Typically, surgery is reserved for people with
parotid gland tumors
or parotid gland cancers.
Will parotitis go away on its own?
In some cases, parotid gland swelling goes away on its own. Your healthcare provider may recommend treatments to ease your symptoms and speed up your recovery.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have parotitis?
The outlook for people with parotitis is typically good with treatment. The condition usually lasts about seven to 10 days. Even without treatment, most people fully recover without complications.
Prevention
How can I prevent parotitis?
The best way to prevent acute parotitis is to get the MMR vaccine. To reduce your risk of other types of parotitis:
Stay hydrated.
Wash your hands frequently.
Get adequate nutrition.
Practice good oral hygiene.
Don’t smoke.
Avoid alcohol.
Practice safe sex.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you develop severe facial swelling, you should see a healthcare provider immediately — especially if your symptoms include fever, chills or other signs of infection.
Because parotitis can exhibit the same symptoms as
salivary gland cancer
, it’s important to seek proper diagnosis and treatment right away.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?
If you develop parotitis, here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider:
Advertisement
What caused my parotid gland to swell?
Do I have a parotid gland infection? If so, is it viral, bacterial or fungal?
Will I need a prescription?
What can I take for pain?
How long should I stay home from work or school?
Do I need surgery?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Parotitis isn’t usually dangerous, but it can be very uncomfortable. If you have a parotid gland infection, you should isolate yourself until you’re no longer contagious. Most people recover within 10 days. Because parotitis is often a symptom of an underlying condition, it’s important to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
