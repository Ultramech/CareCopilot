Overview
Antiphospholipid syndrome makes you much more likely to develop blood clots.
What is antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)?
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a condition that makes your body much more likely than usual to form
blood clots
. Healthcare providers sometimes call it antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

The blood clots from APS can cause severe, life-threatening complications like
strokes
. They can also make it more likely to experience
miscarriages
and other pregnancy complications.
APS is an
autoimmune disease
. Autoimmune diseases happen when your
immune system
accidentally attacks your body instead of protecting it.
Symptoms and Causes
What are antiphospholipid syndrome symptoms?
Some people with antiphospholipid syndrome notice
mottled skin
(livedo reticulitis) with a darkened, lace-like pattern. But most people with APS don’t experience any noticeable symptoms until they have a blood clot or experience a pregnancy complication.
Symptoms of a blood clot can include:
Chest pain
.
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
.
Frequent
headaches
.
Sudden pain in your arms, legs, back, neck or jaw.
Redness or swelling in your arm or leg.
Abdominal pain (a stomachache)
.
Blood clots can be life-threatening emergencies. Go to the emergency room right away if you think you have a blood clot.
APS symptoms you might not be able to see, feel or notice can include having:
Low
blood platelet
levels.
Anemia
.
Heart valve
abnormalities.
What causes antiphospholipid syndrome?
Antiphospholipid syndrome happens when your immune system accidentally starts making certain abnormal
antibodies
. Usually, your immune system makes and uses antibodies to protect you. They’re special proteins that act like an army of security robots that find and destroy
germs
, allergens or toxins in your blood. When your immune system detects a new unwanted substance in your body, it makes antibodies customized to find and destroy that invader.

Antiphospholipid syndrome gets its name from how your immune system attacks your body. If you have APS, your immune system makes antibodies that attack proteins bound to phospholipids (a type of fat cell). These attacks damage the phospholipids and make them more likely to clump together and form clots.
The three antibodies that can cause APS include:
Lupus anticoagulant.
Anticardiolipin.
Anti-B2 glycoprotein 1.
People with APS have one, two or all three of these antiphospholipid antibodies. It’s also possible to have antiphospholipid antibodies and never have signs or symptoms of APS. Even though experts know they cause APS, they aren’t sure what triggers your immune system to start making these faulty antibodies.
What are the risk factors?
Anyone can develop APS, but you may be more likely to if you:
Are
female
.
Are between 30 and 40 years old.
Have other autoimmune diseases like
lupus
or
rheumatoid arthritis
.
Have close family members (including biological parents and grandparents) with APS.
What are APS syndrome complications?
Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause severe, potentially fatal complications.
The most severe APS complications happen when blood clots block
blood vessels
throughout your body, including in your:
Brain (
strokes
).
Heart (
thrombosis
).
Lungs (
pulmonary embolism
).
Kidneys.
If you’re pregnant, APS may cause a miscarriage if a clot blocks the flow of nutrients in your
placenta
. It can also increase your risk of
preeclampsia
.
Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is an APS complication that causes multiple blood clots to form in different organs throughout your body within a few days of each other. CAPS is fatal in almost half of people who experience it. Fewer than 1% of people with APS develop CAPS.
What is the life expectancy of someone with antiphospholipid syndrome?
APS doesn’t usually affect how long you’ll live (your life expectancy). It can cause fatal complications if you experience a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel in one of your organs, especially if you have CAPS.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome?
Most people are only tested for APS after a blood clot or miscarriage. Some people have antiphospholipid antibodies but never experience APS symptoms or complications.
A healthcare provider will diagnose APS with
blood tests
.
Your provider will take samples of your blood for three different blood tests — one test that screens for each of the three antiphospholipid antibodies. At least one of the blood tests must come back positive for APS two different times three months or more apart for you to be diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome.

Management and Treatment
What is the best treatment for antiphospholipid syndrome?
Your provider will suggest treatments that lower your risk of having a blood clot. The most common treatments include
anticoagulant medications (blood thinners)
, including:
Heparin
:
This is an intravenous (IV) medication that helps break up clots while you have one. A provider will usually give it to you if you’ve been hospitalized for having a blood clot.
Warfarin
:
This is a medication you’ll take orally (by mouth) that thins your blood and helps prevent clots before they form.
Aspirin
:
Your provider may suggest you take over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription aspirin to prevent clots in your
arteries
.
Your provider might recommend medications to prevent miscarriages if you’re pregnant and have APS, including:
Enoxaparin
:
This is a medication your provider will inject under your skin. They might suggest you take a low-dose aspirin, too.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
:
IVIG can reduce your risk of getting sick and lessen the severity of illnesses when you do get them.
Corticosteroids
:
Corticosteroids are prescription medications that reduce inflammation and calm (suppress) your immune system.
These treatments are safe if you're pregnant and shouldn’t harm you or the fetus.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have APS?
APS responds well to treatment with blood thinners, and you should be able to do all your usual activities once you start treatment. Most people managing APS with blood thinners can safely get pregnant and have biological children.
Does antiphospholipid syndrome go away?
APS doesn’t usually go away. You may never have a clot or experience complications, but you’ll probably need to take blood thinners for the rest of your life.
Prevention
Can I prevent antiphospholipid syndrome?
Because experts aren’t sure what makes your body produce the antiphospholipid antibodies that cause it, there’s no way to prevent APS.
Living With
How do I take care of myself if I have antiphospholipid syndrome?
The most important part of living with APS is preventing blood clots. Taking blood-thinning medication is a big part of that prevention.
Managing other health conditions that can increase your clot risk is also important. Talk to your provider about your unique clot risks if you have:
Advertisement
Diabetes
.
High blood pressure (hypertension)
.
High cholesterol
.
Obesity
.
Other autoimmune diseases.
Smoking
also increases your risk of blood clots, especially if you have a clotting disorder like APS.
People who take
estrogen therapy
(for
birth control
or during
menopause
) also have an increased clot risk.
What foods should you avoid if you have APS?
People with APS don’t usually need to follow a special eating plan. The same kinds of food that help you maintain good overall health should help support your body if you have APS.
You may need to monitor how much vitamin K you eat if you take warfarin. Suddenly eating a lot of foods high in vitamin K (like leafy greens) when you usually don’t can increase your clot risk. Talk to your provider about any foods you should avoid.
Ask your provider how much alcohol is safe for you to drink. Alcohol thins your blood, and this effect can be increased when you’re taking blood thinners.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You’ll need to see your provider regularly to make sure your blood is still able to clot safely if you get a cut or bruise.
Antiphospholipid syndrome can increase the risk of pregnancy-related complications. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re concerned about any risks or pregnancy complications you might experience.
When should I go to the emergency room?
Go to the ER right away if you:
Think you have a blood clot.
Experience any symptoms of a clot.
Are bleeding and can’t control it.
Which questions should I ask my provider?
It may be helpful to ask your provider:
Do I have APS or another clotting disorder?
Which medications will help me prevent blood clots?
How often will I need follow-up appointments?
What are my risks for pregnancy complications?
Which warning signs of complications or clots should I watch out for?
Additional Common Questions
Does having antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) mean I have lupus?
Although part of the testing for APS is called “
lupus anticoagulant
,” your healthcare provider isn’t specifically testing for lupus when ordering tests for APS. Some people with lupus also have APS, which is where this term originated.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Antiphospholipid syndrome can feel like a ticking clock inside your body that you can’t see or feel until it causes a blood clot. It’s scary, but it’s manageable. Having a condition (even a serious one) doesn’t define who you are. Most people taking blood thinners are able to do everything they want to in life — including having biological children.
Talk to your healthcare provider about what to watch for, how you can prevent clots and what to do if you experience one.
