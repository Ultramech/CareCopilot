Overview
What are emollients?
Emollients are ingredients in skin care products that soothe dryness or irritation. Emollients are also called barrier creams because they form a film on your skin’s outer layer. Healthcare providers often recommend emollients for skin conditions that cause scaling or dryness, such as eczema and psoriasis.

What do emollients do?
Skin care creams, lotions and ointments that contain emollients can:
Attract moisture (water) to your skin.
Prevent the loss of moisture in your skin.
Soften scaling or peeling skin.
Soothe irritated or dry skin.
What’s the difference between an emollient and a moisturizer?
An emollient is an ingredient in moisturizer. The job of the emollient is to soften skin. Moisturizers contain other ingredients that help bring water into your skin.
What are the types of emollients?
There are two main types of emollients, and many moisturizing skin care products contain a combination of both:
Occlusives
form a thick and greasy coating on your skin and don’t dissolve in water. Examples of occlusives include petroleum jelly, mineral oil,
lanolin
and liquid paraffin. Occlusives don’t add moisture to your skin but help it hold onto the moisture it already has.
Humectants
attract and bind water to your skin, increasing its moisture. These ingredients feel less thick and greasy than occlusives but wash off more easily in water. Examples of humectants are glycerin, hyaluronic acid, propylene glycol and
urea
.
What conditions can emollients treat?
Emollients can help relieve symptoms of skin conditions that cause dryness, cracking or scaling, including:
Dermatitis
.
Eczema
.
Psoriasis
.
Emollients can also help with
dry skin
due to:
Cancer treatment
.
Cold, dry air.
Diabetes
.
Frequent hand washing.
Working with chemicals.

Treatment Details
Can I use emollients if I use prescription creams?
Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions if you use prescription creams or products with active ingredients, such as steroid creams. You may need to apply your prescription medications or active products before applying the emollient.
What’s the best way to use emollients?
Emollients absorb better when skin is damp. To get the most out of your emollient:
Take a warm (not hot) bath or shower and use a gentle cleanser.
Rinse your skin well and gently pat dry.
Take a handful of emollient and warm it between your hands.
Apply the emollient to the areas of dry, scaling or irritated skin, ideally within three minutes of getting out of your shower or bath.
Rub the emollient into your skin gently in a downward circular motion.
Can I use emollients instead of soaps?
Soaps and skin cleansers may contain ingredients that can aggravate eczema or dry skin. To combat this, wash your hands with an emollient after washing with soap:
Wash your hands with soap and warm water for 30 seconds.
While your hands are still damp, take a tablespoon of your emollient and rub it all over your hands like soap.
Rinse your hands.
Gently pat your hands dry (don’t rub).
Apply more emollient if needed.
This approach helps remove germs from the skin while minimizing the drying effects of soap. Whenever possible, wash your hands with fragrance-free, hypoallergenic soap and use hand sanitizers that contain moisturizers.
Can I use emollients more than once per day?
You can also use emollients throughout the day whenever your skin feels dry. Emollients without active ingredients are usually safe to use as needed. Check the product’s label to see if it contains active ingredients, such as hydrocortisone.
When trying new emollients, don’t use more than one new product at a time unless your healthcare provider recommends it. If you use multiple products and have a skin reaction, it’s harder to determine which product caused the issue.
