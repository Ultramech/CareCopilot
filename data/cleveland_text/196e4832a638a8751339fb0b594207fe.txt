Organs
Your organs are what make you who you are, and they run every body process you need to live. They aren’t just parts inside you, like your liver or lungs. They also include parts on the outside of your body, like your eyes and mouth. But whether or not you can see them or realize they’re hard at work, they’re a key part of every day of your life.

Organs are structures that handle specific jobs so your body can function. They often work in teams called organ systems.
What are organs?
Organs are specialized structures in your body that handle specific jobs. Some of the best-known organs are your heart, brain or liver. But many other structures count as organs, too. That includes some you might not think of, like your skin.

Each of your cells is like an individual worker doing a specific job. Tissues are groups of related cells teamed up in the same place. Organs consist of many tissues that work together cooperatively to accomplish a bigger job.
Organs are part of bigger systems that handle interconnected jobs. And some organs can be part of more than one system. Some examples of organ systems and the organs that are part of them include:
Cardiovascular
. Your
heart
is this system’s main organ. It also includes major vessels like your
arteries
and
veins
, and smaller vessels like your
capillaries
.
Digestive
. This includes your
stomach
and intestines (
small
and
large
). But it also includes structures like your
esophagus
and openings like your
mouth
and
anus (butthole)
.
Endocrine
. This includes your
pancreas
and glands like your
thyroid
and
adrenals
, to name a few.
Immune
. This includes your
spleen
and
bone marrow
(which makes all kinds of blood cells, including immune-related ones).
Musculoskeletal
. This includes your muscles and all the
bones
of your skeleton. It also includes certain types of connective tissue like
ligaments
and
tendons
.
Nervous
. Your
brain
and
spinal cord
are the main organs, plus all the nerves in your body. Your sensory organs like your
eyes
,
ears
and nose are also part of this system.
Reproductive
. This includes the
ovaries
,
vagina
, uterus, penis, prostate and
testicles
.
Respiratory
. This includes your openings like your
nose
and mouth, plus internal organs like your
lungs
.
Urinary
. This includes internal organs like your
kidneys
and
bladder
, plus external genitals like the penis.

Organs can be single structures like your heart. But they can also be a group of the same type of structure. For example, your bones are technically an organ, but so is the bone marrow inside most of your bones.
How many organs are there?
You might get a different answer depending on who you ask. Before 2016, the number of organs was widely recognized as 78. But researchers continue to expand modern medicine’s understanding of how the body works. That’s why, if you ask experts today how many organs you have, the answer can range from 78 to 80.
In particular, two discoveries explained in research papers from
2016
and
2018
now have experts split on the true number. The two organs that are gaining acceptance but still have some controversy behind them are:
The
mesentery
. This layer wraps around and contributes to how your immune and
lymphatic
systems influence your digestive tract. The 2020 printing of
Gray’s Anatomy,
42nd edition recognized the mesentery as a true organ. That brought the total number of organs to 79.
The interstitium
. This is a network of fluid-filled spaces between your cells. There’s strong evidence it spans your entire body, including in and around major organs.
There’s still a lot of ongoing research into how these organs work and what they do. And advances in technology and medical science may lead to further discoveries.
What are vital organs?
Vital organs are organs that you need to survive. Your body can’t function without them. Some key examples of vital organs include your:
Brain
Heart
Kidney
Lungs
Liver
What organs are on one side of the body?
You have several organs that are centered inside your body, while others are clearly to one side.
Some examples of centered organs in your body include your:
Brain
Bladder
Heart (it’s mainly centered but slightly left, except with rare conditions like
dextrocardia
)
Some examples of left-side organs include your:
Pancreas
Stomach
Spleen
Examples of right-side organs include your:
Appendix
Gallbladder
Liver
And you have several paired organs, with one on each side of your body. They include your:
Lungs
Kidneys
Eyes
Ears
Reproductive organs, including external ones like testicles and internal ones like ovaries
What organs can I survive without?
You can survive without several organs. They include your:
Appendix
Gallbladder
Ovaries and/or uterus
Spleen
Testicles
Large sections of your bowels or the entire colon
You can also survive with just one of several paired organs, like your lungs or kidneys.
While you can’t survive without your heart or at least one kidney, there are artificial versions that can do their jobs.
Artificial hearts
can be long-term replacements for damaged or diseased hearts. And
dialysis
can be a long-term substitute (but not a permanent replacement) for your kidneys.

What are accessory organs?
Accessory organs are organs that contribute to a body system, but they might not necessarily be a clear part of it. One example is your gallbladder, which contributes to your digestive system. Breasts are another example. They can contribute to your reproductive system during
breastfeeding
.
But being an accessory organ doesn’t mean that organ isn’t important. Your liver is an accessory organ to your digestive system, but you also can’t live without it.
What is the largest organ in the body?
The largest body organ you have is your skin. It makes up about 15% of your total body weight. But for just your internal organs, the largest is your liver.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Organs aren’t just something you have inside you. There are plenty of parts on the outside of your body, like your eyes and other facial features, that are organs, too. It can be easy to take them for granted, especially when everything’s working as it should. But if you’re sick and you have an organ issue, it can be hard to think about much else. If you have questions about taking care of your organ health, talk to a healthcare provider. They can offer guidance on how to best take care of your organs and your health overall.
