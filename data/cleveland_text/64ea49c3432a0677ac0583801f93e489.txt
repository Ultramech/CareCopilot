Renal Medullary Carcinoma
Renal medullary carcinoma is a rare, aggressive cancer that forms deep inside your kidney. It’s most common in Black males in their teens or twenties who have sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Although there’s no cure, treatments like chemotherapy may help you live longer. Your healthcare provider will explain your options.

What Is Renal Medullary Carcinoma?
Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare, aggressive form of
kidney cancer
. Fewer than
1 out of 100
people worldwide with kidney cancer have this rare type. Most people diagnosed are young Black males with sickle cell trait or
sickle cell disease
.

Currently, there’s no cure for renal medullary carcinoma. It spreads fast, and it’s challenging to treat. Researchers continue to study new cancer treatments that can slow the progression of this cancer.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of renal medullary carcinoma
Renal medullary carcinoma symptoms include:
Blood in your pee (usually the first presenting symptom)
A lump or mass where your kidneys are (your lower back, just below your ribcage)
Pain where the affected kidney is (for most people, it’s the kidney on the right side)
Fever
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss
Renal medullary carcinoma causes
Doctors don’t know what causes renal medullary carcinoma. But they do know that it involves a change (mutation) in the
SMARCB1
gene.
SMARCB1
is a
tumor suppressor gene
. Normally, this gene stops cancerous tumors from forming. When a mutation happens in this gene, the gene stops working, allowing tumors to grow unchecked.
Almost everyone with renal medullary carcinoma has sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. This suggests a connection between the sickle cell conditions and RMC. With sickle cell, you inherit abnormal genes that cause your
red blood cells
to be sickle-shaped instead of round. The abnormal shape can prevent red blood cells from flowing freely through your tissues and supplying them with oxygen.

One theory is that with RMC, the sickle cells get trapped in the renal medulla (inner part of your kidney). This keeps them from delivering oxygen to the area, causing the tissue to die. The tissue death can damage cells and genes, allowing cancer-causing gene mutations.
But more research is needed before scientists know the full relationship between RMC and sickle cell.
Risk factors
The biggest risk factor for developing renal medullary carcinoma is having sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Other factors associated with RMC risk include your:
Age:
RMC is more common in teens and young adults (from ages 11 to 39).
Sex:
Males
are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop RMC.
Race:
Most people diagnosed with RMC (and sickle cell) in the U.S. are Black.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
If your healthcare team thinks you might have RMC, they’ll do imaging tests to check for tumors in your kidney. The most commonly used tests are CT scans and MRIs. They’ll also check for signs of cancer spread. This typically involves getting a full-body CT scan or a PET scan. Most renal medullary carcinomas have already spread by the time they’re diagnosed.
Your care team will do a
biopsy
to check for cancer cells. This involves using a needle to collect a tissue sample from the tumor. A pathologist will examine the tissue in a lab to check for RMC.
Management and Treatment
How is renal medullary carcinoma treated?
RMC treatment usually starts with
chemotherapy
. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Your healthcare provider may also recommend surgery. They may remove the affected kidney (
nephrectomy
) and nearby lymph nodes to slow cancer spread. You may need surgery to relieve symptoms.
Your provider may recommend that you take part in a clinical trial.
Clinical trials
test the safety and effectiveness of new treatments. For example, some clinical trials for renal medullary carcinoma are testing the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatment alongside newer treatments called
targeted therapy
and
immunotherapy
.
Your provider can explain the benefits and risks associated with your treatment options.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for renal medullary carcinoma?
The life expectancy of a person with renal medullary carcinoma used to be fewer than six months. With recent treatment advancements, more people are living longer. The median survival rate for RMC after diagnosis is 12 months. A median is the midway point. This means that about half the people die within the year of their diagnosis. The other half live past a year.
Still, although the prognosis isn’t good, nothing is certain. Ultimately, your healthcare provider is your best resource for explaining what to expect.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
A renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) diagnosis is a difficult one to process. It’s such a rare cancer that doctors still have a lot to learn about the treatments that work best. For now, therapies like chemotherapy and surgery are options. Taking part in a clinical trial that tests new treatments may be an option, too. Ask your healthcare provider about all therapies available to you. They can help you determine the best way forward.
