Listeriosis
Listeriosis is an illness you can get from eating something contaminated with Listeria bacteria. Foods that can contain Listeria include deli meats, hot dogs, and soft cheeses. Common symptoms include fever, headache and diarrhea. Listeria can be dangerous if you’re pregnant or have a weakened immune system. It’s treatable with antibiotics.

.”

Policy
For many people, a
Listeria
infection causes mild symptoms like a fever, headache, diarrhea or vomiting. But if you have a
weakened immune system
or are over 65, you’re at higher risk for life-threatening complications. If you’re pregnant, the infection can pass to the fetus during
pregnancy
or at birth (
vertical transmission
). This can cause pregnancy loss or serious, life-long health issues for your child.
Symptoms and Causes
Listeria infections can be mild or life-threatening. Severe infections can cause neurological issues, like seizures.
Symptoms of
Listeria
infection
Listeriosis symptoms include:
Fever
Chills
Headache
Diarrhea
Nausea
and
vomiting
Muscle
or
joint pain
Fatigue
You might not have all these symptoms. If
Listeria
spreads beyond your
digestive system
(invasive listeriosis), you might have additional, severe symptoms. These include:
Confusion
Loss of balance
Stiff neck
Seizures
How long after
Listeria
exposure do you get sick?
Symptoms of listeriosis can start a few days to two weeks after eating contaminated food. If you’re pregnant, you might have mild or no symptoms but can still pass the infection to the fetus.
Listeria
causes
The bacteria
Listeria
monocytogenes
causes listeriosis. You get it by eating or drinking something contaminated with the bacteria. If you’re pregnant and get a
Listeria
infection, you can transmit it to the fetus during pregnancy or childbirth.
What foods can contain
Listeria
?
Foods that are more likely to be contaminated with
Listeria
include:
Advertisement
Deli meats, cold cuts and hot dogs
Pâté (pureed meat) and meat spreads
Cold-smoked fish, like lox
Soft cheese, like Brie, Camembert and queso fresco
Unpasteurized dairy products
, like milk, cheese and ice cream (pasteurization kills germs)
Unpasteurized fruit juices like apple cider
Raw, unwashed fruits and vegetables (especially melon)
Sprouts
Raw sushi
Is
Listeria
contagious?
No,
Listeria
infections aren’t contagious — they don’t spread to people around you.
Risk factors
You have a higher risk of getting severely ill or dying from listeriosis if you’re:
Pregnant
65 or older
Have a weakened immune system due to illness or
immunosuppressive medications
Complications of listeriosis
Listeria
can spread from your digestive tract to other parts of your body. This can cause serious complications, including:
Inflammation of your heart (
endocarditis
), bones (
osteomyelitis
) or the lining of your abdominal organs (
peritonitis
)
Inflammation in your brain and spinal cord (
encephalitis
) or their lining (
meningitis
)
Miscarriage
,
stillbirth
or
preterm birth
Pneumonia
Sepsis
, a severe reaction to an infection that causes organ damage
Septicemia
, bacteria multiplying in your blood and spreading to other parts of your body
Urinary tract infections
Death
If you’re born with listeriosis or if you get an infection that spreads to your brain or causes sepsis, you could have long-lasting health conditions. These include:
Developmental delays or differences
Blindness
Organ damage
or failure
Paralysis
Seizures
Diagnosis and Tests
How do you know if you have listeriosis?
You won’t know for sure if you have listeriosis unless you get tested. Many people don’t get tested if their symptoms are mild.
A healthcare provider might suspect you have listeriosis based on your symptoms and whether you’ve eaten something that could’ve been contaminated. They can confirm a diagnosis by testing your
blood
, fluid around your brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid), or
amniotic fluid
(if you’re pregnant) for signs of the bacteria.
Other tests might include:
Blood culture
Testing tissue from the
placenta
after birth (if you’re pregnant)
CT scan
or
MRI
of your brain if you have neurological symptoms
Management and Treatment
How is listeriosis treated?
Antibiotics
like
sulfamethoxazole
and
ampicillin
treat listeriosis. Take your full course of medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider, even if you start to feel better. If you don’t take antibiotics as prescribed, the infection can come back.
If you have mild symptoms and aren’t pregnant or at risk for serious complications, you might not need treatment.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Call your healthcare provider if:
You’re pregnant, over 65 or have a weakened immune system and have symptoms of a
Listeria
infection
Something you’ve eaten or drank recently has been recalled due to
Listeria
contamination, especially if you’re pregnant
Your baby has listeriosis symptoms
Your symptoms don’t get better a few days after starting antibiotics

Ask your provider how to take any medications they prescribe and what to do if you miss a dose.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can
Listeria
go away on its own?
Yes, if you have a healthy immune system and aren’t pregnant, you’ll usually feel better in a couple of days without treatment. But if you’re pregnant or have risk factors for serious illness, talk to a healthcare provider right away. About
1 in 6 people
with invasive listeriosis die.
Is there anything I can do to feel better?
You can manage the symptoms of listeriosis by resting and drinking lots of fluids.
Avoid alcohol
and caffeine, as they can make diarrhea worse. Over-the-counter medications might help relieve some symptoms. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider before giving them medications to make sure they’re safe.
Prevention
Can
Listeria
be prevented?
You can reduce your risk of a
Listeria
infection by following food safety guidelines:
Avoid
unpasteurized dairy products
and juices. This includes milk, cheese and ice cream.
Wash your hands and any food surfaces before and after cooking,
Use a scrub brush and clean, running water to clean raw fruits and vegetables.
Cook
hot dogs, egg dishes and seafood to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).
If you’re pregnant, don’t eat refrigerated pâté or meat spreads from the deli or the meat counter at a grocery store. Heat lunch meat until steaming hot.
Clean up any spills in your refrigerator right away, especially meat juices.

Can
Listeria
be killed by cooking?
Yes, heating foods to the proper temperature kills
Listeria
.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
For most people, food poisoning can make you miserable for a day or two. But sometimes, bacteria like
Listeria
can cause serious health issues. If you have a compromised immune system or are pregnant, pay attention to food recalls and talk to your provider about how to protect yourself from contaminated foods.
