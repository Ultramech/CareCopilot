Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are a treatment for Type 2 diabetes. You take them with your first bite of a meal. They work by slowing down how your body breaks carbs into sugar. This prevents blood sugar from rising too quickly after meals. Gas, bloating and diarrhea are common side effects.

What Are Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors (AGIs)?
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are a class of oral medications that treat Type 2 diabetes. They delay how your body breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars. This makes sugar enter your blood more slowly and helps prevent blood sugar spikes after meals.

Acarbose and miglitol are the two FDA-approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. You take these medications at the start of a meal.
How do alpha-glucosidase inhibitors work?
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors work by blocking alpha-glucosidase enzymes in your
small intestine
. These enzymes break down complex carbs into sugar. This slows the sugar down as it enters your bloodstream. You have a slower and steadier rise in blood sugar after meals instead of a sudden spike.
Treatment Details
What drugs are alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?
The two drugs available in the U.S. are acarbose (Precose®) and miglitol (Glyset®). Both come in 25, 50 and 100 milligram (mg) tablets that you swallow at the start of a meal. You can take up to three doses per day.
Your healthcare provider will recommend a dosage based on how your blood sugar responds and whether you have side effects. If you have questions about your dosage or think it’s not working, contact your provider.
What are the benefits of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?
The main benefit is that it can help control blood sugar spikes after meals. It slows down how glucose enters your bloodstream. This can also improve overall blood sugar management.
One of the other benefits is that it works well with many other diabetes medications, like
metformin
, DPP-4 inhibitors and more.
What are the risks and side effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?
The most common side effects are ones that impact your digestive system. These include:

Diarrhea
Excessive gas
Bloating
Stomach cramps
These usually improve once your body gets used to the dose. Some providers recommend avoiding meals high in carbohydrates to reduce the side effects.
There is also a small risk of
low blood sugar
. But this typically only happens when you’re taking alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with insulin or other diabetes medications known to cause low blood sugar.
Monitor your blood sugar
closely while taking this medication. If low blood sugar happens, you must take glucose (dextrose), not table sugar (sucrose).
Who shouldn’t take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?
You shouldn’t take this medication if you have digestive conditions like
inflammatory bowel disease
. People with certain
kidney
or
liver diseases
should also be cautious with AGIs. You should avoid this medication if you’re pregnant.
Be sure to share your medical history with your healthcare provider. This should also include any allergies you have or medications you take. They can work with you to decide if these drugs are safe for you.
What drugs interact with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can interact with certain medications. These include:
Diabetes medications
: Taking insulin and sulfonylureas with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can lower blood sugar too much.
Digestive enzymes
: Drugs and supplements that affect carbohydrate absorption (like digestive enzymes) can weaken the effectiveness of AGIs. Medicines that bind to your gut, like
Pepto-Bismol®
, can also weaken alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.
Digoxin
: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors may slow the absorption of digoxin, which is a drug to treat heart conditions.
Antibiotics
: Antibiotics can also irritate your digestive tract. Taking antibiotics with AGIs can worsen side effects like diarrhea and bloating.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Finding the right treatment for Type 2 diabetes can be difficult. There are so many options, and they all work a little differently. You don’t have to figure it out alone, though. Your provider can help you. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are usually just one part of your overall treatment plan. There can be pros and cons. Talk to your provider about what to expect and how alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can help manage your blood sugar.
