The Mediterranean Diet is a way of eating that emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy
fats
. You focus on overall eating patterns rather than following strict formulas or calculations.

In general, you’ll eat:
Lots of vegetables, fruit, beans, lentils and nuts.
A good amount of whole grains, like whole-wheat bread and
brown rice
.
Plenty of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) as a source of healthy fat.
A good amount of fish, especially fish rich in
omega-3 fatty acids
.
A moderate amount of natural cheese and yogurt.
Little or no red meat, choosing poultry, fish or beans instead of red meat.
Little or no sweets, sugary drinks or butter.
A moderate amount of
wine
with meals (but if you don’t already drink, don’t start).
This is how people ate in certain Mediterranean countries in the mid-20th century. Researchers have linked these eating patterns with a reduced risk of
coronary artery disease
(CAD). Today, healthcare providers recommend this eating plan if you have risk factors for heart disease or to support other aspects of your health.
A
dietitian
can help you modify your approach as needed based on your medical history, underlying conditions, allergies and preferences.
What are the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet?
The mediterranean diet allows you to focus on overall eating patterns rather than following strict formulas or calculations.
The Mediterranean Diet has many benefits, including:
Lowering your risk of
cardiovascular disease
, including a heart attack or stroke.
Supporting a body weight that’s healthy for you.
Supporting healthy blood sugar levels,
blood pressure
and
cholesterol
.
Lowering your risk of
metabolic syndrome
.
Supporting a healthy balance of gut microbiota (bacteria and other microorganisms) in your
digestive system
.
Lowering your risk for certain types of
cancer
.
Slowing the decline of
brain
function as you age.
Helping you live longer.

The Mediterranean Diet has these benefits because it:
Limits saturated fat and trans fat
. You need some saturated fat, but only in small amounts. Eating too much saturated fat can raise your
LDL (bad) cholesterol
. A high LDL raises your risk of plaque buildup in your arteries (
atherosclerosis
). Trans fat has no health benefits. Both of these “unhealthy fats” can
cause inflammation
.
Encourages healthy unsaturated fats, including omega-3 fatty acids
.
Unsaturated fats
promote healthy
cholesterol levels
, support brain health and combat
inflammation
. Plus, a diet high in unsaturated fats and low in saturated fat promotes healthy blood sugar levels.
Limits sodium
. Eating foods high in sodium can
raise your blood pressure
, putting you at a greater risk for a heart attack or stroke.
Limits refined carbohydrates, including sugar.
Foods high in
refined carbs
can cause your blood sugar to spike. Refined carbs also give you excess calories without much nutritional benefit. For example, such foods often have little or no fiber.
Favors foods high in fiber and antioxidants
. These nutrients help reduce inflammation throughout your body.
Fiber
also helps keep waste moving through your large intestine and helps maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Antioxidants protect you against cancer by warding off
free radicals
.
The Mediterranean Diet includes many different nutrients that work together to help your body. There’s no single food or ingredient responsible for the Mediterranean Diet’s benefits. Instead, the diet is healthy for you because of the combination of nutrients it provides.
Think of a choir with many people singing. One voice alone might carry part of the tune, but you need all the voices to come together to achieve the full effect. Similarly, the Mediterranean Diet works by giving you an ideal blend of nutrients that harmonize to support your health.
Mediterranean Diet food list
The Mediterranean Diet encourages you to eat plenty of some foods (like whole grains and vegetables) while limiting others. If you’re planning a grocery store trip, you might wonder which foods to buy. Here are some examples of foods to eat often with the Mediterranean Diet.
From colorful veggies to crunchy seeds, there's a wide range of nutritious foods to choose from when following a Mediterranean Diet.
Mediterranean Diet serving goals and sizes
A fridge and pantry full of nutritious foods are great for starters. But where do you go from there? How much of each food do you need? It’s always best to talk to a dietitian to get advice tailored to your needs
as you get started
. The chart below offers some general guidance on serving goals and serving sizes, according to the type of food.

How do I create a Mediterranean Diet meal plan?
It’s important to consult with a
primary care physician
(PCP) or dietitian before making drastic changes to your diet or trying any new eating plan. They’ll make sure your intended plan is best for you based on your individual needs. They may also share meal plans and
recipes
for you to try at home.

In general, when thinking about meals, you’ll want to collect some go-to options and recipes for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks. The more variety, the better. You don’t want to get stuck in a rut or feel like you’re restricted in which foods you can or should eat. Luckily, there’s plenty of room for changing things up with the Mediterranean Diet. Below are some examples of meals you might enjoy.
Breakfast
Get your day going strong with breakfasts like:
Steel-cut oats with fresh berries and ground
flaxseed
.
Whole-grain toast with nut butter and a nutritious
smoothie
.
Greek yogurt topped with fruit and walnuts.
Egg white omelet with fresh, seasonal veggies.
Lunch
For midday nutrition and a powerful energy boost, consider:
A bulgur salad like
lemon and herb tabbouleh
or
charred broccoli tabbouleh
.
A
whole-grain pasta salad
with plenty of fresh veggies.
Roasted portobello sandwich
and a cup of
hearty veggie soup
.
Toasted quinoa and salmon salad
.
You may want to prepare some lunches the day before so they’re ready to pack or grab from the fridge as needed.
Dinner
Wrap up the day with a hearty, nutrient-packed entree like:
Salmon with mango salsa
.
Cod with lentils
.
Lean,
roasted chicken over cannellini beans
.
Savory chickpea and spinach “
pancakes for dinner
.”
Black bean burger
on a whole-grain bun served with
roasted beets
.
A
heart-healthy pizza
.

For some added nutrients and color, throw together a side salad — like a
sesame cucumber salad
or a
fennel, orange and mint salad
. To keep things simple, try drizzling mixed greens with a nutritious
Mediterranean dressing
.
Snacks
Portion and prepare snacks ahead of time so they’re ready when you need them. Here are some ideas of what to keep at the ready:
A handful of nuts and seeds (low salt or no salt added).
Fresh fruit, ideally local and in-season.
Nonfat Greek yogurt and a small piece of dark chocolate (at least 70% cacao).
Whole-grain crackers with hummus.
Raw veggies with a nonfat Greek yogurt dip.
What foods are not allowed on the Mediterranean Diet?
The Mediterranean Diet doesn’t set hard and fast rules for what you’re allowed or not allowed. Rather, it encourages you to eat more of certain foods and limit others. Here’s what you should try to limit as much as possible:
Any foods with added sugar, like bakery goods, ice cream and even some granola bars.
Any drinks with added sugar, including fruit juices and sodas.
Beer and liquor.
Foods high in sodium or saturated fat.
Refined carbohydrates, like white bread and white rice.

Additional Common Questions
What is the Mediterranean Diet pyramid?
The Mediterranean Diet pyramid is one way to visualize what foods you should eat and how often. Different organizations have created slightly different versions of this pyramid. All Mediterranean Diet pyramids encourage you to eat mostly veggies, fruits, whole grains and extra virgin olive oil while limiting red meat and sweets.
Advertisement
The Mediterranean Diet pyramid is different from the Food Guide Pyramid that the U.S. government created in the 1990s.
How does lifestyle relate to the Mediterranean Diet?
To get the most from your eating plan, try to:
Exercise regularly, ideally with others.
Avoid smoking or using any tobacco products.
Prepare and enjoy meals with family and friends.
Cook more often than you eat out.
Eat locally sourced foods whenever possible.
Can the Mediterranean Diet be vegetarian?
Yes. If you prefer a vegetarian diet, you can easily modify the Mediterranean Diet to exclude meat and fish. In that case, you’d gain your protein solely from plant sources like nuts and beans. Talk to a dietitian to learn more.
Can the Mediterranean Diet be gluten-free?
Yes. You can modify recipes to exclude gluten-based products. Talk to a dietitian for recipe ideas and support in making necessary changes.
Can I use regular olive oil instead of extra virgin olive oil?
Regular olive oil is a good alternative to an oil that’s high in saturated fat (like palm oil). However, to get the most benefits, opt for
extra virgin olive oil
.
A crucial fact to know before starting the Mediterranean Diet is that not all olive oils are the same. The Mediterranean Diet calls for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), specifically. That’s because it has a healthy fat ratio. This means EVOO contains more healthy fat (unsaturated) than unhealthy fat (saturated). Aside from its fat ratio, EVOO is healthy because it’s high in antioxidants.
Antioxidants
help protect your cells from damage, therefore protecting your heart and brain and reducing inflammation throughout your body. Because it’s manufactured differently, regular olive oil doesn’t contain as many of these antioxidants.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
In a world with endless diet options, it can be hard to know which one is right for you. Research has proven the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet for many people, especially those at risk for heart disease. Beyond protecting your heart, the Mediterranean Diet can help you prevent or manage many other conditions.
As with any eating plan, it’s important to talk to a healthcare provider before getting started. They’ll make sure the plan is appropriate for you and help you modify it as needed. Also, tell your loved ones about your goals. Invite them to cook and share meals with you. It’s easier to follow an eating plan over the long term when you have a supportive community with you along the way.
