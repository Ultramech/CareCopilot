What is the difference between a pimple and scalp acne?
While acne causes pimples on your skin, there are differences between acne and pimples.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is scalp acne diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose scalp acne after a physical exam to look at your symptoms. They may ask questions to learn more about your medical history and risk factors like whether or not acne runs in your family history, your stress level and if you’re menstruating. They might also ask questions about the skin care products you use.
If you have a sudden eruption of scalp acne, your healthcare provider might offer additional blood tests to rule out conditions that could cause your acne.
Management and Treatment
How do I get rid of scalp acne?
Treatment for scalp acne varies based on what causes your hair follicles to clog.
You can treat pimples on your scalp at home if your symptoms are mild by:
Not using hair care products that contain oil, leave a residue in your hair or are greasy.
Washing your hair more often, especially after you sweat.
Not wearing headbands or tight-fitting hats. Choose helmets with ventilation that are properly fitted to your head.
If you have persistent, moderate or severe scalp acne, treatment could include taking or using:
Topical or oral
antibiotics
to clear bacteria from your hair follicles.
Topical steroids to treat folliculitis.
Oral
isotretinoin
to treat long-term scalp acne.
Oral
antihistamines
to reduce symptoms of itchiness.
You can rub topical medications on your skin in the same way you’d rub lotion on your skin. You can take oral medications by mouth according to your provider’s instructions. Talk to your healthcare provider about the side effects of each medication before starting it. Also, tell your provider about the supplements and medications you currently take to avoid drug interactions.

Can I pop pimples on my scalp?
You shouldn’t pop pimples on your scalp. It can be tempting to pop pimples on your body, but popping pimples can make your symptoms worse by causing more pimples, scarring or infection. Instead, use good hygiene and oil-free shampoos, along with the treatment prescribed by your healthcare provider to make your pimples go away.
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
After you and your healthcare provider determine what caused scalp acne and you begin treatment, it could take up to six weeks before all of your pimples clear up. You could see improvement in your scalp a few days after you begin treatment or stop using hair care products that cause acne, like less itchiness and the lack of new pimples forming on your skin. If you don’t see your acne clear up after six weeks, contact your healthcare provider.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have scalp acne?
Pimples on your scalp can be a temporary irritation or a long-term condition depending on the cause. Your healthcare provider will help you determine the cause and treatment to help your scalp acne go away. Though sometimes difficult, try not to scratch the pimples on your scalp. This can cause them to erupt, leak fluid or bleed. This can result in pain, and scarring and could lead to an infection. After treatment begins, it can take up to six weeks for your skin to clear up.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Pimples on your scalp can be a challenge to your skin care routine. Determining the cause of your scalp acne involves a lot of trial and error to see if the products you’re using are clogging your pores or if there’s an underlying cause of your symptoms. If you have mild acne, it could help to keep a daily skin care log to track the products you use and how your skin reacts to them, then avoid using products that cause pimples to form on your skin. Your healthcare provider will help you manage your scalp acne so you can feel more confident and comfortable.
