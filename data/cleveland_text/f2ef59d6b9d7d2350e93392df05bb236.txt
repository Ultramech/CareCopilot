It can lead to symptoms like:
Delusions
: Strong beliefs that aren’t based in reality
Hallucinations
: Seeing, hearing or sensing things that aren’t there
Psychosis
: Disorganized thinking and behavior make it hard to stay grounded
These symptoms can have a major impact on your daily life and relationships.
This condition affects an
estimated
1 in 300 people worldwide.
While it’s a lifelong disorder, treatment can help you manage symptoms so you can feel better.
Symptoms and Causes
There are five common symptoms of schizophrenia. These may increase your risk of complications.
Symptoms of schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia often don’t know they have symptoms. But others, like friends and family, may notice them.
Symptoms may include:
Delusions
: Believing things that aren’t true, even with clear evidence (like thinking someone’s controlling your actions)
Hallucinations
: Sensing things that aren’t really there (like hearing voices, seeing people or feeling something touch you when nothing’s present)
Disorganized speech
: Trouble organizing your thoughts while speaking, making it hard to stay on topic or be understood
Disorganized or
catatonic behavior
: Moving or acting in ways others might not expect (like laughing excessively, making repetitive motions or staying very still)
Negative symptoms
: Reduced ability to function (like showing little emotion, speaking in a flat tone or losing motivation to socialize or enjoy activities)

Schizophrenia causes
The cause of schizophrenia isn’t known. Experts believe it may happen for different reasons, like:
Chemical imbalances of
neurotransmitters
(
dopamine
and
glutamate
), used for cell-to-cell communication in your
brain
Brain development problems before birth
Loss of connection between different areas of your brain
Risk factors of schizophrenia
Your risk may increase due to the following:
Genetics
: A biological parent or sibling also has the condition
Environmental factors
: Exposure to
viruses
or
malnutrition
before birth
Substance use
: Using certain substances during your teen and young adult years, especially at a younger age or with more frequent use
Complications of schizophrenia
Complications of schizophrenia may include:
Feeling suspicious,
paranoid
or scared
Not caring about your hygiene and appearance
Experiencing
depression
and
anxiety
Using
addictive substances
to try to ease symptoms
Your risk of
suicidal thoughts
and
suicide
also increases with schizophrenia. If you ever need help or someone to talk to, call or text
988
(U.S.). This is the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Someone can speak with you 24/7. If you need immediate medical attention, call 911 or your local emergency services number.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose schizophrenia
A healthcare provider can diagnose schizophrenia by learning more about your symptoms. To do this, they’ll observe your behavior or ask you questions about what you’re experiencing. They’ll compare those with the criteria in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(
DSM-5
). They’ll also take a complete medical history.
A diagnosis usually happens during the late teen years or early adulthood.
Males
typically notice symptoms sooner (early 20s) than females (mid 20s to early 30s).
Schizophrenia in children
is rare but possible.
Schizophrenia test
There aren’t any diagnostic tests for schizophrenia. But healthcare providers may run tests to rule out other conditions before diagnosing schizophrenia, like:
Imaging tests
:
CT
or
MRI
scans to check for
stroke
,
brain injury
,
tumors
or structural changes
Lab tests
:
Blood
,
urine
or
cerebrospinal fluid tests
to rule out infections, poisoning or chemical imbalances
Brain activity tests
: An
EEG
to check for disorders like
epilepsy
Management and Treatment
How is schizophrenia treated?
Treatment for schizophrenia may include:
Medications
: There are different types of medications available, usually
antipsychotics
, to help manage symptoms.
Psychotherapy
: Talk therapy, like
cognitive behavioral therapy
for psychosis (CBTp), may help you better understand how your thoughts influence your behaviors. It could help you reduce
stress
and learn healthy coping skills that may improve daily functioning and prevent complications.
Rehabilitation
: Supportive services like
resilience training
, family therapy, cognitive support, and help with work or school are available. They can improve coping skills, communication, thinking abilities and long-term success.

If medications don’t improve your symptoms, your provider may recommend other options. One is
electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT). ECT is a safe treatment that sends small electric signals to your brain. It causes a short
seizure
to help your brain work differently.
Schizophrenia medication
Antipsychotic medications are a key part of treating schizophrenia. These may include:
Aripiprazole
(Abilify®, Aristada®)
Brexpiprazole
(Rexulti®)
Cariprazine
(Vraylar®)
Clozapine
(Clozaril®)
Haloperidol
(Haldol®)
Lurasidone
(Latuda®)
Lumateperone
(Caplyta®)
Olanzapine
(Zyprexa®, Lybalvi®, Symbyax®)
Quetiapine
(Seroquel®)
Risperidone
(Risperdal®, Perseris®, Risperdal Consta®)
Xanomeline and trospium (Cobenfy™)
There are two main types of antipsychotics: first and second generation. First generation (typical) blocks dopamine receptors. Second generation (atypical) targets dopamine and serotonin receptors. These medications adjust the balance of these brain chemicals (neurotransmitters). An imbalance of chemicals may cause symptoms like delusions and hallucinations.
Emerging treatments are expanding. One example is a newly approved combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride (Cobenfy). This works through the cholinergic system. This system helps control things like memory, thinking and muscle movement. It doesn’t mainly target dopamine receptors the way traditional antipsychotics do. It marks the first in a new class of antipsychotic drugs.

Talk to your provider about what possible side effects to look out for if you start a new medication.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have schizophrenia, you’ll need to schedule regular visits with your healthcare provider. Follow up with them as recommended and anytime you notice changes in your symptoms. Let them know if you have any medication side effects, especially ones that are disruptive to your daily routine. They may be able to adjust your treatment or recommend other options that work better for you.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have schizophrenia?
This mental health disorder varies greatly from person to person. While schizophrenia can affect many parts of daily life, treatment may help you manage symptoms more effectively.
Symptoms often come in cycles. These are periods when they flare up and times when they improve, but don’t fully go away completely. It’s important to continue treatment as directed, even when you’re feeling better, to prevent setbacks and maintain progress.
Some people respond well to treatment but may still face ongoing challenges, like difficulty thinking clearly or staying focused. This is common. Your care team can work with you to adjust your treatment as needed.
Schizophrenia isn’t deadly on its own. But without treatment, it can lead to serious problems, like a higher chance of suicide. That’s why ongoing care, support and open communication with your providers are essential.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Schizophrenia can feel overwhelming, both for you and those who care about you. But it’s important to know that with the right care, many people find stability.
If you’re concerned about changes in your or a loved one’s thoughts, feelings or behavior, consider talking to a healthcare provider. Mental health professionals have the training to listen, support and guide people through this condition without judgment. Getting help can make a lasting difference.
Living with schizophrenia isn’t easy, but treatment can help you take back control and move forward.
