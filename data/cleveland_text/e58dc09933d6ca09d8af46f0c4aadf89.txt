Overview
Nonsurgical rhinoplasty uses dermal fillers to change the shape of your nose.
What is nonsurgical rhinoplasty?
Nonsurgical rhinoplasty is a cosmetic procedure that temporarily changes the shape of your
nose
using dermal fillers. This treatment is sometimes called a liquid nose job or nonsurgical nose job.

Can nonsurgical rhinoplasty do what surgery does?
Compared to traditional
rhinoplasty
, a nonsurgical nose job has limitations. For example, with nonsurgical rhinoplasty, your nose can’t be made smaller and results only last up to six months. But dermal fillers can temporarily smooth bumps and modify certain characteristics.
Nonsurgical rhinoplasty may be right for you if you want to:
Add volume to your nose.
Enhance the tip of your nose.
Smooth out lumps or bumps.
Camouflage a bump on the bridge of your nose.
Straighten a slightly crooked nose.
Nonsurgical nose jobs are an excellent way to make minor changes to your nose or find out how certain modifications to your nose may look. However, if you’re looking for dramatic, long-lasting changes, you may be better suited for traditional rhinoplasty.
Does nonsurgical rhinoplasty make your nose bigger?
A nonsurgical nose job can add volume to your nose, but it can’t make it smaller. Many people worry that dermal fillers will make their nose look abnormally large. But when it’s done correctly, nonsurgical rhinoplasty can make your nose look more balanced and proportionate with the rest of your facial features.
Can a nonsurgical nose job narrow your nose?
No. As mentioned, nonsurgical rhinoplasty can’t make your nose smaller or narrower. But in many cases, it can smooth out bumps and make your nose appear more symmetrical.

Treatment Details
What happens before nonsurgical rhinoplasty?
Your healthcare provider will meet with you to discuss your cosmetic goals. They’ll ask you what you’d like to change or improve about your nose. They may also take photographs of your nose to help with your treatment plan.
Some people aren’t candidates for nonsurgical rhinoplasty. But your healthcare provider can talk with you to find a treatment option that’s right for you.
How does nonsurgical rhinoplasty work?
With nonsurgical rhinoplasty,
dermal fillers
are used to reshape your nose. Dermal fillers contain a gel-like ingredient — usually,
hyaluronic acid
— that adds volume when injected just beneath your skin.
When artistically performed by a licensed and experienced healthcare provider, nonsurgical rhinoplasty yields impressive results that last up to six months.
What happens during nonsurgical rhinoplasty?
During nonsurgical rhinoplasty, your healthcare provider may apply a topical anesthetic to numb your skin. Next, they’ll inject the dermal filler into specific areas on your nose to achieve the desired results. In some cases, your healthcare provider might use
botulinum toxin injections
instead. You might feel slight pressure or pinching during this process.
The entire procedure usually takes 45 minutes or fewer.
What happens after nonsurgical rhinoplasty?
Following nonsurgical rhinoplasty, most people experience minor side effects, such as redness and sensitivity in the treatment area. These symptoms usually only last a day or two.
Additional side effects may include:
Swelling.
Bruising
.
Nausea
.
Migration (when the filler material migrates to other areas).

Risks / Benefits
What are the advantages of nonsurgical rhinoplasty?
The most notable benefit of nonsurgical rhinoplasty is that many people can achieve desired results without plastic surgery. There are other advantages, too. For example:
The treatment takes less than one hour.
No downtime is necessary.
Results are immediate.
Changes are reversible.
There aren’t any incisions or scarring.
Are nonsurgical nose jobs safe?
Any procedure carries risks. But because your nose is vascular (filled with blood vessels) and close to your eyes, nonsurgical rhinoplasty is more technical and complicated than other dermal filler procedures.
A nonsurgical nose job should be performed by a licensed professional, such as a
plastic surgeon
, to avoid potential complications such as:
Fever
.
Blurred vision.
Increasing redness or swelling.
Vascular complications.
Tissue necrosis (death).
Vision loss
.
Recovery and Outlook
How long does recovery take?
No downtime is necessary after nonsurgical rhinoplasty. You should be able to resume normal activities right away.
Your healthcare provider will give you specific instructions for managing any side effects.
How long does a nonsurgical nose job last?
In most cases, nonsurgical nose jobs last about six months. Depending on the type of dermal filler used, results could last a bit longer.

Is a nonsurgical nose job worth it?
It depends on your cosmetic goals. If you’re wanting a subtle change in your appearance — and you don’t need to improve the function of your nose — then a nonsurgical nose job may be right for you.
However, if you want to make your nose smaller — or if you want to make major changes to your nose’s structure — you may be better suited for traditional rhinoplasty.
When To Call the Doctor
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you’ve recently had a nonsurgical nose job, call your healthcare provider right away if you develop:
Blurred vision.
Fever.
An allergic reaction, such as
hives
.
Redness or swelling that worsens after three days.
