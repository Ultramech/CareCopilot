Your knee joints function with the help of several branches of the following nerves:
Femoral nerve
.
Common
peroneal nerve
.
Saphenous nerve
.
Tibial nerve
.
Obturator nerve
.
These branches around your knee joint are known as genicular nerves. “Genicular” means “relating to the knee.” Genicular nerves provide sensory innervation to your knee and include the:
Superolateral genicular nerve (SLGN).
Superomedial genicular nerve (SMGN).
Inferomedial genicular nerve (IMGN).
Inferolateral genicular nerve (ILGN).
Healthcare providers can safely target all of these nerves for a genicular nerve block except for the ILGN. This is because the ILGN is too close to your peroneal nerve.
What is a genicular nerve block used for?
A genicular nerve block has two main purposes:
To alleviate chronic
knee pain
: If you have chronic knee pain that hasn’t responded to conservative treatments, like
physical therapy
,
NSAIDs
or steroid knee joint injections, your healthcare provider may recommend a genicular nerve block. It may provide pain relief. Chronic knee pain can have several possible causes, such as injury and
knee osteoarthritis
.
To alleviate moderate to severe postoperative knee pain
: If you’re having a knee surgery, such as a total knee
arthroplasty
(knee replacement), your
anesthesiologist
or surgeon may give you a genicular nerve block before the surgery to manage pain after the surgery. They use this in addition to general
anesthesia
and other peripheral nerve blocks.

Treatment Details
How should I prepare for a genicular nerve block?
You usually don’t have to do anything special to prepare for a genicular nerve block.
In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend sedation for the procedure. If you’re receiving sedation, you’ll need to fast for six to eight hours before it. You’ll also need someone else to drive you home after the procedure.
In any case, your healthcare provider will let you know what to do. Be sure to follow their instructions. Don’t hesitate to ask questions.
What happens during a genicular nerve block?
Healthcare providers typically perform genicular nerve blocks for pain management in an outpatient setting. This means you’re not admitted to a hospital for the procedure and can go home shortly after it.
In general, you can expect the following when you receive a genicular nerve block:
You’ll lie on your back on a procedure table. A provider will put a small pillow under your affected knee to prop it up slightly.
You may receive a mild sedative through an IV line in your arm to help you relax.
The provider will clean the skin on your knee with an antiseptic solution. They’ll give you an injection of a local anesthetic to numb the area where you’ll receive the nerve block. You may still feel a pinch or some discomfort as the needle enters your skin.
The provider may use imaging guidance, such as
ultrasound
or
fluoroscopy
, to locate the exact spot where the injection needs to go. They’ll then inject the medication as close to the affected nerve(s) as possible.
After the procedure, you’ll rest until the medication takes effect.
The procedure takes about five to 10 minutes to complete.
What happens after a genicular nerve block?
After the injection, you’ll rest for 15 to 30 minutes to let the medication take effect. A nurse will also observe you during this time to make sure you don’t have any unexpected side effects. You’ll then be able to go home.

Risks / Benefits
What are the benefits of a genicular nerve block?
Potential benefits of a genicular nerve block include:
Temporary or permanent pain relief, which may help you function better day to day.
Temporary or permanent reduction of inflammation in the affected nerves, which may help them heal.
Temporary pain relief after knee surgery.
A pain relief option for people who can’t undergo knee surgery due to health issues.
Some people may feel relief in a few hours, or it may take a couple of weeks for the steroid to take effect. It’s important to note that not everyone experiences pain relief from nerve blocks. You may need to try other treatment options if this is the case.
If you experience effective pain relief following a genicular nerve block, your healthcare provider may recommend genicular nerve ablation (GNA) to treat your knee pain. GNAs typically provide pain relief for about 18 months.
What are the risks or possible complications of a genicular nerve block?
You may have some soreness and slight bruising at the site of the injection, but this is usually mild and should go away within a couple of days.
