Glossitis
Glossitis is inflammation that makes your tongue swollen, smooth or red. Allergic reactions, infections and dry mouth may cause it. Treatment — including antibiotics, changing what you eat and practicing better oral hygiene — often makes glossitis go away.

What Is Glossitis?
Glossitis is inflammation of your tongue. The disease can make your tongue hurt, swell and turn red. The swelling may make it hard for you to breathe, eat or talk.

The disease gets its name from the way it affects your tongue. It may look smooth or glossy (shiny) if glossitis affects your papillae (tiny bumps on your tongue). Many issues can cause this disease, including allergies, infections, injuries or poor
nutrition
.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of glossitis
Symptoms may appear suddenly or develop over a long time. Your specific symptoms will depend on the cause. Your tongue may:
Look smooth and glossy (shiny)
Be sore, tender or painful
Swell and look reddish in color
Rarely, severe swelling can make it hard for you to chew, swallow, talk or breathe.
Glossitis causes
Many things may cause glossitis. Some common causes include:
Allergic reactions to foods, medicine or dental care products
Dry mouth
Eating spicy food
Hormonal changes
Infections (viral, bacterial or fungal)
Mouth injury
Nutritional deficiencies
Using alcohol or tobacco
Wearing dentures or other oral appliances
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
A healthcare provider will look at your tongue and mouth. They’ll check for the missing papillae. They may do other tests to rule out conditions that can affect your tongue.
Management and Treatment
How is glossitis treated?
Your treatment will depend on the cause, but some common treatments include:
Medication
:
Your provider may prescribe antibiotics, antivirals or antifungal medication to treat an underlying infection. They may give you a corticosteroid ointment to ease inflammation that makes your tongue hurt and turn red.
Dietary changes
: Poor nutrition can cause glossitis. Your provider may prescribe supplements if tests show you’re not getting the right amount of vitamins from the food you eat. They may also recommend ways you can add essential nutrients to your meals.
Oral hygiene
: Bacteria on your tongue can cause infections. Practicing good
oral hygiene
, including brushing your tongue, reduces that risk.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your healthcare provider to see if glossitis symptoms last longer than 10 days or if your symptoms don’t respond to treatment. Call 911 (or your local emergency service number) or go to the emergency room if your tongue swells so much that it affects your breathing or you have issues talking.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have glossitis?
Glossitis often goes away after treatment. But it can come back. In that case, your healthcare provider will recommend ways to manage your symptoms.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Unless you bite your tongue, you may not pay much attention to it. That can change if you develop glossitis. This condition can turn your tongue’s surface from bumpy to smooth and glossy. Glossitis is painful and makes your tongue swell. Pain and swelling that lasts for more than 10 days are reasons to talk to a healthcare provider. Many things can cause glossitis, like infections or not getting enough nutrition. Your provider will find the cause and treat your symptoms and any underlying conditions.
