Aseptic Technique
Aseptic technique is a procedure that healthcare providers use to prevent the spread of germs that cause infection. Placing barriers, using sterile equipment and following strict guidelines help create an environment free of germs that can make you sick.

Overview
What is aseptic technique?
Aseptic techniques are strict procedures that healthcare providers use to prevent the spread of infection. These procedures involve following rigorous guidelines to ensure the environment remains free of pathogens (germs that can make you sick).

Policy
Many different types of providers use aseptic techniques, from
primary care physicians
(PCPs) to surgeons.
Pathologists
also use aseptic techniques in their laboratories to prevent contamination.
Why would someone need aseptic technique?
Most healthcare providers agree on this aseptic technique definition: A set of procedural guidelines to eliminate pathogens and reduce your risk of infection.
Healthcare providers use aseptic techniques any time they need to prevent the spread of harmful pathogens (
bacteria
,
viruses
, funguses,
parasites
). They commonly follow these procedures when they’re:
Dressing wounds.
Inserting
PICC lines
or other types of
central venous catheters
.
Giving
dialysis
.
Doing surgery.
What are the differences between aseptic, sterile and clean techniques?
Germs
are everywhere. They’re in the air we breathe, the water we drink and in the soil in which we grow our food. They’re on plants and animals. They’re on us.
That might be a scary thought. But not all germs are bad. In fact, most of them don’t harm us at all. But when we must undergo a medical procedure, it’s important to reduce or eliminate pathogens. Pathogens are the germs that cause
infectious diseases
. Examples include parasites and bacteria, viruses and funguses. Aseptic techniques focus on eliminating pathogens.

To learn more about aseptic techniques, it’s helpful to know these terms and what they mean:
Clean
. This refers to completely clean items that aren’t sterile. Boxed gloves (like the ones you see in your physician’s office) are great examples of clean protective gear. An unused glove from a box is free from dirt, stains and other debris. But it’s not sterile. That means it still has some microorganisms, like most things in our everyday environment. In a nutshell, clean techniques focus on reducing the overall number of germs. But they don’t completely eliminate them.
Aseptic
. This refers to a stricter standard of infection control. While clean techniques reduce overall germs, aseptic techniques aim to eliminate them. One aseptic technique example is in the operating room. Providers wear sterile gloves rather than clean gloves. They also wear sterile gowns and use sterile drapes and instruments. They place barriers over everything.
Sterile
. The terms “sterile” and “aseptic” generally refer to the same idea — eliminating germs to prevent infection. Healthcare providers usually use “aseptic” to describe techniques and procedures and “sterile” to describe settings and instruments. (Example: Your provider uses “aseptic” techniques to create a “sterile” environment.)
Treatment Details
What are the four elements of aseptic techniques?
Aseptic techniques require strict guidelines that help prevent germs that cause infection. Providers categorize these guidelines into four elements:
Tool and patient preparation
. Healthcare providers must have sterilized any tools or instruments they’ll use during aseptic techniques. The most common method is steam sterilization. A provider wraps the instruments and places them in an autoclave. An autoclave is a machine that exposes the instruments to heat and steam pressure. When the provider takes the instruments out of the autoclave, they check a sterilization indicator (like temperature-sensitive tape or a color-changing dot) to make sure the instruments are sterile. In addition to sterilizing tools and instruments, a provider will also apply antiseptic to your skin to reduce germs.
Barriers
. Barriers include any items that prevent cross contamination. For example, when your provider wears masks, gowns and gloves, it keeps germs on them from getting onto you.
Contact guidelines
. During aseptic techniques, providers follow strict sterile-to-sterile contact guidelines. This means they wear sterile protective gear and only touch sterile items.
Environmental controls
. This refers to anything that helps reduce germs getting into the treatment room. One example is keeping doors closed during surgical procedures.

Why is aseptic technique important?
Your
skin
is your body’s barrier against germs. Any time you cut your skin, you’re more vulnerable to infection. A cut made during surgery is still a type of wound, even though you’re in a controlled environment. Aseptic techniques help protect you from germs that cause infection so your body can heal and recover rather than fight off infections.
Aseptic techniques are important in situations where healthcare providers need to eliminate germs completely — and they’re particularly valuable for people who already have compromised
immune systems
. Without aseptic guidelines, you’d have a much higher risk of developing infection after surgeries or even minor medical procedures.
In many cases, clean techniques are sufficient for preventing the spread of harmful pathogens. But the aseptic technique is essential when you need an added layer of caution and protection.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
For aseptic techniques to work, every healthcare provider must follow the appropriate guidelines. Don’t be afraid to speak up if you notice a provider doesn’t wash their hands or use properly sterilized instruments. It’s OK to ask your provider about the infection control techniques they use. They can give you more information and tell you what to expect.

We come into contact with germs every day. Most don’t harm us. But some of them carry or cause diseases. Anytime you have surgery, you’re at risk for infection. Aseptic techniques help eliminate germs and improve your chances of a successful recovery.
