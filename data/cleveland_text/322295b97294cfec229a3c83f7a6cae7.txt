Schistosomiasis
Schistosomiasis is an infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma. You get it from contact with freshwater sources that have the parasite in them. This includes swimming in or drinking the contaminated water, or using it for laundry. It’s mostly found in parts of Africa. It can lead to organ damage if left untreated.

What Is Schistosomiasis?
Schistosomiasis causes flu-like symptoms at first. It can spread to other parts of your body and cause permanent damage.
Schistosomiasis is an infection with the
parasitic
worm
Schistosoma
. The worm enters your body through your skin and can spread through your blood to other parts of your body. If you don’t treat the infection, it can damage your organs. You get it from contact with freshwater — like rivers, lakes and creeks — that contain the snails that carry it. Schistosomiasis is also called bilharzia.

Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of schistosomiasis
It takes a while for symptoms of schistosomiasis to show up. The only symptom you might notice right away is itching or a rash where the worm entered your skin. You might have
flu-like symptoms
a few weeks or months after getting infected. These include:
Fever
Chills
Muscle aches
Cough
Stomach pain
These symptoms often go away on their own. If the worms spread to your organs, you might develop additional symptoms months later. These include:
Digestive symptoms (loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting blood, black stool)
Urinary symptoms (difficulty peeing, blood in your pee, leaking pee)
Painful intercourse
Abnormal
vaginal discharge
Painful or
bloody ejaculation
Lower back pain
Shortness of breath
Rarely, some people develop neurological symptoms. These include seizures, severe headaches, vision problems and difficulty walking.
Schistosomiasis causes
Schistosoma
, a type of parasitic worm, causes schistosomiasis. There are many species of
Schistosoma
that can infect humans. When someone with a
Schistosoma
infection poops or pees in water, the parasite eggs are released.
The eggs hatch, and the larvae infect freshwater snails to reproduce. Then, they’re released from the snails into the water. From there, they enter your body through your skin.

You can get infected when you’re exposed to contaminated water, like:
Swimming or bathing in it
Drinking it
Washing your clothes in it
Fishing in it
People without access to clean, running water and toilet facilities are at the highest risk.
Is schistosomiasis contagious?
No, it’s not contagious. The
Schistosoma
larvae need snails to continue their life cycle. They can’t spread from person to person.
Where is
Schistosoma
found?
The parasites that cause schistosomiasis are found in many areas of the world, including parts of:
Africa
Asia
France (Corsica)
South America
The Caribbean
The Middle East
Complications
If left untreated, schistosomiasis can spread from your blood to other parts of your body, causing:
Enlarged liver and spleen
Intestinal infection
Infection and scarring of your bladder and urinary tract
Scarring and
granulomas
in your genitals
Changes in how your brain and spinal cord work (
encephalopathy
)
Repeated infections can cause
anemia
, malnutrition and developmental issues. Scarring and inflammation of your bladder can eventually lead to
bladder cancer
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose schistosomiasis
Healthcare providers diagnose schistosomiasis by looking for parasite eggs in your pee or poop. They might also do blood tests. Make sure you let your provider know if you’ve traveled anywhere or think you could’ve been exposed to
Schistosoma.
It takes a few weeks after exposure to
Schistosoma
to test positive for infection.
Management and Treatment
Can schistosomiasis be cured completely?
Yes, schistosomiasis can completely go away with treatment. Healthcare providers treat it with the antibiotic
praziquantel
. You take two to three doses for a day or two. You may have to take additional doses a few weeks after the first treatment to get rid of it entirely.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to a healthcare provider if you’ve been exposed to water that could have
Schistosoma
in it, especially if you develop flu-like symptoms weeks later. They can test you for an infection a few weeks after exposure. Early treatment can kill the infection before it spreads.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have schistosomiasis?
Schistosomiasis is treatable. But it’s best to catch and treat it early, before it spreads. Even with treatment, organ damage can be permanent.
What is the life expectancy of someone with schistosomiasis?
One recent study
suggests that the life expectancy of someone with advanced schistosomiasis is around 50 years. The study was done in an area where schistosomiasis is common.
Prevention
Can schistosomiasis be prevented?
You can reduce your risk of schistosomiasis by:
Not swimming in freshwater in areas where
Schistosoma
live
Boiling bath water (and letting it cool) if it comes from a source where
Schistosoma
live
Toweling off right away after swimming and bathing
Drinking bottled water if you’re unsure whether the water where you are is safe
Access to clean water and antiparasitic medications can help prevent schistosomiasis in areas where it commonly spreads.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Many people love a refreshing dip in a river or lake. Unfortunately,
Schistosoma
parasites like to spend time there, too. But schistosomiasis is curable and shouldn’t spread to other parts of your body if caught early. Talk to your provider if you’ve been in an area where you could’ve been exposed.
