Treatment Details
What are examples of cosmetic dentistry?
Cosmetic dentistry aims to create a more balanced, symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing smile. Common cosmetic dental services include both nonsurgical and surgical treatments like:
Teeth whitening
. Professional teeth whitening can dramatically and safely lighten the shade of your teeth.
Dental bonding
. Dental bonding can change the shape of a tooth to make it longer, wider or more uniform. It can conceal cracks, craze lines (hairline cracks), discoloration and other cosmetic imperfections.
Veneers
. Made of medical-grade ceramic, porcelain veneers are thin, strong shells that adhere to the front surfaces of your teeth. Like dental bonding, veneers can conceal a wide range of cosmetic flaws, including chips, cracks and discoloration.
Tooth contouring
. This procedure removes small amounts of tooth enamel to change the shape of your teeth. Because you only have so much natural enamel, there’s a limit to how much your dentist can remove.
Gum contouring
. Excess gum tissue can make your smile appear “gummy” or uneven. During gum contouring surgery, your dentist removes excess gum tissue and reshapes your gum line for a more symmetrical, balanced appearance.

What are the disadvantages of cosmetic dentistry?
Insurance usually doesn’t cover cosmetic dentistry services. This is because insurance companies don’t consider cosmetic procedures necessary from a health standpoint.
You’ll also need a certain level of commitment to maintain your smile. Some treatments — like porcelain veneers — may be irreversible and require replacement every few years.
Recovery and Outlook
How long will it take for me to feel better?
It depends on the type of cosmetic procedure and the number of teeth that need treatment. For example, someone who has dental bonding on one tooth can resume normal activities immediately. But someone who has gum contouring may need to take a couple of days off work to recover. Your dentist can tell you what kind of timeline to expect.
How long does cosmetic dentistry last?
Results can last anywhere from a few months to the rest of your life. It depends on the type of procedure you have and how well you take care of your teeth and gums:

When To Call the Doctor
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Talk to your dentist any time you’re concerned about the appearance of your smile. They can discuss cosmetic dental options with you.
In the meantime, you should continue seeing your general dentist for routine care, like checkups and cleanings. And don’t forget to practice good
oral hygiene
at home between visits to keep your teeth and gums healthy.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Wanting to improve your smile doesn’t make you vain. It’s hard to feel confident when there’s something you don’t like about your appearance. You might even avoid certain social situations because of it. There are many cosmetic dentistry treatments available, ranging from simple to complex. Talk to your dentist about your specific cosmetic goals. They can design a treatment plan that works for your budget and lifestyle.
