Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a group of rare blood cancers that affect your skin. Most cutaneous T-cell lymphomas grow very slowly and aren’t life-threatening. Rarely, people with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas develop serious forms of the condition. Healthcare providers have treatments to ease symptoms, but they can’t cure the lymphomas.

Overview
In 10% of cases, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may affect your lymph nodes (top), spleen, large intestine, small intestine (middle) and inguinal lymph nodes (bottom).
What is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)?
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a group of rare
blood cancers
that affects the largest organ in your body — your
skin
. CTCLs can look and feel like common skin conditions like
psoriasis
,
eczema
or even allergic reactions. Many people have symptoms like
skin rash
,
itchiness
or discoloration for years before obtaining a diagnosis.

CTCLs are part of a larger group of
cancers
called
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
, which start in certain
white blood cells
called
lymphocytes
.
Many people treated for CTCL go into
remission
, returning to their daily routines without much disruption. Still, a cancer diagnosis can take a toll on your mental and emotional health. Your healthcare team is here to help.
Types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
There are many types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. But the most common are mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome:
Mycosis fungoides
: This slow-growing cancer accounts for about half of all CTCL cases. It happens when
T cells
(T lymphocytes) become cancerous. The cancerous cells usually don’t spread beyond your skin. But a few might find their way to your lymph nodes and bloodstream. When cancerous T-cells circulate in your
blood
, providers call them Sézary cells.
Sézary syndrome
: With this fast-growing CTCL, you have large numbers of Sézary cells in your skin and your bloodstream. Mycosis fungoides can turn into Sézary syndrome. People with this condition often have widespread skin discoloration.
How common is the condition?
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are rare. Healthcare providers estimate mycosis fungoides, the most common form of CTCL, affects 1 in 1 million people in the United States.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of CTCL?
Symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include:
Bumps on your skin that might break open.
Hair loss
.
Itchy, rash-like discoloration all over your body.
Patches of
skin discoloration
.
Raised skin rash that might be flaky or itchy.
Swollen lymph nodes
.
Thickened skin on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.
What causes cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?
In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, T lymphocytes mutate (change) into cancerous cells that multiply uncontrollably. Healthcare providers don’t know exactly why CTCLs happen, or why some people are more likely than others to get them. Here are two possibilities:
Genetic variant (mutation)
: Researchers have identified some gene changes that might cause these conditions.
Infections
: Your
immune system
goes into overdrive when you have an infection. Your
bone marrow
reacts by creating more lymphocytes more quickly. Just like any production line, speeding up the process may lead to mistakes. In this case, the mistakes stem from
DNA
mutations that affect key genes in your lymphocytes. This eventually causes
lymphoma
.
Risk factors of CTCL
You’re more likely to develop cutaneous T-cell lymphoma if you:
Are Black.
Are over 50.
Have a weakened immune system.
Are
male
.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will review your medical history and do a
physical examination
, focusing on any patches or plaques (thickened areas) on your skin. They’ll ask you about your symptoms and review your health history, including any prior or current health conditions.
Tests used to diagnose the condition
Your healthcare provider will need to run tests to confirm a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma diagnosis. These tests may include:
Blood tests
.
Imaging tests like
CT scans
or
PET scans
.
Lymph node biopsy
.
Skin biopsy
.
Stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
Healthcare providers use
staging systems
to categorize, diagnose and treat cancers. The TNM classification system is the most common for staging CTCLs. This system describes:
The primary
tumor
, or where the cancer started
(T)
.
Whether the cancer has spread to nearby
lymph nodes
(N)
.
Whether the cancer has spread (
metastasized
) to distant areas of your body
(M)
.
The TNM system uses numbers and letters to stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma:
Stage of CTCL
Characteristics
Stage I (1)A
Discolored patches cover less than 10% of your skin.
Stage I (1)B
Raised, discolored patches cover more than 10% of your skin.
Stage II (2)A
You also have some swollen lymph nodes. You might have abnormal lymphocytes in your lymph nodes.
Stage II (2)B
You might have one or more skin tumors larger than 1 centimeter in size.
Stage III (3)A
Skin discoloration covers at least 80% of your body. You may or may not have swollen lymph nodes. Less than 5% of the lymphocytes in your blood are abnormal.
Stage III (3)B
You may or may not have swollen lymph nodes. Slightly more than 5% of the lymphocytes in your blood are abnormal.
Stage IV (4)A
Abnormal lymphocytes have spread to your lymph nodes or your blood.
Stage IV (4)B
The cancer has spread to other organs in your body, like your liver, lungs or bone marrow.
Stage of CTCL

Management and Treatment
How is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated?
Healthcare providers use several methods to treat CTCL, including:
Steroid
creams or ointments.
Light therapy
.
Extracorporeal photopheresis
(ECP).
Radiation therapy
.
Immunotherapy
.
Chemotherapy
.
Treatment is different for everyone. Your provider will let you know which options they recommend in your situation.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the prognosis for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?
Most CTCLs grow very slowly and aren’t life-threatening. But some people develop serious forms of the condition. Healthcare providers can’t
cure
CTCLs, but they can successfully manage symptoms with treatment.
But like all cancers, CTCLs can be fatal in their advanced stages. The sooner you start treatment, the better. That’s why it’s so important to tell a provider whenever you notice changes in your skin.

What is the survival rate for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?
The overall 10-year survival rate for people with early-stage (Stage I or II) CTCL is 90%. That means that 9 out of 10 people with this condition are still alive 10 years later. People with late-stage CTCL (Stage III or IV) have an overall 10-year survival rate of 53%.
Survival rates
are estimates. They can’t tell you how long you’ll live or how you’ll respond to treatment. To learn more about survival rates and what they mean for you, ask your healthcare provider.
Prevention
Can cutaneous T-cell lymphoma be prevented?
Most people who have CTCL have no changeable risk factors. So, there’s nothing you can do to prevent it. But researchers continue to study why these conditions happen.
How can I lower my risk?
Even though you can’t prevent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a weakened immune system could make you more susceptible to CTCLs and all types of cancer. Here are some ideas for keeping your immune system strong:
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.
Exercise regularly.
Get enough good-quality sleep.
Limit drinks containing alcohol
.
Maintain a weight that’s healthy for you.
Manage
stress
with
meditation
or other
mindfulness
activities.
Stay up to date on
vaccines
.
Try to
quit smoking
.
Wash your hands
often.

How do I take care of myself?
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affects your skin, making it dry, itchy and scaly. While treatment slows cancer growth and eases symptoms, some treatments may irritate already aggravated skin. Here are some suggestions that may help:
Advertisement
Keep your skin moist
. Use creams or ointments after you bathe or shower to lock in moisture and protect your skin. You may want to re-apply creams or ointments throughout your day and before you go to bed. In addition to protecting your skin, moisture combats dryness that makes your skin flake, helps with itchiness and may shield your skin from infection.
Protect your skin from irritation
. If you have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, your skin is more vulnerable. Everyday activities like being in the sun, using certain laundry detergents and soaps or even wearing certain fabrics can irritate your skin. Look for fragrance-free detergents and body soaps. Wear clothing that protects your skin from the sun and use sunscreen when going outside. Wear loose-fitting clothes that let your skin breathe.
Don’t scratch that itch
. For many people, incessantly itchy skin is a serious issue affecting their quality of life. Scratching can break open your skin and allow
bacteria
to get inside. This can lead to infections. Cold compresses (think bags of frozen vegetables), oatmeal baths and
antihistamines
may help soothe itchy skin.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Your healthcare provider will want to see you for regular checkups. Ask them how often you should see them for blood tests or skin exams.

Always contact your healthcare provider if you:
Notice any skin changes.
Think you might have a skin infection.
Develop a
fever
over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
It’s normal to assume that symptoms like rash and discoloration point to common skin conditions. It’s hard to imagine that a rare cancer could be the culprit. But it’s important to let a healthcare provider know any time you notice skin changes. They can determine the cause. Maybe it’s not cancer. But if it is, treatment is key. The sooner you start it, the better your overall outlook.
