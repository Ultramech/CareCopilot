Hemophilia A
Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder. It can cause excessive bleeding, bruising and joint pain. It happens when you don’t have enough clotting factor VIII (F8), a protein that helps your blood form clots. The treatments focus on reducing how often you have bleeding and how much bleeding you experience.

What Is Hemophilia A?
Hemophilia A is the most common type of
hemophilia
, a rare inherited
bleeding disorder
. If you have it, your blood doesn’t clot like it should, so it’s hard for you to control bleeding. This happens because you don’t have enough clotting factor VIII (F8), a protein that forms blood clots. Healthcare providers may call the disease hemophilia A factor VIII deficiency.

Moderate and severe hemophilia A may cause frequent, uncontrollable bleeding that happens without warning or cause. You may bruise very easily. Healthcare providers can’t cure this disease. But newer treatments to prevent or reduce bleeding are making a difference for people with moderate or severe forms of the disease.
Symptoms and Causes
Hemophilia A symptoms
More than half of people with hemophilia A have a severe form of this disease. They may experience
Excessive
bleeding
: This could be a nosebleed that you can’t stop. You may bleed more than expected after surgery, being injured or after a dental procedure. You may bleed for no apparent reason if you have a moderate or severe form of the disease.
Bruises
: You may develop painful bruises from everyday accidents, like bumping into a chair.
Joint pain
: The condition can cause blood to flow into your joints. The internal bleeding may make your joints swell.
People with a mild form of this disease often don’t have symptoms unless surgery or dental treatment causes bleeding that doesn’t slow down or stop.
Hemophilia A causes
A genetic change causes most types of hemophilia. The change accounts for 70% of hemophilia A cases. It affects the
F8
gene, which manages clotting factor VIII. You inherit hemophilia in an X-linked inheritance pattern, which is why hemophilia is more common in males than females:

The
F8
gene
sits on the X
chromosome
.
Females
inherit two X chromosomes, one from each of their biological parents. Males inherit an X chromosome from their mothers and a Y chromosome from their fathers.
A mother with a changed gene on one chromosome can pass that chromosome to their biological child.
A male child who inherits a chromosome with the gene change will have hemophilia. A female child carries the genetic change. Some may have mild hemophilia symptoms, like heavy periods.
Acquired hemophilia is another form of this disease. In this case, autoantibodies attack clotting factor VIII. These are proteins in your immune system that attack healthy cells, tissue and proteins. But hemophilia A can happen for no known reason.
Complications
People with hemophilia A may have an increased risk of bleeding into the brain. This is a life-threatening condition. You should get medical care right away if you have symptoms like double vision or a severe headache that doesn’t go away. Other potential complications are:
Anxiety and depression
Chronic pain
Increased risk of heart disease
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose hemophilia A
A healthcare provider may do several blood tests. For example, they do tests that show how long it takes for your blood to clot. Common tests include:
Complete blood count (CBC) to measure the amount of hemoglobin in your red blood cells, the size and number of your red blood cells, and the number and type of platelets and white blood cells in your blood
Activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin time tests, which measure how long it takes your blood to form clots
Prothrombin time (PT) test
Clotting factor test to check how well clotting factor VIII works
Genetic testing that can confirm changes in the
F8
gene
Management and Treatment
How do healthcare providers treat hemophilia A?
Treatment focuses on preventing bleeding, slowing it down and reducing the number of bleeding episodes. Common treatments are replacement therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, targeted therapy and gene therapy.
Replacement therapy
This treatment increases the amount of clotting factor VIII (F8) in your blood. You receive lab-made clotting factors or human plasma concentrates. People with mild hemophilia A may have this treatment before surgery to reduce bleeding risk.
Monoclonal antibody therapy
Monoclonal antibody therapy treats severe hemophilia A. It does two things: blocks a protein that keeps your blood from clotting and boosts an enzyme that helps your blood make clots. Marstacimab-hncq (Hympavzi
®
), emicizumab (Hemlibra
®
) and concizumab (Alhemo
®
) are examples of medications.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy interferes with mRNA for antithrombin. Antithrombin is a substance that prevents blood clots. Your liver makes this substance. mRNA, or messenger RNA, is a molecule that carries genetic information from DNA. The genetic information tells cells how to make specific substances.
In this treatment, targeted therapy keeps your liver from making antithrombin, Lower antithrombin levels in your bloodstream prevent or reduce how often you experience bleeding
.
Fitusiran
(Qfitlia
®
) is treatment for severe hemophilia A and hemophilia B.
Gene therapy
Gene therapy
for hemophilia A prevents bleeding by boosting factor VIII (F8) levels. You get a shot that contains a virus carrying a lab-made gene for clotting factor VIII. The virus carries the gene to liver cells that make factor VIII. The new gene tells the cells to make normal factor VIII. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec-rvox (Roctavian
®
) is the only gene therapy for severe hemophilia A.
When should I seek care?
Rarely, hemophilia A leads to bleeding in your brain that can be life-threatening. Go to the emergency room right away if you have severe headaches or double vision.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have hemophilia A?
Hemophilia A affects people differently. You may have a mild form where you can control bleeding. But people with moderate or severe forms of the disease will need medication and other support for the rest of their lives.

What is the life expectancy for someone with hemophilia A?
People with mild to moderate forms of hemophilia A have a normal life expectancy. Thanks to newer treatments, people with severe hemophilia A are living longer. Many things, like other health issues, may affect how long you’ll live. That’s why your healthcare provider is your best resource for life expectancy information.
Is there anything I can do to feel better?
Living with hemophilia A means being vigilant about treatment and taking extra steps to protect your overall health. Here are some suggestions:
Aim for a weight that’s right for you
: Bleeding that affects your joints can make it hard for you to move around. Managing your weight can take pressure off your joints, so you have less pain.
Stay active
: Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to reduce the risk of bleeding while staying active.
Consider counseling
: This disease can make you feel anxious and depressed. Mental health support may help you.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between hemophilia A and hemophilia B?
The
difference
is the type of factor deficiency that causes hemophilia. Hemophilia B happens when you don’t have enough clotting factor IX (F9).
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Hemophilia A is the most common form of a rare condition. Severe hemophilia A affects most people with this disease. It’s an unpredictable illness. It often causes frequent bleeding that disrupts your daily routine and your quality of life. Until recently, you may have had to arrange your schedule around treatments. That can be an exhausting and frustrating balancing act. Fortunately, there are newer treatments that may ease your symptoms and help bring more balance to your daily life.
