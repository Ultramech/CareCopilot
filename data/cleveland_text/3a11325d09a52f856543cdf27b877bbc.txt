resistant to antibiotics
. This means standard antibiotics don’t work to get rid of the infection, and it can be hard to treat.

Klebsiella pneumoniae
:
Classic
: These strains can live in your body and usually don’t harm you. But they can spread in hospitals and long-term care facilities. They usually infect people with medical devices or those who have other health conditions.
Hypervirulent
: These are more likely to cause severe illness and spread outside of healthcare facilities (community-acquired).

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Harmless bacteria live on and inside your body. But sometimes, they can get into parts of your body where they’re not supposed to be and make you sick. Even if you’re in the hospital, make sure you let your care team know if you have any new or concerning symptoms. This can help any infections get treatment as soon as possible.
