Shigellosis (Shigella Infection)
Shigellosis is an infection with Shigella bacteria. It causes diarrhea, vomiting, fever and stomach pain. You can get it from other people, contaminated food or from natural bodies of water like lakes and rivers. Shigellosis can get better on its own. But if your case is severe, you might need antibiotics. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

Policy
You might get
Shigella
from being around someone who has the infection — like if you touch the same surfaces or if you’re taking care of them while they’re sick. It may also contaminate bodies of water (think lakes and rivers) or foods you eat.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of shigellosis
Shigellosis commonly causes
diarrhea
. This can be watery or bloody. It might also contain mucus or pus. Other symptoms include:
Fever
Stomach pain and cramps
Vomiting
This combination of symptoms is also called
bacillary dysentery
.
You can also have a
Shigella
infection without symptoms. Even then, you can still be contagious.
Shigellosis causes
Shigella
bacteria cause shigellosis. You get it through contact with infected poop. It most commonly spreads through close contact with other people, especially in daycares or other places where people live or work closely with others. You can also get it from:
Lakes, rivers or other natural bodies of water
: You might swallow contaminated water while swimming or doing water sports.
Contaminated food
: Food can become contaminated with
Shigella
if someone with shigellosis prepares it without washing their hands well enough. Or if it’s washed or grown in contaminated water.
Direct contact with poop
: This could happen while changing diapers, during sex or while caring for someone with shigellosis.

infections include:
Gay and bisexual

weakened immune system

Complications of shigellosis
Shigella
infections can sometimes lead to complications. These include:
Dehydration
, a severe loss of fluids that can cause your body not to work properly
Bacterial infections in your blood
that can spread to other parts of your body
Seizures
, abnormal electrical activity in your brain
Reactive arthritis
, joint inflammation triggered by an infection
Hemolytic uremic syndrome
, a condition that damages the blood vessels in your kidneys
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose shigellosis
A healthcare provider can sometimes diagnose shigellosis based on your symptoms. They might test a
sample of your poop
(stool) to confirm.
Management and Treatment
How is it treated?
If your symptoms are manageable, you can usually take care of yourself at home until you feel better. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Ask your provider before taking anti-diarrheal medications. They can sometimes make symptoms worse and make the illness go on longer than it needs to.
In severe cases, you may need
antibiotics
to treat shigellosis. Your provider may prescribe ciprofloxacin or azithromycin. Take all antibiotics as prescribed, even if you start feeling better. If you become dehydrated, you’ll need treatment with fluids in the hospital.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Talk to a healthcare provider if you or someone in your family has diarrhea, especially if it lasts a long time. Go to the emergency room if you have severe diarrhea, vomiting, cramping or bloody diarrhea.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have shigellosis?
Most people with shigellosis feel better within about a week. But severe cases can last several weeks. Sometimes, it can take a few months for your body to feel like it’s returned to normal.
Prevention
Can I prevent shigellosis?
You can reduce your risk of a
Shigella
infection with these safety measures:
Wash your hands
with soap and water thoroughly and often, especially before and after eating, after using the bathroom and changing diapers, and before preparing food.
Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
Avoid swallowing water in pools, lakes or ponds.
Throw away soiled diapers in a lined garbage can with a lid.
Drink and cook with bottled water if you’re in an area where you’re unsure whether the water is safe.
If you or your partner has diarrhea, wait a week after recovery to have sex.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Shigella
infections are common and usually not serious — though, certainly, no one likes dealing with a bout of diarrhea. Drinking plenty of fluids can reduce your risk of complications. See a healthcare provider right away if you have signs of dehydration or if your symptoms last longer than a week.
