Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Encephalitis
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is swelling in your brain that can happen if a new or reactivated HSV infection moves to your brain. Symptoms include headache, confusion, personality or behavior changes, seizures and more. HSV encephalitis can be fatal. Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms.

Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSV) is brain swelling from a
viral infection
. It can happen if a new or reactivated
herpes simplex virus
infection moves to your brain. It can lead to permanent brain damage or death.

Call 911 or get to the nearest emergency room if you or someone you know if experiencing symptoms of HSV encephalitis, including seizures, confusion or personality changes.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of HSV encephalitis?
Symptoms of HSV encephalitis include:
Headache
Fever
Extreme lack of energy or decrease in consciousness (
lethargy
)
Confusion
or altered mental state
Personality or behavior changes
Seizures
Difficulty remembering or understanding words (
aphasia
)
Nausea and vomiting
People with HSV encephalitis don’t usually have herpes sores when encephalitis symptoms start.
What causes HSV encephalitis?
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes HSV encephalitis. Most cases are caused by HSV-1 (the main cause of oral herpes) but some are caused by HSV-2 (which can cause genital herpes).
Once you’re infected with herpes simplex virus, it never really leaves your body. You can go for long periods of time without symptoms when it’s inactive. But sometimes, it can reactivate and start causing symptoms again. You can get HSV encephalitis when you first get infected with HSV (primary infection) or from a reactivation.
How do you get herpes encephalitis?
You get herpes encephalitis when HSV travels to your brain. You can get HSV through:
Kissing/kisses
Skin-to-skin contact with sores
Oral, anal or vaginal sex
Sharing utensils or personal items (like razors)
Vertical transmission (from a pregnant
woman
to the fetus or baby)

Is HSV encephalitis contagious?
Encephalitis — brain swelling — isn’t contagious, but the virus that causes it is. That means that HSV spreads between people, but the infection doesn’t usually spread to your brain.
What are the complications of herpes encephalitis?
Complications of HSV encephalitis include:
Fluid in your brain (
cerebral edema
)
Increased intracranial pressure
(pressure inside of your head)
Seizures that last a long time or don’t stop (
status epilepticus
)
Brain herniation (when part of your brain sticks out through small holes into areas it shouldn’t)
Long-term or permanent neurological (brain and nerve) issues, like
memory loss
, movement disorders and difficulty with speech and language
Diagnosis and Tests
How is HSV encephalitis diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose HSV encephalitis by testing your spinal fluid with a
lumbar puncture (spinal tap)
. They’ll also use a
CT scan
or
MRI
to get pictures of your brain. Other tests providers might use to determine the cause of the infection or evaluate brain function include:
Blood tests
Nasal swab
EEG (electroencephalogram)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which detects the genetic material of the virus in your cerebral spinal fluid
Management and Treatment
How is HSV encephalitis treated?
Healthcare providers treat HSV encephalitis with intravenous (IV)
acyclovir
. This is an
antiviral medication
given directly into a vein. They may also treat you with
corticosteroids
to reduce swelling.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can you recover from herpes encephalitis?
Yes, you can recover from herpes encephalitis. But many people have long-term health issues, including:
Memory loss
Seizure disorders (like
epilepsy
)
Movement issues or involuntary muscle movements that make walking or everyday tasks difficult
Language or speech issues
Trouble thinking clearly
Personality or behavior changes
These issues may get better over time but might not ever completely go away. Sometimes, people get better but their symptoms come back again (relapse), usually within two months. This is more likely to happen in kids.
What can I expect if I have HSV encephalitis?
If you have HSV encephalitis, you’ll need to be diagnosed and treated at a hospital as soon as possible. Quick treatment gives you the best chance of recovery. You’ll need antiviral treatment for a few weeks. If you have ongoing neurological issues, you may need
physical
,
occupational
or
speech therapy
to manage your symptoms.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you’ve been diagnosed with herpes simplex in the past, talk to your healthcare provider about what you should do if you have a reactivation and what symptoms of encephalitis to look out for.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of herpes encephalitis. It’s often fatal if left untreated.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:

How do I take care of myself at home?
How do I take this medication?
Are there any symptoms I should look out for?
When should I follow up with you?
Prevention
Can HSV encephalitis be prevented?
If you have herpes, there aren’t any specific ways to prevent it from spreading to your brain. Ways to reduce your risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes HSV encephalitis include:
Avoid contact with herpes sores.
Get tested for
sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) and ask sex partners to get tested, too. Some STIs can spread even when you don’t have symptoms.
Use
condoms
or
dental dams
during sex.
Don’t share utensils or personal items.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is a serious condition that needs to be treated immediately. Even after treatment, the recovery can be long, and some conditions might never fully get better. Be gentle with yourself during your recovery journey. Your healthcare providers can help you know what to expect and give you support every step of the way.
