Prophylaxis/Preventive Care
Prophylaxis — or preventive care — is all the stuff you do to keep from getting sick. It includes things like vaccinations, health screenings and annual checkups. Prophylaxis can also help healthcare providers detect diseases and conditions in their earliest stages — before they get worse.

What is prophylaxis (preventive care)?
Prophylaxis is the medical term for “preventive care.” It’s the care you receive to stay healthy and reduce your chances of getting sick. Common prophylactic treatments include things like vaccinations, cancer screenings and annual checkups. Preventive care also helps healthcare providers detect certain conditions and diseases before they get worse. Prophylaxis is essential for long-lasting health and wellness.

Preventive care is different for everyone. Specific screenings and treatments depend on several factors like your:
Age
Medical history
Sex
Current health status
What are some prophylaxis (preventive care) examples?
Healthcare providers recommend prophylaxis during every life stage. Common preventive care examples include:
Annual wellness visits
Routine
blood tests
Vaccines
Cancer screenings
Prophylaxis during pregnancy
Preventive eye care
Preventive dental care
Wellness visits
Regular checkups help your provider keep track of your overall wellness. How often you need these visits depends partially on your age. For instance, people in their 20s may only need wellness exams every three years. On the other hand, someone in their 50s typically needs a wellness exam every year.
During each appointment, your
primary care physician (PCP)
will check several things, including your:
Height and weight
Blood pressure
Heart rate
Breathing function
Temperature
Eyes, ears, nose, throat and skin
These things help your provider gather valuable information and create a personalized treatment plan.
Vaccines
Prophylaxis includes immunizations to protect you from common diseases and infections. These immunizations include:
Childhood vaccines
, especially those listed on the
childhood immunization schedule
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These vaccines help prevent diseases like tuberculosis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella and
HPV (human papillomavirus)
.
Adult vaccines
, including flu shots and
COVID-19 vaccines
.

Cancer screenings
Screenings help providers catch some types of cancer early on. Detecting cancer before it spreads can make it easier to treat. The CDC recommends routine screenings for certain types of cancer, like:
Breast cancer
. Females age 40 and over should get routine
mammograms
to screen for breast abnormalities. Those with an increased risk of breast cancer may need screenings at an earlier age.
Cervical cancer
. Starting at age 25, anyone with a cervix should start screenings. Recommendations include taking an HPV test every five years and getting a
pap smear
every three years until age 65.
Colorectal (colon) cancer
. Experts recommend getting a
colonoscopy
every 10 years from age 45 to 75. If you have a family history of colon cancer, you may need screenings earlier and more frequently.
Lung cancer
. People who smoke or have a history of
smoking
should consider having yearly lung cancer screenings — using
CT (computed tomography) scans
— to check for lung lesions or abnormalities.
Your healthcare provider may recommend other types of screening tests, especially if you have an increased risk of certain cancers. These screenings might include:
Breast MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) to obtain additional images of breast tissue
CA-125 blood test
to monitor certain cancers like ovarian, fallopian tube or pancreatic
PSA test
to screen for prostate cancer
These are general guidelines. Ask your healthcare provider which screenings you need and when you should start getting them.
Prophylaxis (preventive care) for pregnancy
Pregnancy has unique needs, and you may need screenings for:
Anemia
Rh factor
incompatibility
Gestational diabetes
High blood pressure during pregnancy
Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Syphilis
Other types of prophylaxis during pregnancy include:
Prenatal vitamins
Breastfeeding
education
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test
Transvaginal ultrasound
Genetic counseling
Preventive eye care
Eye health is part of your overall wellness. To maintain healthy
vision
, get regular
eye exams
. The frequency of these visits depends on your situation, so be sure to ask your eye care provider for details.
Preventive dental care
Another essential aspect of prophylaxis is preventive dental care. The following can help stop oral health issues before they start:
Dental exams
. During these visits, your
dentist
can check the health of your
teeth
and
gums
. If they identify any issues, early treatment can prevent more serious conditions.
Dental cleanings
.
Plaque
and
tartar
increase your risk for
cavities
and
gum disease
. Regular cleanings remove these harmful deposits from your tooth surfaces.
Oral cancer screenings
. Most dentists do oral cancer screenings during every exam. They’ll look and feel around your mouth for signs of disease.
Oral hygiene
education
. Your dentist or
dental hygienist
can demonstrate how to brush and floss properly so you can keep your teeth and gums healthy between visits.

When should I schedule preventive care screenings?
Healthcare constantly evolves — and preventive care guidelines change with it. Your healthcare provider is the best person to ask about which screenings and treatments you need and when.
Does insurance cover prophylaxis?
Most insurance plans cover preventive health services at no cost. Exact coverage depends on certain factors like your age. Call your insurance provider to learn more about the details of your plan.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Lots of people go to the doctor when they’re sick. But visiting your provider when you’re feeling well might help you get sick less often. Preventive care helps your provider keep track of your overall health so they can recommend treatments tailored to your needs.
Whether you’re a teen, a new parent or an adult about to begin another decade of life, preventive care can reduce your risk for certain diseases. You can’t prevent everything. But prophylaxis gives you the best chance of staying healthy so you can live life to the fullest.
