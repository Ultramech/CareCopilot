Secondary Hypertension
Secondary hypertension is high blood pressure with an identifiable cause. Often, the cause is a medical condition or a medication you’re taking. An underlying condition may cause symptoms, but it’s possible to have no symptoms at all. That’s why blood pressure checks are so important. Treating the cause may lower your blood pressure.

What Is Secondary Hypertension?
Secondary hypertension is
high blood pressure
that has a known cause. The cause might be another medical condition, or certain medicines or substances you’re using. Often, treating this underlying cause can reduce your blood pressure to healthier levels. Secondary hypertension is different than
primary hypertension
, which doesn’t have one distinct cause.

Most cases of hypertension are primary.
Experts
used to think that only 5% to 10% of high blood pressure cases have secondary causes. But recent
research
shows the actual number of secondary hypertension cases may be much higher. This is because many cases go unrecognized or are diagnosed as primary hypertension.
Symptoms and Causes
Secondary hypertension causes
The causes of secondary hypertension (from most to least common) include:
Obstructive sleep apnea
Renal artery stenosis
Primary aldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome)
Medications, alcohol or other substances
Renal parenchymal disease
Tumors (
pheochromocytoma
and
paraganglioma
)
Cushing syndrome
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)
Coarctation of the aorta
Medications that can raise your blood pressure include:
Amphetamines
Angiogenesis
inhibitors, like
bevacizumab
, that
treat cancer
Antidepressants
Corticosteroids
(systemic), like
prednisone
and
methylprednisolone
Decongestants
Immunosuppressants
Oral contraceptives
NSAIDs
Second-generation (atypical)
antipsychotics
All medicines come with benefits and risks. If you think one of your medicines is raising your blood pressure, talk to a healthcare provider. Ask them if you should keep taking the medication.

Other substances that can cause secondary hypertension include:
Alcohol
Herbal supplements
Nicotine
Recreational drugs
Signs and symptoms of secondary hypertension
Secondary hypertension itself usually doesn’t have symptoms (unless your blood pressure is very high). But you may develop symptoms from the underlying condition that’s causing it.
The table below lists examples of symptoms you might have from various causes.
Possible symptoms
Cause of secondary hypertension
Increased sweating, hand tremors, feeling anxious or nervous, unexplained weight loss, fast heart rate, heart palpitations
Hyperthyroidism
Fatigue, hoarseness, weight gain, muscle weakness, numbness in hands, brain fog
Hyperthyroidism
Waking often at night, pauses in breathing while you sleep, snoring, night sweats, daytime fatigue, mood changes, trouble concentrating
Obstructive sleep apnea
Fatigue, excessive thirst, peeing more than usual, headaches, muscle cramps or weakness, blurred vision
Primary aldosteronism
Confusion, trouble sleeping, edema, fatigue, headaches, loss of appetite, dry or itchy skin (these occur as the disease gets worse)
Renal artery stenosis
Possible symptoms
Increased sweating, hand tremors, feeling anxious or nervous, unexplained weight loss, fast heart rate, heart palpitations

Cause of secondary hypertension
Renal artery stenosis
Your healthcare provider may suspect secondary hypertension if:
Your blood pressure is normally stable but suddenly goes up
You have high blood pressure before age 30
You develop dangerously high blood pressure (
hypertensive crisis
)
You’re taking at least three medicines to lower your blood pressure, but it’s still high (
resistant hypertension
)
Another red flag is high blood pressure that starts before
puberty
. If this happens to your child, their pediatrician may look for secondary causes.
What are the risks of secondary hypertension?
Untreated, secondary hypertension can lead to
hypertensive heart disease
. This is damage to your heart that results from years of high blood pressure. You may also develop complications from the condition that’s raising your blood pressure.
Secondary hypertension may be your provider’s first clue that you have another condition. Getting help for secondary hypertension may be the first step toward managing the underlying condition.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose this condition
Since there are many possible causes, it might take a while to reach a diagnosis. Your provider has to rule out some causes while investigating others in greater depth.
If your provider suspects you have secondary hypertension, they’ll start by:
Doing a
physical exam
Reviewing your medical history, including any medications or supplements you’re taking
Talking with you about what you eat and drink, including things like
sodium
and alcohol
Doing some basic tests like an electrocardiogram (
EKG/ECG
),
blood tests
and
urine tests
This information may help your provider find out why you have high blood pressure. If not, your provider will run further tests. The tests vary depending on the condition that your provider thinks you may have.
Additional blood and urine tests
CT angiogram
Kidney ultrasound
Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA)
Sleep study (polysomnography)
Management and Treatment
How is secondary hypertension treated?
Treatment depends on the cause. Since many different conditions can cause secondary hypertension, there are many possible treatments. Your healthcare provider will tailor a plan to your needs. They’ll explain what you can expect each step of the way.
As part of your plan, you may:
Take medications to lower your blood pressure
Take medications to treat other medical conditions
Change what you eat or drink
Limit alcohol
Quit smoking
Get regular physical activity
Use a device (like a
CPAP machine
)
Have a procedure or surgery

When should I see my healthcare provider?
See a provider for a
yearly checkup
. Your provider will check your blood pressure and let you know if it’s too high. Secondary hypertension itself doesn’t cause symptoms. So, you might not know your blood pressure is high — or that there’s a distinct reason why.
If you have high blood pressure, your provider will tell you how often to come in. They may also ask you to check your blood pressure at home. Follow their guidance and ask if you have any questions.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for secondary hypertension?
Secondary hypertension has a positive
outlook
with treatment. Early detection and treatment can lower the risk of damage to your
blood vessels
and
heart
from ongoing high blood pressure.
This means it’s possible for secondary hypertension to go away. Your blood pressure may return to normal once you treat the underlying cause. But it’s also possible for your blood pressure to remain higher than it should be. This might be because there’s another cause. If this happens, you may need to take medicine to keep it in the healthy range.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Having secondary hypertension means there’s an identifiable cause behind your raised numbers. Often, that’s a medical condition that providers can diagnose and treat.
Learning the “why” behind your high blood pressure might feel like a relief. But you might also have many new questions as you figure out what the underlying condition means for you. Now’s the time to learn as much as you can about your diagnosis. Ask your provider how you can manage the condition to help lower your blood pressure. You’ll work together to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you.
