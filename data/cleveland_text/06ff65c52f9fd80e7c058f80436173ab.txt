How does craniosacral therapy work?
CST focuses on the gentle placement of hands to help release tension in your body’s connective tissue. This is known as “
fascia
” (pronounced “fash-ee-uh”). Fascia is the Latin word for band. It’s a casing found throughout your body that holds your organs, glands, nerves, muscles, blood vessels, brain and spinal cord. The fascia forms a body-wide connective tissue network.
The human body is interconnected, both structurally and functionally. This means that one area of your body can affect another. The goal of CST is tension relief (fascial clearance). This may help other connected parts of your body function better through:
Self-regulation.
Self-correction.
Self-healing.

Treatment Details
What happens during craniosacral therapy?
A craniosacral therapy session is similar to massage therapy, except you stay fully clothed. To help you relax, you may hear soft music and the room may have low lighting.
The treatment session begins with a consultation with your trained therapist. They’ll ask you questions about your health history, concerns about your health and the goals of the session.
During your session, you’ll lie on a massage table or, if needed due to special circumstances, you may sit in a chair. Your therapist will check in with you during your session to make sure you’re comfortable. They’ll also explain what they’re doing before they touch your body to make sure you know what’s happening. If at any time you don’t feel comfortable, let your therapist know.
Your therapist will use their hands to apply gentle pressure to your head, neck, back (around your spinal column) or on areas of your body where you have symptoms.
It’s normal to feel a sense of deep relaxation during craniosacral therapy.
How long does craniosacral therapy take?
A session of craniosacral therapy may take between 30 minutes to one hour. You may need multiple sessions to achieve your goals.
Can you do craniosacral therapy on yourself?

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Craniosacral therapy is an alternative, noninvasive treatment that may help you relieve symptoms, especially pain. A trained healthcare provider will gently place their hands on your head, neck and back to alleviate tension. After a session, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. Take your time moving and standing up after your treatment to prevent falls. It may take a few sessions before you reach your goals for the treatment. If your symptoms get worse after a session, talk to your healthcare provider.
