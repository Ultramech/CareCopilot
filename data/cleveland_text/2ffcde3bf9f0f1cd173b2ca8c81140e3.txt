Policy
After completing four years of medical school, cardiologists spend three years learning general internal medicine as residents. Then, they get at least three more years of cardiology training after that.
Upon graduating cardiology training, cardiologists take board exams to obtain certification from a national governing group. They then maintain their certification through periodic testing.
Cardiologists must keep up with the latest advances in how to treat people to provide the best care. At the same time, they need to be experts at listening to how you describe your symptoms and finding the right solution for your issue.
What does a cardiologist do?
A cardiologist is a healthcare provider who can treat chest pain, high blood pressure and heart failure, as well as problems with your heart valves, blood vessels and other heart and vascular issues. They can order tests like electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, CTs (computed tomography), CMR (cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) and nuclear imaging to find out what’s wrong. With their diagnosis, they can order medicine, help you start healthier exercise and eating habits, or do
cardiac catheterization
. If you need heart surgery, a cardiologist can refer you to a
cardiothoracic surgeon
.

A cardiologist will do a
physical exam
and discuss your symptoms, medical history and biological family history with you. It’s important to let your cardiologist know if other people in your biological family have had heart problems because that can increase the chances of you having a heart problem.
Some basic information can give your cardiologist valuable insight into your heart and blood vessel health, like your:
Weight.
Blood pressure
.
Cholesterol levels
.
Blood glucose (sugar) levels
.
Your provider will look at all of this information and any test results to figure out your risk factors for heart problems. They’ll also want to know if you smoke, how much physical activity you get, what you eat and which medicines you’re taking.

Do I need a referral to see a cardiologist?
It depends. Some insurance plans may require you to get a referral from your
primary care provider
, so be sure to check with your insurance company for details. This can help you avoid the unwelcome surprise of a higher cost than you expected when visiting a cardiologist. It’s usually more expensive to see a specialist like a cardiologist than your primary care provider. But following your insurance company’s rules saves you money.
Where do cardiologists work?
You may see a cardiologist in the hospital where they work. Other cardiologists may see you in their own private offices. They may send you to a hospital or another medical facility for testing or procedures.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
A cardiologist can have a major impact on your life. They may save your life after a heart attack. Or they may help you avoid a heart attack. Depending on your case, you may need a specific type of cardiologist who’s an expert in the condition you have. Your primary care provider or a trusted friend can refer you to a cardiologist. But you should make sure you’re comfortable with the cardiologist you see. You should feel that you can ask questions about anything that isn’t clear.
