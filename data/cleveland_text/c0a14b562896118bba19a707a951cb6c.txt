Gingivostomatitis
Gingivostomatitis is an oral infection that causes painful sores. Certain viruses and bacteria cause it, and poor oral hygiene makes you more likely to get it. Treatment usually involves antivirals or antibiotics — and you can avoid triggers to reduce your risk of flare-ups.

Overview
What is gingivostomatitis?
Gingivostomatitis is a painful infection that can cause
blisters
on your lips and
canker sores
in your
mouth
. Certain viruses and bacteria cause it, and poor oral hygiene can make it worse. Gingivostomatitis is most common in young children, but anyone can get it. Gingivostomatitis isn’t the same as
gingivitis
, the earliest stage of
gum disease
.

Gingivostomatitis usually doesn’t cause serious health issues, especially when you get prompt treatment. But it can be very painful. It’s also contagious. You can pass it to another person through things like kissing or sharing eating utensils.
How common is gingivostomatitis?
Gingivostomatitis is quite common, partly because the condition can come back (recur) repeatedly in the form of flare-ups. Once initially infected, approximately 40% of children will develop recurring
mouth sores
.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of gingivostomatitis?
Gingivostomatitis symptoms can vary, and they may be mild or severe, including:
Bad breath (halitosis)
.
Dry mouth (xerostomia)
.
Fever
.
Headaches
.
Loss of appetite
due to mouth pain.
Painful sores on your lips,
gums
,
tongue
or inner cheeks.
Red, tender or
swollen gums
.
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck
.
The above symptoms can affect both children and adults.
What causes gingivostomatitis?
Gingivostomatitis can develop due to certain
viruses
or
bacteria
, including:
Herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1).
The most common cause of gingivostomatitis, HSV-1 is the same virus that causes
cold sores
. When HSV-1 causes gingivostomatitis, providers call it “herpes simplex gingivostomatitis” or “herpetic gingivostomatitis.” (Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis refers to the first time you encountered the virus. Secondary herpetic gingivostomatitis refers to each flare-up, or reactivation, of the virus.)
Streptococcus
. This bacteria commonly causes
strep throat
or blood infections, but it can also result in gingivostomatitis.
Actinomyces
. This bacteria naturally occurs in your mouth, but it can lead to gingivostomatitis if it enters your bloodstream. This can be a side effect of
dental trauma
or
oral surgery
.
Coxsackieviruses
. Coxsackieviruses are viruses that usually spread through unwashed hands or other surfaces contaminated with feces (poop). Coxsackieviruses also commonly cause
hand, foot and mouth disease
.

Gingivostomatitis risk factors
Poor oral hygiene, like not brushing or flossing enough, is the main risk factor for gingivostomatitis.
If you have herpetic gingivostomatitis, you’re more likely to experience flare-ups when exposed to:
Fever.
Trauma.
Stress
.
UV light.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is gingivostomatitis diagnosed?
Healthcare providers can usually diagnose gingivostomatitis during a
physical examination
. Your provider will also ask about symptoms.
They may also recommend a swab culture or
biopsy
of the affected area to confirm which type of bacteria or virus caused the infection. They’ll send the sample to a
pathologist
for testing.
Management and Treatment
How is gingivostomatitis treated?
Gingivostomatitis treatment may include
antibiotics
or
antivirals
to get rid of the infection and ease your symptoms. In some cases, your healthcare provider will need to clean the affected areas.
To further ease gingivostomatitis symptoms:
Take over-the-counter (OTC)
pain relievers
, like
acetaminophen
(Tylenol
®
) or
ibuprofen
(Advil
®
).
Rinse your mouth with an antibacterial mouthwash twice a day.
Gently swish with warm salt water a few times daily to soothe your mouth.
Avoid eating hot, spicy or salty foods.
Brush twice a day and floss once a day.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the outlook for gingivostomatitis?

After mouth sores appear, you’ll be contagious with gingivostomatitis for about seven days. You should be fever-free for at least 24 hours before having close contact with anyone else.

oral hygiene
