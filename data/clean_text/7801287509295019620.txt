Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir AF is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Emtricitabine and tenofovir AF are in a class of medications called nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They work by slowing the spread of HIV in the body.
Although emtricitabine and tenofovir AF will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses. Taking these medications and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of giving the HIV virus to other people.
How should this medicine be used?
Emtricitabine and tenofovir AF comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take with or without food once a day. Take at around the same time every day.
Take emtricitabine and tenofovir AF exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Continue to take emtricitabine and tenofovir AF even if you feel well. Do not stop taking emtricitabine and tenofovir AF without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking emtricitabine and tenofovir AF even for a short time, or if you skip doses, the virus may become resistant to medications and may be harder to treat.
