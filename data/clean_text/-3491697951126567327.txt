Notice:
Lodoxamine opthalmic has been discontinued in the US. Because this drug is no longer available in the US market, the material in this monograph is no longer updated by AHFS DI. If this drug is used in countries other than the U.S., it is essential that the manufacturers’ labeling be consulted for more recently available information.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Ophthalmic lodoxamide is used to treat redness, burning, itching, and swelling of the eyes that is caused by allergic reactions. Lodoxamide is in a class of medications called mast cell stabilizers. It works by preventing allergic reactions.
How should this medicine be used?
Ophthalmic lodoxamide comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. It is usually instilled four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use lodoxamide eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor.
To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.
Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.
While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.
Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.
Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.
While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.
Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.
Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.
Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.
If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.
Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.
Wash your hands to remove any medication.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using lodoxamide eye drops,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to lodoxamide or any other drugs.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using lodoxamide eye drops, call your doctor.
you should know that lodoxamide solution contains benzalkonium chloride, which can be absorbed by soft contact lenses. If you wear contact lenses, remove them before instilling lodoxamide and put them back in 10 to 15 minutes later.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Instill the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not instill a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Lodoxamide eye drops may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
temporary stinging or burning in the eyes
headache
increased eye tearing
dry eyes
sneezing
blurred or unstable vision
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop using lodoxamide eye drops and call your doctor immediately:

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not use the eye drops if the solution has changed color, is cloudy, or contains particles.
Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.
