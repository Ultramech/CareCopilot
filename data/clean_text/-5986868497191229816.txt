Why is this medication prescribed?
Pindolol is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Pindolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure.
High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Pindolol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken two times a day. To help you remember to take pindolol, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pindolol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of pindolol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Talk to your doctor about how you feel and about any symptoms you experience during this time.
Pindolol helps control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take pindolol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pindolol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking pindolol, you may experience serious heart problems such as angina (chest pain), heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually. Your doctor will watch you carefully and will probably tell you to avoid physical activity during this time.
Other uses for this medicine
Pindolol is also used sometimes to prevent angina (chest pain). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking pindolol,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to pindolol, other medications, or any of the ingredients in pindolol tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking pindolol. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have a slow or irregular heartbeat, heart failure, or asthma or other lung diseases. Your doctor may tell you not to take pindolol.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes; thyroid problems; or heart, liver, or kidney disease. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction to a food or any other substance.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking pindolol, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking pindolol.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that pindolol may increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and prevent the warning signs and symptoms that would tell you that your blood sugar is low. Let your doctor know if you are unable to eat or drink normally or are vomiting while you are taking pindolol. You should know the symptoms of low blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.
you should know that if you have allergic reactions to different substances, your reactions may be worse while you are taking pindolol, and your allergic reactions may not respond to the usual doses of injectable epinephrine.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Pindolol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
dizziness or lightheadedness
excessive tiredness
difficulty sleeping
unusual dreams
nervousness
weakness

nausea
cold hands or feet

What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will need to determine your response to pindolol. Your doctor may ask you to check your pulse (heart rate). Ask your pharmacist or doctor to teach you how to take your pulse. If your pulse is faster or slower than it should be, call your doctor.
Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.
Keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.
