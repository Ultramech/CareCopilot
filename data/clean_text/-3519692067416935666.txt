Why is this medication prescribed?
Capmatinib is used to treat a certain type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body. Capmatinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.
How should this medicine be used?
Capmatinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice daily with or without food. Take capmatinib at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take capmatinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
If you vomit after taking capmatinib, do not take another dose. Continue your regular dosing schedule.
Your doctor may need to temporarily or permanently stop your treatment or decrease your dose of capmatinib during your treatment.
