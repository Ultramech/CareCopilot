Why is this medication prescribed?
Atezolizumab injection is used alone or with other chemotherapy medications to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. Atezolizumab injection is also used in combination with other chemotherapy medications to treat certain types of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and melanoma (a type of skin cancer) in adults. Atezolizumab is also used alone to treat certain types of alveolar soft tissue sarcomas (cancer that forms in muscles, fat, or nerves) in adults and children 2 years of age or older. Atezolizumab injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the action of a certain protein in cancer cells. This helps the person's immune system to fight against the cancer cells, and helps to slow tumor growth.
Your doctor will review your specific type of cancer and past treatment history and other available treatments to determine if atezolizumab injection is right for you.
How should this medicine be used?
Atezolizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a vein over 30 to 60 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or medical facility. It is usually injected once every 2, 3, or 4 weeks depending on your dose. The length of your treatment will be decided by your doctor and depends on the type of cancer being treated, how well your body responds to the medication, and the side effects that you experience.
Atezolizumab injection may cause serious reactions during the infusion of the medication. A doctor or nurse will monitor you carefully while you are receiving the medication. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: flushing, fever, chills, shaking, dizziness, feeling faint, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, itching, rash, back or neck pain, or swelling of the face or lips.
Your doctor may need to slow down your infusion, delay or stop your treatment, or treat you with other medications if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with atezolizumab injection.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with atezolizumab injection and each time you receive the medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
