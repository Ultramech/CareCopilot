Notice:
Gemifloxacin has been discontinued in the US. Because this drug is no longer available in the US market, the material in this monograph is no longer updated ASHP PMI. If this drug is used in countries other than the U.S., it is essential that the manufacturers’ labeling be consulted for more recently available information.
IMPORTANT WARNING:
Taking gemifloxacin increases the risk that you will develop tendinitis (swelling of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) or have a tendon rupture (tearing of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) during your treatment or for up to several months afterward. These problems may affect tendons in your shoulder, your hand, the back of your ankle, or in other parts of your body. Tendinitis or tendon rupture may happen to people of any age, but the risk is highest in people over 60 years of age. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a kidney, heart, or lung transplant; kidney disease; a joint or tendon disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function); or if you participate in regular physical activity. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking oral or injectable steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol®), or prednisone (Rayos®). If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendinitis, stop taking gemifloxacin, rest, and call your doctor immediately: pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, or difficulty in moving a muscle. If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendon rupture, stop taking gemifloxacin and get emergency medical treatment: hearing or feeling a snap or pop in a tendon area, bruising after an injury to a tendon area, or inability to move or to bear weight on an affected area.
Taking gemifloxacin may cause changes in sensation and nerve damage that may not go away even after you stop taking moxifloxacin. This damage may occur soon after you begin taking gemifloxacin. Tell your doctor if you have ever had peripheral neuropathy (a type of nerve damage that causes tingling, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet). If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking gemifloxacin and call your doctor immediately: numbness, tingling, pain, burning, or weakness in the arms or legs; or a change in your ability to feel light touch, vibrations, pain, heat, or cold.
Taking gemifloxacin may affect your brain or nervous system and cause serious side effects. This can occur after the first dose of gemifloxacin. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures, epilepsy, cerebral arteriosclerosis (narrowing of blood vessels in or near the brain that can lead to stroke or ministroke), stroke, changed brain structure, or kidney disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking gemifloxacin and call your doctor immediately: seizures; tremors; dizziness; lightheadedness; headaches that won't go away (with or without blurred vision); difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; nightmares; not trusting others or feeling that others want to hurt you; hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist); thoughts or actions towards hurting or killing yourself; feeling restless, anxious, nervous, depressed, or confused; memory problems, or other changes in your mood or behavior.
Taking gemifloxacin may worsen muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness) and cause severe difficulty breathing or death. Tell your doctor if you have myasthenia gravis. Your doctor may tell you not to take gemifloxacin. If you have myasthenia gravis and your doctor tells you that you should take gemifloxacin, call your doctor immediately if you experience muscle weakness or difficulty breathing during your treatment.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking gemifloxacin.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with gemifloxacin. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Gemifloxacin is used to treat pneumonia. Gemifloxacin may also be used to treat bronchitis but should not be used for this condition if there are other treatment options. Gemifloxacin is in a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections.
Antibiotics such as gemifloxacin do not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Gemifloxacin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day for 5 or 7 days. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. Your doctor will tell you how long to take gemifloxacin. Take gemifloxacin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take gemifloxacin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Do not take gemifloxacin with dairy products such as milk or yogurt, or calcium-fortified juices alone. However, you may take gemifloxacin with a meal that includes these foods or drinks.
Swallow the tablets whole with plenty of water; do not split, chew, or crush them.
You should begin feeling better during the first few days of treatment with gemifloxacin. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.
Take gemifloxacin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking gemifloxacin without talking to your doctor unless you experience certain serious side effects that are listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING and SIDE EFFECTS sections. If you stop taking gemifloxacin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
