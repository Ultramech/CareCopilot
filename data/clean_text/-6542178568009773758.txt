Why is this medication prescribed?
Exagamglogene autotemcel is used in adults and children 12 years of age and older who have sickle cell disease (SCD; inherited disease of the red blood cells that cause them to not move as well causing disruption of blood flow) with a history of vaso-occlusive events (complications from SCD that may include pain crises, chest pain, and stroke) or with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT; inherited blood disorder where body does not product enough beta globin, required to make hemoglobin, so blood transfusions are required for survival). Exagamglogene autotemcel is in a class of medications called autologous cellular immunotherapy, a type of medication prepared using cells from the patient's own blood. It works by helping the body to make hemoglobin which helps keep cells from sickling in SCD and helps produce more healthy hemoglobin in TDT patients.
How should this medicine be used?
Exagamglogene autotemcel comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or infusion center. Before you receive your exagamglogene autotemcel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for exagamglogene autotemcel.
Before your dose of exagamglogene autotemcel injection is to be given, a sample of your blood stem cells will be taken at a hospital or treatment center using a process called mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). This process usually takes about 1 week and may need to be repeated. The sample will be sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of exagamglogene autotemcel injection. It may take up to 6 months after your blood stem cells are collected before they are ready to be given to you. Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you.
You will have to stay in the hospital for about 4-6 weeks after you receive your exagamglogene autotemcel dose to monitor you for any side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for mobilization and apheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
