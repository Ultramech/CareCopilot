Why is this medication prescribed?
Rilpivirine is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Rilpivirine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood.
Although rilpivirine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses. Taking these medications and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of giving the HIV virus to other people.
How should this medicine be used?
Rilpivirine comes as a tablet and as a tablet for suspension (a tablet to dissolve in water) to take by mouth. Take with a meal (not just a protein drink or yogurt) once a day.
Take rilpivirine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
You will take other medications for HIV while you are taking rilpivirine. Your doctor will tell you whether these medications should be taken at the same time as rilpivirine, or several hours before or after you take rilpivirine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the times you should take your medications.
Your doctor will decide which rilpivirine product is right for you. Rilpivirine tablets and tablets for suspension cannot be substituted for each other.
To give rilpivirine tablet for suspension:
Place the tablet for oral suspension in a cup and then add 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of room temperature drinking water. Do not chew, crush, or swallow the tablet whole.
Swirl the cup for 1-2 minutes to dissolve the tablet. The mixture may look cloudy.
You may add 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of water, orange juice, milk or applesauce to the mixture to make it easier to take the medicine. But the entire amount must be swallowed right away. Make sure no medicine is left in the cup. If needed, add 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of water and mix and swallow right away,
Rilpivirine controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to take rilpivirine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rilpivirine without talking to your doctor. When your supply of rilpivirine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking rilpivirine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
