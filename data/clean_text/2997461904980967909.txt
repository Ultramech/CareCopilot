IMPORTANT WARNING:
Terbutaline should not be used to stop or prevent premature labor in pregnant women, especially in women who are not in a hospital. Terbutaline has caused serious side effects, including death, in pregnant women who took the medication for this purpose. Terbutaline has also caused serious side effects in newborns whose mothers took the medication to stop or prevent labor.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Terbutaline is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Terbutaline is in a class of medications called beta agonists. It works by relaxing and opening the airways, making it easier to breathe.
How should this medicine be used?
Terbutaline comes as a tablet to take by mouth. The tablets are usually taken three times a day, once every six hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take terbutaline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Each dose of terbutaline should control your symptoms for at least 6 hours after you take it. If you find that your symptoms return before it is time for your next dose, that terbutaline does not control your symptoms as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment, or that your symptoms are getting worse, call your doctor. These may be signs that your condition is worsening.
Terbutaline may control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use terbutaline even if you feel well. Do not stop taking terbutaline without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking terbutaline,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to terbutaline, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in terbutaline tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medications or have stopped taking them within the past two weeks: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar) and tranylcypromine (Parnate).
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking terbutaline. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, heart disease, high blood pressure, an overactive thyroid gland, diabetes, or seizures.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking terbutaline, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking terbutaline.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
