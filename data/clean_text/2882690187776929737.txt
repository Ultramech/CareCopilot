Why is this medication prescribed?
Ergocalciferol is used in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism (condition in which the body does not produce enough parathyroid hormone), refractory rickets (softening and weakening of bones that does not respond to treatment), and familial hypophosphatemia (rickets or osteomalacia caused by an inherited condition with a decreased ability to break down vitamin D in the body). Ergocalciferol is in a class of medications called vitamin D analogs. It works by helping the body to use more of the calcium found in foods or supplements.
How should this medicine be used?
Ergocalciferol comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily. Take ergocalciferol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ergocalciferol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew or crush them.
Your doctor may change your dose depending on your body's response to ergocalciferol.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking ergocalciferol,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ergocalciferol, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ergocalciferol capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking ergocalciferol. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
the following nonprescription products may interact with ergocalciferol: mineral oil; vitamin D supplements; calcium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking ergocalciferol. Do not start any of these medications while taking ergocalciferol without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have high blood levels of calcium and vitamin D, an abnormal sensitivity to high levels of vitamin D, or if you have malabsorption syndrome (problems absorbing food). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take ergocalciferol.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ergocalciferol, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Ergocalciferol will work only if you also get the right amount of calcium from the foods you eat. If you get too much calcium from foods, you may experience serious side effects from taking ergocalciferol. If you do not get enough calcium from foods, ergocalciferol will not control your condition. Your doctor will tell you which foods are good sources of calcium and how many servings you need each day. If you find it difficult to eat enough of these foods, tell your doctor. In that case, your doctor can prescribe or recommend a calcium supplement.
Your doctor may also prescribe a low-phosphate diet during your treatment with ergocalciferol. Follow these directions carefully.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Ergocalciferol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
pale skin
tiredness
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately:
feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination, or weight loss
drowsiness
muscle aches, stiffness, and weakness
Ergocalciferol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
