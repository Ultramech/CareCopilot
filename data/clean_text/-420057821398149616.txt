Why is this medication prescribed?
Cholecalciferol (vitamin D
3
) is used as a dietary supplement when the amount of vitamin D in the diet is not enough. People most at risk for vitamin D deficiency are older adults, breastfed infants, people with dark skin, obese people, and those with limited sun exposure, or gastrointestinal disease (GI; affecting the stomach or intestines) such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D
3
) is also used along with calcium to prevent and treat bone diseases such as rickets (softening and weakening of bones in children caused by lack of vitamin D), osteomalacia (softening and weakening of bones in adults caused by lack of vitamin D), and osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily). Cholecalciferol (vitamin D
3
) is in a class of medications called vitamin D analogs. Cholecalciferol is needed by the body for healthy bones, muscles, nerves, and to support the immune system. It works by helping the body to use more of the calcium found in foods or supplements.
How should this medicine be used?
Cholecalciferol (vitamin D
3
) comes as a capsule, gel capsule, chewable gel (gummy), tablet, and liquid drops to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice daily depending on the preparation, your age, and your medical condition(s). Cholecalciferol is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe cholecalciferol to treat certain conditions. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking a cholecalciferol (vitamin D) supplement. Take cholecalciferol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your product label or doctor's instructions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cholecalciferol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than recommended by your doctor.
Cholecalciferol liquid drops may be added to your child's food or drink.
