Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol is used to control wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways, that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). It is also used in adults to control wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma. Fluticasone is in a class of medications called steroids. Umeclidinium is in a class of medication called anticholinergics. Vilanterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). The combination of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. It is usually inhaled once a day. Inhale fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part that you do not understand. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Do not use fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol inhalation during a sudden COPD or asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short acting (rescue) inhaler to use during COPD or asthma attacks.
Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol inhalation controls COPD or asthma but does not cure it. Continue to use fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol without talking to your doctor. If you stop using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol inhalation, your symptoms may return.
Before you use fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use the inhaler. Practice using your inhaler while they watch you.
After inhalation, rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out; do not swallow the water.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.

Keep this medication in the foil tray it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from sunlight, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Dispose of the inhaler 6 weeks after you remove it from the foil overwrap or after every blister has been used (when the dose indicator reads 0), whichever comes first.
Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.
