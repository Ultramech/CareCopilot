Why is this medication prescribed?
Nonprescription (over-the-counter) capsaicin patches (Aspercreme
®
Warming, Salonpas
®
Pain Relieving Hot, others) are used to relieve minor pain in muscles and joints caused by arthritis, backaches, muscle strains, bruises, cramps, and sprains. Prescription capsaicin patches (Qutenza
®
) are used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; the burning, stabbing pain or aches that may last for months or years after an attack of shingles). Prescription capsaicin patches (Qutenza
®
) are also used to relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy (numbness or tingling due to nerve damage in people who have diabetes). Capsaicin is a substance that is found in chili peppers. It works by affecting nerve cells in the skin that are associated with pain, which results in decreased activity of these nerve cells and a reduced sense of pain.
How should this medicine be used?
Prescription transdermal capsaicin comes as an 8% patch (Qutenza
®
) to be applied to the skin by a doctor or nurse at a doctor's office. Your doctor will choose the best place to apply the patch(es) in order to treat your condition and will mark the area where the patch should be placed. If transdermal capsaicin (Qutenza
®
) is used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia, up to 4 patches are usually applied for 60 minutes once every 3 months. If transdermal capsaicin (Qutenza
®
) is used to relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy, up to 4 patches are usually applied for 30 minutes once every 3 months. Your doctor may apply a topical medicine before applying the capsaicin patch to help prevent pain and burning from the patch. If pain still occurs after applying the patch, your doctor or nurse may apply cool compress or give you pain medicine by mouth to help.
Nonprescription (over the counter) transdermal capsaicin comes as a 0.025% patch (Aspercreme
®
Warming, Salonpas
®
Pain Relieving Hot, others) to apply up to 3 or 4 times daily and for no more than 8 hours per application. Use nonprescription capsaicin patches exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often or for a longer period of time than directed by the package instructions.
Your doctor may apply an anesthetic to numb your skin before applying prescription transdermal capsaicin (Qutenza
®
). Tell your doctor if you experience pain at the application site. Your doctor may use a cold pack or give you another medication for pain.
Apply nonprescription (over the counter) capsaicin patches to a clean, dry, hairless area of skin as directed by the package directions. Do not apply capsaicin patches to skin that is broken, damaged, cut, infected, or covered by a rash. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area.
Wash your hands with soap and water to remove any medicine that may have gotten on them. Do not touch your eyes until you have washed your hands.
Do not let the nonprescription (over the counter) patches come in contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. If the patch does touch your eye or if irritation of your eyes, nose, or mouth occurs, wash the affected area immediately with water. Call a doctor if eye, skin, nose, or throat irritation.
While you are wearing a capsaicin patch and for a few days after treatment with prescription transdermal capsaicin, protect the treated area from direct heat such as heating pads, electric blankets, hair dryers, heat lamps, saunas, and hot tubs. In addition, vigorous exercise should be avoided for a few days following treatment with prescription transdermal capsaicin. You should not shower or take a bath while you are wearing a nonprescription (over the counter) capsaicin patch. You should remove the patch at least 1 hour before showering or taking a bath; do not apply capsaicin patches immediately after showering or taking a bath.
Stop using nonprescription capsaicin patches and call your doctor if severe burning occurs or if your pain worsens, improves and then worsens, or lasts longer than 7 days.

).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children and pets. Store it at room temperature.
It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.
