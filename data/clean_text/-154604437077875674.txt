KCNB1 encephalopathy
Description
KCNB1
encephalopathy is a condition characterized by abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and developmental delay.
Most people who have
KCNB1
encephalopathy have more than one type of seizure. The seizure types that can occur in people with this condition include uncontrolled muscle twitches (myoclonic seizures), uncontrolled muscle stiffness (tonic seizures), loss of consciousness with muscle rigidity and convulsions (tonic-clonic seizures), sudden episodes of weak muscle tone (atonic seizures), sudden falls (drop attacks), or partial or complete loss of consciousness (absence seizures).
Some individuals with
KCNB1
encephalopathy do not develop seizures, but they do have an abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the brain called continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS). This pattern occurs during sleep, specifically during deep (slow-wave) sleep.
Children with
KCNB1
encephalopathy have delayed development of speech and motor skills, such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in some affected individuals can contribute to this delay. Many children with the condition eventually walk independently, but some individuals require assistance. Some affected individuals can communicate verbally using simple sentences, while others never develop the skill.
About half of individuals with
KCNB1
encephalopathy also have neurodevelopmental disorders, including
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and
autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). In
KCNB1
encephalopathy, problems with vision, digestion, and sleep can rarely occur.
Frequency
The prevalence of
KCNB1
encephalopathy
is unknown. More than 65 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
Causes
As its name indicates,
KCNB1
encephalopathy is caused by mutations in the
KCNB1
gene. The
KCNB1
gene provides instructions for making one part of a potassium
channel
called Kv2.1. Potassium channels transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium in and out of cells. This activity plays a key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Kv2.1 channels are found primarily in nerve cells (
neurons
) in the brain where they are involved in regulating activity of neurons and sending electrical signals in the brain.
Most
KCNB1
gene mutations that cause
KCNB1
encephalopathy lead to an altered protein that results in impaired Kv2.1 channel function. As a result, the channels cannot regulate the flow of potassium ions in neurons, which disrupts normal communication between these cells. Impaired channel function disrupts normal brain development and leads to seizures, intellectual disability, and other features of encephalopathy that occur in this condition.

KCNB1
Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.
