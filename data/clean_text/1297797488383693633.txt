IMPORTANT WARNING:
Metronidazole can cause cancer in laboratory animals. However, it can be useful when taken to heal ulcers. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this combination containing metronidazole in the treatment of your ulcers.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline is used along with other ulcer medications to treat duodenal ulcers. It is in a class of medications called antibacterial agents. It works by preventing the growth and spread of Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which often occurs with ulcers. Treating this infection keeps ulcers from coming back.
How should this medicine be used?
Bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline (Helidac
®
) comes as two chewable bismuth tablets, one metronidazole tablet, and one tetracycline capsule to take together by mouth. Bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline (Pylera
®
) come as a capsule to take by mouth. It usually is taken four times a day, at meals and at bedtime for 10 days (Pylera
®
) or 14 days (Helidac
®
). Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take this medication exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you are taking bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline (Helidac
®
), chew and swallow the bismuth tablets. Swallow the metronidazole tablet and tetracycline capsule whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces [240 milliliters]). If you are taking bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline (Pylera
®
), swallow the capsules whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces [240 milliliters]). It is especially important to take the bedtime dose with plenty of fluid to prevent irritation of your throat and stomach.
Take bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after you eat or drink foods that contain calcium, such as dairy products and calcium-fortified juices and foods.
Continue to take this medication even if you feel well. Do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking this medication too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
