Why is this medication prescribed?
Ceftibuten is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as bronchitis (infection of the airway tubes leading to the lungs); and infections of the ears, throat, and tonsils. Ceftibuten is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.
Antibiotics such as ceftibuten will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Ceftibuten comes as a capsule and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day for 10 days. Take the suspension on an empty stomach, at least 2 hours before or 1 hour after eating; the capsules can be taken with or without food. Take ceftibuten at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ceftibuten exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ceftibuten. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
Continue to take ceftibuten even if you feel better. If you stop taking ceftibuten too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Other uses for this medicine
Ceftibuten is also sometimes used to treat urinary tract infections. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking ceftibuten,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ceftibuten; other cephalosporin antibiotic such as cefaclor (Ceclor), cefadroxil cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol), cefdinir, cefditoren (Spectracef), cefepime (Maxipime), cefixime (Suprax), cefotaxime (Claforan), cefotetan, cefoxitin (Mefoxin), cefpodoxime, cefprozil, ceftaroline (Teflaro), ceftazidime (Fortaz, Tazicef, in Avycaz), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), cefuroxime (Zinacef),and cephalexin (Keflex); penicillin antibiotics; or any other medications. Also tell your doctor if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in ceftibuten capsules or suspension.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking, or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had gastrointestinal disease (GI; affecting the stomach or intestines), especially colitis (condition that causes swelling in the lining of the colon [large intestine]), or kidney disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking ceftibuten, call your doctor.
If you have diabetes, you should know that ceftibuten suspension solution contains sucrose (sugar).
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
