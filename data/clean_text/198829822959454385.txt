Why is this medication prescribed?
Amphotericin B liposomal injection is used to treat fungal infections such as cryptococcal meningitis (a fungal infection of the lining of the spinal cord and brain) and visceral leishmaniasis (a parasitic disease that usually affects spleen, liver, and bone marrow) in certain people. It is also used to treat certain fungal infections in people who cannot receive conventional amphotericin B therapy. Amphotericin B liposomal injection is in a class of medications called antifungals. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.
How should this medicine be used?
Amphotericin B liposomal injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein). It is usually infused intravenously once daily, or for the treatment of leishmaniasis on specific days, over a period of 2 hours. If previous doses are tolerated, this medication may be given over a period of 1 hour. The length of your treatment depends on your general health, how you tolerate the medication, and the type of infection you have.
You may experience a reaction while you receive a dose of amphotericin B liposomal complex injection. These reactions usually happen 1 to 3 hours after starting your infusion and are more severe with the first few doses. Your health care provider may prescribe other medications to decrease these side effects. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms while you receive amphotericin B liposomal complex injection: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, chest pain, shortness of breath, breathing problems, or a fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat.
You may receive amphotericin B liposomal injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you will be using amphotericin B liposomal injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems infusing amphotericin B liposomal injection.
If your symptoms do not improve or get worse while receiving amphotericin B liposomal injection, tell your doctor. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish amphotericin B liposomal injection, tell your doctor.
