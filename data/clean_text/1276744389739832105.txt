Why is this medication prescribed?
Co-trimoxazole (a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) is used to treat certain infections that are caused by bacteria. It also is used to treat 'travelers' diarrhea. Co-trimoxazole is in a class of medications called sulfonamides. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.
Antibiotics will not work to kill viruses.
How should this medicine be used?
Co-trimoxazole comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is taken two to four times a day. Your doctor will decide how frequently you will take co-trimoxazole and for how long based on the infection being treated. Take co-trimoxazole at around the same time(s) every day
Take co-trimoxazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with co-trimoxazole. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.
Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
Take co-trimoxazole until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking co-trimoxazole too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

What special dietary instructions should I follow?
