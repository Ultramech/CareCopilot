Why is this medication prescribed?
Beclomethasone nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose (rhinitis) caused by hay fever, other allergies, or vasomotor (nonallergic) rhinitis. It is also used to prevent nasal polyps (swelling of the lining of the nose) after nasal polyp removal surgery. Beclomethasone nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, itchy nose) caused by the common cold. Beclomethasone nasal spray is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.
How should this medicine be used?
Beclomethasone comes as a suspension (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use beclomethasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
An adult should help children younger than 12 years old to use beclomethasone nasal spray. Children younger than 6 years of age should not use this medication.
Beclomethasone nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your mouth or eyes.
Each bottle of beclomethasone nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share beclomethasone nasal spray because this may spread germs.
Beclomethasone nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever or allergies but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve a few days after you first use beclomethasone, but it may take 1 to 2 weeks before you feel the full benefit of beclomethasone. Beclomethasone works best when used regularly. Use beclomethasone on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use beclomethasone nasal spray for 3 weeks. If you are using beclomethasone nasal spray to prevent the recurrence of nasal polyps after surgery, you may have to continue treatment for several weeks as directed by your doctor.
Beclomethasone nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays has been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and throw away the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid.
Before you use beclomethasone nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Follow these steps:
Shake the bottle gently before each use.
Remove the dust cover.
If you are using the pump for the first time or have not used it for a week or more, you must prime it by following steps 4 to 5 below. If you have used the pump in the past week, skip to step 6.
Hold the spray with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom of the bottle resting on your thumb. Point the applicator away from your face.
If you are using the spray for the first time, press down and release the pump six times. If you have used the pump before, but not within the past week or have just cleaned the nozzle, press down and release the spray until you see a fine spray.
Gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils.
Hold one nostril closed with your finger.
Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the nasal applicator tip into your other nostril. Be sure to keep the bottle upright.
Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom resting on your thumb.
Begin to breathe in through your nose.
While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.
Breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.
If your doctor told you to use two sprays in that nostril, repeat steps 6 to 12.
Repeat steps 6 to 13 in the other nostril.
Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and cover it with the dust cover.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
