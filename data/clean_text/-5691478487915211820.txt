IMPORTANT WARNING:
Do not take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, call your doctor immediately. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may harm the fetus.
Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Lisinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.
High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
