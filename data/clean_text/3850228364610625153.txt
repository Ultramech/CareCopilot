Why is this medication prescribed?
Pasireotide injection (Signifor
®
and Signifor LAR
®
) is used to treat Cushing's disease (an abnormal condition that is caused by excess hormones [cortisol]) in adults who cannot be treated with surgery or who did not respond to surgery. Pasireotide injection (Signifor LAR
®
) is also used to decrease the amount of growth hormone (a natural substance) produced by people with acromegaly (condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone, causing enlargement of the hands, feet, and facial features; joint pain; and other symptoms) who cannot be treated with surgery or who did not respond to surgery. Pasireotide injection is in a class of medications called somatostatin agonists. It works by decreasing the amounts of cortisol produced by the body.
