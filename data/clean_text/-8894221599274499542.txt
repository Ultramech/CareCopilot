Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. Elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Cobicistat helps to keep elvitegravir in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect.
Although the combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses. Taking these medications and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of giving the HIV virus to other people.

Take elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF help to control HIV infection but do not cure it.
