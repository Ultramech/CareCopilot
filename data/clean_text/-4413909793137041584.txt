Why is this medication prescribed?
Tenapanor is used to reduce phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis who have not responded to or have not tolerated other therapies. Tenapanor is in a class of medications called sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE3) inhibitors. It works by increasing the movement of food and waste through the stomach and intestines, thereby reducing phosphate absorption.
How should this medicine be used?
Tenapanor comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice daily before the first and last meals of the day. Do not take tenapanor right before a dialysis session. Instead, wait and take tenapanor with the meal following dialysis. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tenapanor exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Continue to take tenapanor even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tenapanor without talking to your doctor.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine
Tenapanor is also sometimes used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?

tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tenapanor, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in tenapanor tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking tenapanor. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
if you are taking sodium polystyrene sulfonate, take it at least 3 hours before or after you take tenapanor.
tell your doctor if you have had or currently have any type of blockage in your stomach or bowels. Your doctor may tell you not to take tenapanor.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had other medical conditions.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking tenapanor, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
