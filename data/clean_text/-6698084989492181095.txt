Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome
Description
Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the body's network of hormone-producing glands (
the endocrine system
) and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely among affected individuals, even within the same family.
People with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome produce abnormally low amounts of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadism), which typically becomes apparent during adolescence. Without hormone replacement therapy, affected individuals do not develop secondary sexual characteristics such as pubic hair, breast growth in women, or a deepening voice in men. Women with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome do not have functional
ovaries
and may instead have undeveloped tissues called streak gonads. The uterus may also be small or absent. Men with this disorder have
testes
that produce little to no
sperm
. As a result, people with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome have difficulty having biological children (a condition called infertility).
Some affected individuals have certain characteristic facial features, including a long,
triangular face
; widely spaced eyes (
hypertelorism
); and a prominent bridge of the nose. People with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome also experience hair loss (alopecia) that begins in childhood and worsens over time. Eyelashes and eyebrows are sparse or absent, and affected men have little or no facial hair. By their mid-twenties, almost all affected individuals develop diabetes mellitus, and they may also have reduced production of
thyroid
hormones (hypothyroidism).
Individuals with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome may have neurological problems. A group of movement abnormalities called dystonias are common in affected individuals, and they generally begin in adolescence or young adulthood. These movement abnormalities can include involuntary tensing of the muscles (muscle contractions) or twisting of specific body parts such as an arm or a leg. Other neurological features can include difficulty with speech (dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), and mild intellectual disabilities.
Changes in the inner
ears
can lead to hearing loss (sensorineural hearing loss) in people with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome. The hearing loss can range from mild to total. This loss usually occurs in adolescence.
In some affected individuals, abnormal deposits of iron in the
brain
have been detected with medical imaging. For this reason, Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome is sometimes classified as part of a group of disorders called neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).
Some researchers classify Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome into two types, depending on the signs and symptoms. People with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome type 1 tend to have more severe neurological problems, and those with type 2 have milder or no neurological problems.
Frequency
Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome is a rare disorder. More than 180 affected individuals, largely from Greater Middle East countries, have been described in the medical literature.
Causes
Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome is caused by variants (also called mutations) in the
DCAF17
gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The protein is found in several organs and tissues in the body, including the brain, skin, and
liver
.
Most of the
DCAF17
gene variants that have been identified in people with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome result in a protein that is abnormally short and breaks down quickly or whose usual function is impaired. The loss of DCAF17 protein function likely accounts for the features of Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, although it is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to hormone abnormalities and the other signs and symptoms. Researchers suggest that the different features of the disorder may be caused by variations in other genes called modifiers; however, these genes have not been identified.

DCAF17
Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
