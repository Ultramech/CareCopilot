Why is this medication prescribed?
Carisoprodol is used with rest, physical therapy, and other measures to relax muscles and relieve pain and discomfort caused by strains, sprains, and other muscle injuries. Carisoprodol is in a class of medications called skeletal muscle relaxants. It works by acting in the brain and nervous system to allow the muscles to relax.
How should this medicine be used?
Carisoprodol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken with or without food three times a day and at bedtime. Do not take this drug for more than 3 weeks without talking to your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take carisoprodol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Carisoprodol can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose or take it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking carisoprodol,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to carisoprodol, meprobamate, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in carisoprodol tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take while taking carisoprodol. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
the following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with carisoprodol: St. John's wort; aspirin; omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegrid). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking carisprodol. Do not start any of these medications while taking carisoprodol without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had porphyria (an inherited blood disease that may cause skin or nervous system problems). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take carisoprodol.
tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures or kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking carisoprodol, call your doctor.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking carisoprodol if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take carisoprodol because it is not as safe or effective as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.
you should know that this drug may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how carisoprodol affects you.
ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking carisoprodol. Alcohol can make the side effects from carisoprodol worse.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
