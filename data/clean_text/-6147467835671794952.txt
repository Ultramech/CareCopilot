Why is this medication prescribed?
Triamcinolone topical is used to treat the itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort of various skin conditions, including psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body and eczema (a skin disease that causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes). It is also used as a dental paste to relieve the discomfort of mouth sores. Triamcinolone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by activating natural substances in the skin to reduce swelling, redness, and itching.
How should this medicine be used?
Triamcinolone comes in ointment, cream, lotion, and aerosol (spray) in various strengths for use on the skin and as a paste for use in the mouth. It usually is applied two to four times a day. For mouth sores, it is applied at bedtime and, if necessary, two or three times daily, preferably after meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use triamcinolone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor.
To use triamcinolone topical, apply the ointment, cream, or lotion sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently.
To use the lotion or aerosol (spray) on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area, and rub it in gently. Protect the area from washing and rubbing until the lotion or spray dries. You may wash your hair as usual but not right after applying the medicine.
To apply an aerosol, shake well and spray on the affected area holding the container about 3 to 6 inches away. Spray for about 2 seconds to cover an area the size of your hand. Take care not to inhale the vapors. If you are spraying near your face, cover your eyes.
To apply the paste, press a small amount on the mouth sore without rubbing until a thin film develops. You may need to use more paste if the mouth sore is large. If the mouth sore does not begin to heal within 7 days, call your doctor.
Triamcinolone aerosol (spray) may catch fire. Stay away from open fire, flames, and do not smoke while you are applying triamcinolone aerosol, and for a short time afterward.
If you are using triamcinolone topical on your face, keep it out of your eyes.
Do not apply other skin preparations or products on the treated area without talking with your doctor.
If you are using triamcinolone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using triamcinolone topical,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to triamcinolone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in triamcinolone topical products. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.

tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using triamcinolone topical, call your doctor.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
