Why is this medication prescribed?
Fosphenytoin injection is used to treat primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly known as a grand mal seizure; seizure that involves the entire body) and to treat and prevent seizures that may begin during or after surgery to the brain or nervous system. Fosphenytoin injection may also be used to control certain type of seizures in people who cannot take oral phenytoin. Fosphenytoin is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Fosphenytoin injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. When fosphenytoin is injected intravenously, it is usually injected slowly. How often you receive fosphenytoin injection and the length of your treatment depends on how your body responds to the medication. Your doctor will tell you how often you will receive fosphenytoin injection.
