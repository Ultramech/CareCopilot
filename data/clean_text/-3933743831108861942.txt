Why is this medication prescribed?
Doxylamine is used in the short-term treatment of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Doxylamine is also used in combination with decongestants and other medications to relieve sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion caused by the common cold. Doxylamine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Doxylamine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.
How should this medicine be used?
Doxylamine comes as a tablet to take by mouth for sleep, and in combination with other medications as a liquid and liquid-filled capsule to treat symptoms of the common cold. When doxylamine is used to reduce difficulty falling asleep, it usually is taken 30 minutes before bedtime. When doxylamine is used to treat cold symptoms, it is usually taken every 4 to 6 hours. Follow the directions on the package label or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take doxylamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor or directed on the package label.
Doxylamine comes alone and in combination with pain relievers, fever reducers, and cough suppressants, If you are choosing a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose.
Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain doxylamine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give nonprescription products that contain doxylamine to children younger than 4 years of age. Ask a doctor before giving these products to children 4 to 12 years of age.
Cough and cold symptoms that get worse or that do not go away may be signs of a more serious condition. If you are taking doxylamine in combination with other medications to treat cough and cold symptoms, call your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if they last longer than 7 days.
If you are taking doxylamine to treat insomnia, you will probably become very sleepy soon after you take the medication and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. Plan to remain asleep for 7 to 8 hours after taking the medication. If you get up too soon after taking doxylamine, you may be drowsy.
Doxylamine should only be used to treat insomnia for a short time. Call your doctor if you feel that you need to take doxylamine for longer than 2 weeks.
If you are using the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring cup or spoon that came with the medication or use a spoon that is made especially for measuring medication.
