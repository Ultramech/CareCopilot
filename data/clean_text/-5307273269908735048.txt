Summary
Before any drug can be sold in the United States, it must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is true whether it's a prescription or an
over-the-counter
drug. The FDA evaluates both the effectiveness and safety of a drug by looking at:
How animal testing and human clinical trials affect the condition the drug is treating
If any
side effects
occur
How it's manufactured
What the labeling says
The FDA also monitors a drug's safety after approval. Health care providers and patients can report drug side effects through the FDA's
MedWatch website
.
For you, drug safety means buying online only from licensed pharmacies located in the United States. It also means knowing how to
take your medicines correctly
.
