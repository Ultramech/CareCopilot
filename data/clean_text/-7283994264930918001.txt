Why is this medication prescribed?
Nystatin is used to treat fungal infections of the inside of the mouth and lining of the stomach and intestines. Nystatin is in a class of antifungal medications called polyenes. It works by stopping the growth of fungi that cause infection.
How should this medicine be used?
Nystatin comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. For the treatment of fungal infections of the lining of the stomach and intestines, nystatin tablets are usually taken three times a day. For the treatment of fungal infections of the mouth, nystatin suspension is usually used four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nystatin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Place half of the dose in each side of the mouth and hold it there as long as possible before swallowing.
Use nystatin as long as instructed by your doctor, even if you feel better. If you stop using nystatin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?

tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using nystatin, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Use the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.
