Why is this medication prescribed?
Aminocaproic acid injection is used to control bleeding that occurs when blood clots are broken down too quickly. This type of bleeding may occur during or after heart or liver surgery; in people who have certain bleeding disorders; in people who have cancer of the prostate (a male reproductive gland), lung, stomach, or cervix (opening of the uterus); and in pregnant women experiencing placental abruption (placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born). Aminocaproic acid injection is also used to control bleeding in the urinary tract (the organs in the body that produce and excrete urine) that may occur after prostate or kidney surgery or in people who have certain types of cancer. Aminocaproic acid injection should not be used to treat bleeding that is not caused by faster than normal clot breakdown, so your doctor may order tests to find the cause of your bleeding before you begin your treatment. Aminocaproic acid injection is in a class of medications called hemostatics.
How should this medicine be used?
Aminocaproic acid injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic or by the patient at home. It is usually injected over about 8 hours as needed to control bleeding. If you are injecting aminocaproic acid at home, use it exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
Aminocaproic acid injection is also sometimes used to treat bleeding in the eye that was caused by an injury. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using aminocaproic acid injection,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to aminocaproic acid or any other medications.
Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving aminocaproic acid injection. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had blood clots or heart, liver or kidney disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using aminocaproic acid injection, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using aminocaproic acid injection.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
If you are using aminocaproic acid at home and you miss a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not inject a double dose to make up for a missed one.

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
If you will be using aminocaproic acid injection at home, store the medication as directed by your health care provider and out of the reach of children. Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication.
