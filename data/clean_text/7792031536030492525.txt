Why is this medication prescribed?
Fremanezumab-vfrm injection is used to help prevent migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that may cause nausea and sensitivity to sound or light). Fremanezumab-vfrm injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the action of a certain natural substance in the body that causes migraine headaches.
How should this medicine be used?
Fremanezumab-vfrm injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe and autoinjection device to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is given either once a month (as 1 injection) or once every 3 months (as 3 separate injections given one right after the other). Use fremanezumab-vfrm injection at around the same day every 1 or 3 month(s), depending on your dose.
Use fremanezumab-vfrm injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
You may be able to inject the medication yourself at home or have a caregiver perform the injections. Ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be performing the injections how to inject the medication.
Remove the syringe or autoinjection device from the refrigerator. Place on a flat surface away from direct sunlight. Do not remove the needle or device cap. Allow it to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes before injecting. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, leaving it in sunlight, or through any other method.
Use each syringe or autoinjection device only once and inject all the solution in the syringe or device. Dispose of used syringes or devices in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.
Inject fremanezumab-vfrm into thigh, upper arm, or stomach area. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, thick, bruised, red, scaly, hard, or has scars or stretch marks.
Always look at fremanezumab-vfrm before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use fremanezumab-vfrm injection, if it is colored, cloudy, or contains flakes or solid particles. Do not shake it.
If your doctor tells you to inject three separate injections one after another, use a different syringe or autoinjection device for each injection. If you use the same body site (upper arm, thigh, or stomach) for the separate injections, make sure that each injection it is not at the exact same spot you used for the other injections.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
