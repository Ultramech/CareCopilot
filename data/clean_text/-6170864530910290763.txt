Your doctor will order a blood test to see if you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of hepatitis B infection during and for several months after your treatment. If necessary, your doctor may give you medication to treat this infection before and during your treatment with the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.

Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is used alone or in combination with ribavirin (Copegus, Rebetol, Ribasphere, others) to treat certain types of chronic hepatitis C (an ongoing viral infection that damages the liver) in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Sofosbuvir is in a class of antiviral medications called nucleotide polymerase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body. Ledipasvir is in a class of antiviral medications called HCV NS5A inhibitors. It works by stopping the virus that causes hepatitis C from spreading inside the body.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir comes as a tablet and pellets to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once daily.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ledipasvir and sofosbuvir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir pellets can be swallowed (without chewing) or they can be taken with food. To prepare a dose of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir pellets with food, sprinkle the entire packet of pellets on one or more spoonfuls of cold or room temperature non-acidic soft food such as pudding, chocolate syrup, mashed potato, or ice cream. Take the entire mixture within 30 minutes of sprinkling the pellets on food. To avoid a bitter aftertaste, do not chew the pellets.
Continue to take ledipasvir and sofosbuvir even if you feel well. The length of your treatment (8 to 24 weeks) depends on your condition, how well you respond to the medication, and whether you experience severe side effects.
