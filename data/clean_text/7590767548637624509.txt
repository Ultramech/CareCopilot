Why is this medication prescribed?
Betamethasone topical is used to treat the itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort of various skin conditions, including psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) and eczema (a skin disease that causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes). Betamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by activating natural substances in the skin to reduce swelling, redness, and itching.
How should this medicine be used?
Betamethasone comes in ointment, cream, lotion, gel, and aerosol (spray) in various strengths for use on the skin and as a foam to apply to the scalp. It is usually applied once or twice daily. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use betamethasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor.
Your skin condition should improve during the first 2 weeks of your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time.
To use betamethasone topical, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, solution, gel, or lotion to cover the affected area of skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently.
To use the foam on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area, and rub it in gently. You may wash your hair as usual but not right after applying the medicine.
Betamethasone foam may catch fire. Stay away from open fire, flames, and do not smoke while you are applying betamethasone foam, and for a short time afterward.
This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let betamethasone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use in the genital and rectal areas and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor.
If you are using betamethasone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.
Do not apply other skin preparations or products on the treated area without talking with your doctor.
Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects.
Call your doctor if the treated area gets worse or if burning, swelling, redness, or oozing of pus develops.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
