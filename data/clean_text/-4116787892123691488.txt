IMPORTANT WARNING:
Desmopressin nasal may cause serious and possibly life-threatening hyponatremia (low level of sodium in your blood). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a low level of sodium in your blood, are thirsty much of the time, drink large amounts of fluids, or if you have syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH; condition in which the body produces too much of a certain natural substance that causes the body to retain water), or kidney disease. Also tell your doctor if you have an infection, a fever, or a stomach or intestinal illness with vomiting or diarrhea. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following during your treatment: headache, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, weight gain, loss of appetite, irritability, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, muscle cramping, seizures, confusion, loss of consciousness, or hallucinations.
Tell your doctor if you are taking a loop diuretic ("water pills") such as bumetanide, furosemide (Lasix), or torsemide; an inhaled steroid such as beclomethasone (Beconase, QNasl, Qvar), budesonide (Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Uceris), fluticasone (Advair, Flonase, Flovent), or mometasone (Asmanex, Nasonex); or an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos). Your doctor will probably tell you not to use desmopressin nasal if you are using or taking one of these medications.
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order tests to monitor your sodium levels before and during your treatment to check your body's response to desmopressin nasal.
Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of using desmopressin nasal.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Desmopressin nasal (DDAVP
®
) is used to control the symptoms of a certain type of diabetes insipidus ('water diabetes'; condition in which the body produces an abnormally large amount of urine). Desmopressinnasal (DDAVP
®
) is also used to control excessive thirst and the passage of an abnormally large amount of urine that may occur after a head injury or after certain types of surgery. Desmopressin nasal (Noctiva
®
) is used to control frequent nighttime urination in adults who awaken at least 2 times per night to urinate. Desmopressin nasal (Stimate
®
) is used to stop some types of bleeding in people with hemophilia (condition in which the blood does not clot normally) and von Willebrand's disease (a bleeding disorder) with certain blood levels. Desmopressin nasal is in a class of medications called antidiuretic hormones. It works by replacing vasopressin, a hormone that is normally produced in the body to help balance the amount of water and salt.
How should this medicine be used?
Desmopressin nasal comes as a liquid that is administered into the nose through a rhinal tube (thin plastic tube that is placed in the nose to administer medication), and as a nasal spray. It is usually used one to three times a day. When desmopressin nasal (Stimate
®
) is used to treat hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease, 1 to 2 spray(s) are given daily. If Stimate
®
is used before surgery, it is usually given 2 hours before the procedure. When desmopressin nasal (Noctiva
®
) is used to treat frequent nighttime urination, one spray is usually given in either the left or right nostril 30 minutes before going to bed. Use desmopressin nasal at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nasal desmopressin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Desmopressin nasal spray (Noctiva) is available in two different strengths. These products cannot be substituted for each other. Each time you have your prescription filled, make sure that you have received the right product. If you think you received the wrong strength, talk to your doctor and pharmacist right away.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of desmopressin nasal and adjust your dose depending on your condition. Follow these directions carefully.
If you will be using the nasal spray, you should check the manufacturer's information to find out how many sprays your bottle contains. Keep track of the number of sprays you use, not including the priming sprays. Discard the bottle after you use the stated number of sprays, even if it still contains some medication, because additional sprays might not contain a full dose of medication. Do not try to transfer the leftover medication to another bottle.
Before you use desmopressin nasal for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the medication. Be sure that you understand how to prepare the bottle before the first use and how to use the spray or rhinal tube. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use this medication.

Call your doctor if you develop a stuffed or runny nose at any time during your treatment.
