IMPORTANT WARNING:
Chlordiazepoxide may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take certain opiate medications for cough such as codeine (in Triacin-C
®
, in Tuzistra
®
XR) or hydrocodone (in Anexsia
®
, in Norco
®
, in Zyfrel
®
) or for pain such as codeine (in Fiorinal
®
), fentanyl (Actiq
®
, Duragesic
®
, Subsy
®
s, others), hydromorphone (Dilaudid
®
, Exalgo
®
), meperidine (Demerol
®
), methadone (Dolophine
®
, Methadose
®
), morphine (Astramorph
®
, Duramorph
®
PF, Kadian
®
), oxycodone (in Oxycet
®
, in Percocet
®
, in Roxicet
®
, others), and tramadol (Conzip
®
, Ultram
®
, in Ultracet
®
). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take the combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
Chlordiazepoxide may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, if you use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with chlordiazepoxide also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Chlordiazepoxide may cause a physical dependence (a condition in which unpleasant physical symptoms occur if a medication is suddenly stopped or taken in smaller doses), especially if you take it for several days to several weeks. Do not stop taking this medication or take fewer doses without talking to your doctor. Stopping the combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium suddenly can worsen your condition and cause withdrawal symptoms that may last for several weeks to more than 12 months. Your doctor probably will decrease your combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium dose gradually. Call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality.
Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium is used along with other medications to treat peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; a condition that causes stomach pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea), and enterocolitis (swelling in the intestines). Chlordiazepoxide is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Clidinium is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. It helps to decrease stomach spasms and cramps.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium comes as a capsule to be taken by mouth. It usually is taken three or four times a day, before meals and at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take chlordiazepoxide and clidinium exactly as directed.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with chlordiazepoxide and clidinium and each time you fill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
