Why is this medication prescribed?
Diphenhydramine topical is used to relieve itching from insect bites, sunburns, bee stings, poison ivy, poison oak, and minor skin irritation. Diphenhydramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.
How should this medicine be used?
Diphenhydramine topical comes in cream, lotion, gel, and spray to be applied to the skin. It is used up to three or four times a day. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms worsen, continue for more than 7 days, or if they get better, but reoccur within a few days.
Use diphenhydramine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed by your doctor.
Thoroughly clean the affected area, allow it to dry, and then apply the medication. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. Do not use on large areas of your body. You should wash your hands after applying the medication.
Do not use it on a child younger than 2 years of age unless directed to do so by a doctor. Talk to your doctor before using this medication to treat chicken pox or measles.
