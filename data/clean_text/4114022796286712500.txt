AATD is an inherited condition in which the body does not make enough of a protein (alpha-1 antitrypsin) needed to protect the lungs from smoke, dust, or pollution. Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor is in a class of medications called blood derivatives. It works by increasing the levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein in your blood and lungs.
How should this medicine be used?
Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor comes as a solution (liquid) or as a powder to be mixed with a solution (liquid) to give intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given once a week by a healthcare provider.

Your doctor or pharmacist will show you or the person who will be performing the injections how to prepare and infuse alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor.
