Why is this medication prescribed?
Dimethyl fumarate is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; nerve symptom episodes that last at least 24 hours), relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or secondary progressive forms (course of disease where relapses occur more often). Dimethyl fumarate is in a class of medications called Nrf2 activators. It works by decreasing inflammation and preventing nerve damage that may cause symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
How should this medicine be used?
Dimethyl fumarate comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take dimethyl fumarate at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dimethyl fumarate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Dimethyl fumarate may be taken with or without food. However, if you take dimethyl fumarate with food or with a non-enteric coated aspirin (325 mg or less) 30 minutes before taking dimethyl fumarate, there is less of a chance that you will experience flushing during your treatment.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. Do not open the capsules or sprinkle the contents on food.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of dimethyl fumarate and increase your dose after 7 days.
Dimethyl fumarate may help to control multiple sclerosis, but will not cure it. Continue to take dimethyl fumarate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking dimethyl fumarate without talking to your doctor.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking dimethyl fumarate,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in dimethyl fumarate capsules. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's patient information for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking dimethyl fumarate. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have any type of infection, including infections that come and go and chronic infections that do not go away, or if you have or have ever had chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles; a rash that can occur in people who have had chickenpox in the past); a low white blood cell count; or liver problems.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking dimethyl fumarate, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
