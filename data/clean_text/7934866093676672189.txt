Why is this medication prescribed?
Hydrocortisone injection is used to treat symptoms of low corticosteroid levels (lack of certain substances that are usually produced by the body and are needed for normal body functioning). It is also used to treat severe allergic reactions. Hydrocortisone injection is used in the management of multiple sclerosis (a disease in which the nerves do not function properly), lupus (a disease in which the body attacks many of its own organs), gastrointestinal disease, and certain types of arthritis. Hydrocortisone injection is also used to treat certain conditions that affect the blood, skin, eyes, nervous system, thyroid, kidneys, and lungs. Hydrocortisone injection is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works to treat people with low levels of corticosteroids by replacing steroids that are normally produced naturally by the body. It also works to treat other conditions by reducing swelling and redness and by changing the way the immune system works.
How should this medicine be used?
Hydrocortisone injection comes as powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) or intravenously (into a vein). Your dosing schedule will depend on your condition and on how you respond to treatment.
You may receive hydrocortisone injection in a hospital or medical facility, or you may be given the medication to use at home. If you will be using hydrocortisone injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to inject the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems using hydrocortisone injection.
Your doctor may change your dose of hydrocortisone injection during your treatment to be sure that you are always using the lowest dose that works for you. Your doctor may also need to change your dose if you experience unusual stress on your body such as surgery, illness, or infection. Tell your doctor if your symptoms improve or get worse or if you get sick or have any changes in your health during your treatment.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before receiving hydrocortisone injection,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to hydrocortisone, any other medications, benzyl alcohol, or any of the ingredients in hydrocortisone injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving hydrocortisone injection. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
the following nonprescription products may interact with hydrocortisone injection: aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start receiving hydrocortisone injection. Do not start any of these medications while receiving hydrocortisone injection without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin or nails). Your doctor will probably tell you not to use hydrocortisone injection. Also, tell your doctor if you have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; an ongoing condition that may cause easy bruising or bleeding due to an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood). Your doctor probably will not give you hydrocortisone intramuscularly, if you have ITP.

Also tell your doctor if you have any type of untreated bacterial, parasitic, or viral infection anywhere in your body or a herpes eye infection (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface).
