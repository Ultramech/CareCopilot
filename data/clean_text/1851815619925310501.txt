Why is this medication prescribed?
Penicillin V potassium is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections, scarlet fever, and ear, skin, gum, mouth, and throat infections. It also is used to prevent rheumatic fever (a serious condition that may develop after a strep throat or scarlet fever infection and may cause swelling of the heart valves and other symptoms) from coming back. Penicillin V potassium is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria.
Antibiotics such as penicillin V potassium will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Penicillin V potassium comes as a tablet and as an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. For the treatment of infections, it is usually taken every 6 hours (four times a day) or every 8 hours (three times a day). For the prevention of rheumatic fever, it is usually taken twice a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection that you have. Take penicillin V potassium at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take penicillin V potassium exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Shake the oral solution well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
Take penicillin V potassium until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking penicillin V potassium without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking penicillin V potassium too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Other uses for this medicine
Penicillin V potassium is also sometimes used to treat certain anthrax infections of the skin. It also sometimes used with other medications to treat diphtheria (a serious sickness that causes problems breathing and other symptoms, uncommon in developed countries).
Penicillin V potassium is also sometimes used to prevent a heart valve infection in certain patients who have a heart condition and require a dental or upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, voice box) procedure.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?

tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you currently have nausea or vomiting. Also, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had allergies, asthma, hay fever, or kidney disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking penicillin V potassium, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
