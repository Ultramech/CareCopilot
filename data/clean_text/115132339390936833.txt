IMPORTANT WARNING:
Accidental overdose of products containing iron is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under the age of 6. Keep this product out of the reach of children. In case of an accidental overdose, call your doctor or a poison control center immediately.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Iron (as ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, or ferrous sulfate) is used to treat or prevent anemia (a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells) when the amount of iron taken in from your diet is not enough. Iron is a mineral that is available as a dietary supplement. It works by providing iron to help the body to produce red blood cells.
How should this medicine be used?
Iron supplements (as ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous sulfate) come as regular, film-coated, and extended-release (long acting) tablets; capsules, and an oral liquid (drops and elixir) to take by mouth. Iron is usually taken with food or immediately after a meal once daily or as directed by your doctor. Take iron at around the same time(s) every day.
Take iron supplements exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Iron supplements are available alone and in combination with vitamins and certain medications. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains iron, you should be careful not to take any other supplements or medications that also contain iron.
Swallow the tablets, film-coated tablets, and extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Mix the elixir with water or fruit juice to avoid possible teeth staining; do not mix with milk or wine-based solutions.
Iron drops come with a special dropper for measuring the dose. Ask your pharmacist or doctor to show you how to use it. The drops may be placed directly in the mouth or mixed with water, breastmilk, cereal, formula, or fruit juice. Direct the dropper gently into mouth towards inner cheek; a small amount will remain in the tip. If you are giving iron drops to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give iron products that are made for adults to children.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking an iron supplement,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
if you are taking certain antibiotics such as doxycycline, minocycline (Dynacin®, Minolira®, Solodyn®, Ximino®), and tetracycline, take them 2 hours before or 2 hours after iron supplements.
tell your doctor if you have a certain type of blood disease such as hemolytic anemia (a condition with an abnormally low number of red blood cells). Your doctor may probably tell you not to take an iron supplement.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking an iron supplement, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Iron supplements may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
constipation

) or by phone (

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
