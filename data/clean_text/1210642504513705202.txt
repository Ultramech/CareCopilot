Why is this medication prescribed?
Prescription lansoprazole is used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and possible injury of the esophagus (the tube between the throat and stomach) in adults and children 1 year of age and older. Prescription lansoprazole is used to treat the damage from GERD in adults and children 1 year of age and older. Prescription lansoprazole is used to allow the esophagus to heal and prevent further damage to the esophagus in adults with GERD. Prescription lansoprazole is also used to treat ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine), to prevent more ulcers from developing in adults whose ulcers have already healed, and to decrease the risk that adults who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will develop ulcers. Prescription lansoprazole is also used to treat conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Prescription lansoprazole is also used in combination with other medications to treat and prevent stomach ulcers caused by a certain type of bacteria (
H. pylori
) in adults. Nonprescription (over-the-counter) lansoprazole is used to treat frequent heartburn (heartburn that occurs two or more days per week) in adults. Lansoprazole is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.
How should this medicine be used?
Prescription lansoprazole comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule and as a delayed-release orally disintegrating (dissolving) tablet to take by mouth. Nonprescription lansoprazole comes as a delayed-release capsule to take by mouth. Prescription lansoprazole is usually taken once a day, before a meal. When taken in combination with other medications to eliminate
H. pylori
, prescription lansoprazole is taken twice a day (every 12 hours) or three times a day (every 8 hours), before a meal, for 10 to 14 days. Nonprescription lansoprazole is usually taken once a day, in the morning before eating for 14 days. If needed, additional 14-day treatments may be repeated, not more often than once every 4 months. Take lansoprazole at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lansoprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor or stated on the package. Tell your doctor if you have taken nonprescription lansoprazole for a longer period of time than stated on the package.
Swallow the prescription capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you have difficulty swallowing capsules, you may open the capsule, sprinkle the granules on 1 tablespoon of applesauce, Ensure
®
pudding, cottage cheese, yogurt, or strained pears and swallow the mixture immediately without chewing. You can also open a capsule and pour the contents into 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of orange juice, apple juice or tomato juice, mix briefly, and swallow immediately. After you swallow the mixture, rinse the glass with some additional juice and drink immediately. Then rinse the glass with juice at least two more times and drink the juice to be sure that you wash all the medication out of the glass.
Swallow the nonprescription capsules whole with a glass of water. Do not split, chew, or crush them.
Do not break, cut or chew the orally disintegrating tablets. Place a tablet on your tongue and wait up to one minute for it to dissolve. After the tablet dissolves, swallow it with or without water. If you cannot swallow the tablet, you may place it in an oral syringe, draw up 4 mL of water for a 15 mg tablet or 10 mL of water for a 30-mg tablet, shake the syringe gently to dissolve the tablet, and squirt the contents into your mouth immediately. Then draw an additional 2 mL of water into the syringe, shake gently, and squirt that water into your mouth. Do not swallow the mixture more than 15 minutes after you dissolve the tablet.
The capsule contents and orally disintegrating tablets can both be given through a feeding tube. If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor how you should take the medication. Follow these directions carefully.
Do not take nonprescription lansoprazole for immediate relief of heartburn symptoms. It may take 1 to 4 days for you to feel the full benefit of the medication. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 14 days or if your symptoms return sooner than 4 months after you finish your treatment. Do not take nonprescription lansoprazole for longer than 14 days or treat yourself with lansoprazole more often than once every 4 months without talking to your doctor.
Continue to take lansoprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prescription lansoprazole without talking to your doctor. If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.

People who take proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole may be more likely to fracture their wrists, hips, or spine than people who do not take one of these medications. People who take proton pump inhibitors may also develop fundic gland polyps (a type of growth on the stomach lining).
