Why is this medication prescribed?
Topical miconazole is used to treat tinea corporis(ringworm; fungal skin infection that causes a red scaly rash on different parts of the body), tinea cruris (jock itch; fungal infection of the skin in the groin or buttocks), and tinea pedis (athlete's foot; fungal infection of the skin on the feet and between the toes). Miconazole is in a class of antifungal medications called imidazoles. It works by stopping the growth of fungi that cause infection.
Not all products should be used to treat all of these conditions. Please read the label for each product to select the one to treat your condition.
How should this medicine be used?
Topical miconazole comes as a spray, spray powder, cream, powder, and tincture to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day (morning and night). Follow the directions on the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use miconazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package or as directed by your doctor.
Topical miconazole is only for use on the skin. Do not let miconazole get into your eyes or mouth, and do not swallow the medication. Miconazole does not work on the scalp or nails.
If you are using miconazole to treat jock itch, your symptoms should improve over 2 weeks of treatment. If you are using miconazole to treat athlete's foot or ringworm, your symptoms should improve over 4 weeks of treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time or if your symptoms get worse at any time during your treatment.
Miconazole spray, spray powder, and tincture may catch fire. Do not use these products near heat or an open flame, such as a cigarette.
To use topical miconazole, wash the affected area and dry thoroughly. If you are using the spray or spray powder, shake the can well. Then apply a small amount of spray, spray powder, cream, powder, or tincture to cover the affected area of skin with a thin layer.
If you are treating athlete's foot, pay special attention to the spaces between the toes when applying miconazole. Also, be sure to wear well-fitting shoes that allow for air circulation, and change shoes and socks at least once a day.
If you are treating jock itch with the powder, do not apply the powder to any open wounds.
Other uses for this medicine
Topical miconazole may be used to treat tinea versicolor (fungal infection of the skin that causes brown or light colored spots on the chest, back, arms, legs, or neck) or yeast infections of the skin. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using topical miconazole,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to miconazole, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in miconazole spray, spray powder, cream, powder, or tincture. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using miconazole, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double amount to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Miconazole may cause side effects. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop using miconazole and call your doctor:
irritation or burning in the place where you applied the medication
rash
Miconazole may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (

) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
