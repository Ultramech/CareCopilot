Why is this medication prescribed?
Loratadine is used to temporarily relieve runny nose; sneezing; and redness, itching, and tearing of the eyes caused by allergies. Loratadine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.
How should this medicine be used?
Loratadine comes as a liquid, a tablet, a chewable tablet, a capsule, and a rapidly disintegrating (dissolving) tablet to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food.
Take loratadine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed on the package label or recommended by your doctor.
If you are taking the rapidly disintegrating tablet, follow the package directions to remove the tablet from the blister package to avoid breaking the tablet. Do not try to push the tablet through the foil. After you remove the tablet from the blister package, immediately place it on your tongue and close your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with or without water.
Do not use this medication if the safety seal is open or torn.
Other uses for this medicine
Loratadine has also been used to treat itching and redness caused by hives. This medication may be recommended for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking loratadine,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking loratadine, call your doctor.
if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that the chewable tablets may contain aspartame that forms phenylalanine.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
