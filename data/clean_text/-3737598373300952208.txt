IMPORTANT WARNING:
Penicillin G benzathine injection should never be given intravenously (into a vein) because this may cause serious or life-threatening side effects or death.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Penicillin G benzathine injection is used to treat and prevent certain infections caused by bacteria. Penicillin G benzathine injection is in a class of antibiotics called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections.
Antibiotics such as penicillin G benzathine injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Penicillin G benzathine injection comes as a suspension (liquid) in a prefilled syringe to inject into the muscles of the buttocks or thigh by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. Penicillin G benzathine injection may be given as a single dose. When used to treat or prevent certain serious infections, additional doses may be given at least 7 days apart. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how many doses you will need or when you will receive them.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with penicillin G benzathine injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
If your doctor has told you that you will need additional doses of penicillin G benzathine injection, make sure to keep all appointments to receive your doses on schedule even if you are feeling better. If you stop using penicillin G benzathine injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
