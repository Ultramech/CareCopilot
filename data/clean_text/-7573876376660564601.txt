Why is this medication prescribed?
Darunavir is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Darunavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood.
Although darunavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses. Taking these medications and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of giving the HIV virus to other people.
How should this medicine be used?
Darunavir comes as a tablet and oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. Take once or twice a day. Take darunavir at around the same time(s) every day.
Take darunavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
You will take other medications for HIV while you are taking darunavir. Your doctor will tell you whether these medications should be taken at the same time as darunavir, or several hours before or after you take darunavir and if you should take them with or without food. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the times you should take your medications.
Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Shake the suspension well right before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the oral dosing syringe that came with the medication to withdraw the correct amount of suspension from the bottle. You can swallow the suspension directly from the syringe. Wash the syringe with water and allow it to dry thoroughly after use.
Darunavir controls HIV but does not cure it. Darunavir also does not treat HIV infection alone. It is important that all of the medications prescribed by your doctor to treat HIV infection are taken together so that the medications will continue to work to control the infection. Continue to take darunavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking darunavir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking darunavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine
Darunavir is also sometimes used to prevent infection in healthcare workers or other people who were accidentally exposed to HIV.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking darunavir,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.

you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at any time during your treatment with darunavir, be sure to tell your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?

What should I do if I forget a dose?
