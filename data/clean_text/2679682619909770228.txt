Why is this medication prescribed?
Psyllium, a bulk-forming laxative, is used to treat constipation. It absorbs liquid in the intestines, swells, and forms a bulky stool, which is easy to pass.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
How should this medicine be used?
Psyllium comes as a powder, granules, capsule, liquid, and wafer to take by mouth. It usually is taken one to three times daily. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take psyllium exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
The powder and granules must be mixed with 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of a pleasant tasting liquid, such as fruit juice, right before use. Chew wafers thoroughly. For psyllium to work properly and to prevent side effects, you must drink at least 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of liquid when you take it.
Do not take psyllium for longer than 1 week unless your doctor tells you to.
Other uses for this medicine
Your doctor also may prescribe psyllium to treat diarrhea or high cholesterol. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this drug for your condition.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking psyllium,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to psyllium or any other drugs.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking psyllium. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
do not take digoxin (Lanoxin), salicylates (aspirin), or nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin, Furadantin, Macrobid) within 3 hours of taking psyllium.
the following nonprescription product may interact with pysillium: aspirin. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking this medication before you start taking psyllium. Do not start this medication while taking psyllium without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes mellitus, heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, rectal bleeding, intestinal blockage, or difficulty swallowing.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking psyllium, call your doctor.
tell your pharmacist or doctor if you are on a low-sugar or low-sodium diet.
be careful not to breathe in psyllium powder when mixing a dose. It can cause allergic reactions when accidentally inhaled.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
To prevent constipation, drink plenty of fluids, exercise regularly, and eat a high-fiber diet, including whole-grain (e.g., bran) cereals, fruits, and vegetables.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
If you are taking scheduled doses of psyllium, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

Psyllium may cause side effects. If you have any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:
