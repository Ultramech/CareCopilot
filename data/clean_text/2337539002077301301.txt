IMPORTANT WARNING:
Oxycodone combination products may be habit forming. Do not take more or less of it, take it more often, stop taking it suddenly, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Oxycodone may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. If you have experienced any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.
Oxycodone combination products may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Keep oxycodone combination products in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose.
Taking certain medications, drinking alcohol, or using street drugs with an oxycodone combination product may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change your medications or change your dose and will monitor you carefully.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take an oxycodone combination product regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide when you begin treatment with an oxycodone combination product and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
).
Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking oxycodone combination products.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Oxycodone is available in combination with other ingredients. Oxycodone combination products are used to relieve severe pain in people whose symptoms cannot be controlled by other pain medications. Oxycodone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. Oxycodone relieves pain by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.
You will take oxycodone in combination with at least one other medication, but this monograph only provides information about oxycodone. Be sure to read information about the other ingredient(s) in the oxycodone product you are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.
How should this medicine be used?
Oxycodone combination products come as a tablet and solution to take by mouth. Take every 6 hours as needed for pain.
Use an oral syringe or dosing cup (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of oxycodone combination product solution. Do not use a household spoon or cup. Ask your pharmacist for a measuring device if one is not included with your medication.
Your doctor may adjust your dose of oxycodone during your treatment, depending on how well your pain is controlled and on the side effects that you experience. Tell your doctor if you feel that your pain is not controlled or if your pain increases, becomes worse, or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain during your treatment with an oxycodone combination product. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You may receive a dangerous overdose if you take more medication or take your medication more often than prescribed by your doctor.
While taking oxycodone combination products, you should talk to your doctor about having a rescue medication called naloxone or nalmefene readily available at all times (e.g., home, office). Rescue medications are used to reverse the life-threatening effects of an overdose and are available over the counter (non-prescription) or with a prescription. Make sure that you and your family members, caregivers, or the people who spend time with you know how to recognize an overdose, how to use naloxone or nalmefene, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. If symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. If your symptoms return within a few minutes, the person should give you another dose of the rescue medication. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.
If you have been taking an oxycodone combination product regularly, do not stop taking it or rapidly decrease the dose without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking an oxycodone combination product, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, muscle pain, widened pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes), irritability, anxiety, back or joint pain, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, fast breathing, or fast heartbeat. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.
