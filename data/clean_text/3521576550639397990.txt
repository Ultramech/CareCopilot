Rheumatoid arthritis
Description
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that causes chronic inflammation that primarily affects the
joints
. The most common signs and symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. This condition frequently affects the hands and feet, although the shoulders, hips, spine, and knees may become involved in the later stages of the disease. Joints are typically affected in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if joints in the hand are affected, both hands tend to be involved. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have trouble with tasks such as opening jars, turning doorknobs, or fastening buttons. Joint pain and stiffness tend to be worse after waking up in the morning or after a long rest.
Rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation in other tissues and organs, including the eyes, skin, heart, and blood vessels. Affected individuals may also have inflammation in the lungs, which is known as interstitial lung disease.
Additional signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can include a loss of energy, a low fever, weight loss, and a shortage of red blood cells (
anemia
). Some affected individuals develop rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue that can grow under the skin and elsewhere in the body.
Most people who have rheumatoid arthritis are 55 years old and older, although it can affect adults of any age. The signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually appear in mid to late adulthood. Many affected people have recurrent episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions). In severe cases, affected individuals have continuous health problems related to the disease for many years. The abnormal inflammation
can lead to severe joint damage
, which limits movement and can cause significant disability.
Frequency
The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 percent in Western Europe and North America; the condition is less common in Asia and Africa. Rheumatoid arthritis is two to three times more common in women than in men, which may be related to hormonal factors.
Causes
Rheumatoid arthritis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown. It is estimated that 50 to 60 percent of the risk of this disease is due to genetic factors.
Rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system triggers abnormal inflammation in the membrane that lines the joints (the synovium). When the synovium is inflamed, it causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joint. The immune system may be malfunctioning for years before the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis appear. In severe cases, the inflammation also affects the bone, cartilage, and other tissues within the joint, causing more serious damage. Abnormal immune reactions also lead to the features of rheumatoid arthritis that affect other parts of the body.
Variations in more than 150 genes have been studied as risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis. Most of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in immune system function. The most significant genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis are variations in
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes
, especially the
HLA-DRB1
gene. The proteins produced from HLA genes help the immune system distinguish between the body's own proteins and the proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). However, in people at risk for rheumatoid arthritis, changes in HLA genes, including
HLA-DRB1
, lead to the production of HLA proteins with altered shapes. As a result, these proteins are more likely to attach (bind) to the body's own proteins, which activates the immune system. Changes in other genes appear to have a smaller impact on a person's overall risk of developing the condition.
Nongenetic factors are also believed to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis. These factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. Potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), a higher body weight, occupational exposure to certain kinds of dust or fibers, and viral or bacterial infections. Infections and inflammation within the mouth, including the gums (gingivitis) and other tissue around the teeth (periodontitis), seem to be associated with increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis. Long-term smoking is a well-established risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis; smoking is also associated with more severe signs and symptoms in people who have the disease.

Inheritance
The inheritance pattern of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. However, about 50 percent of affected individuals have a close relative with rheumatoid arthritis or another autoimmune disease.
