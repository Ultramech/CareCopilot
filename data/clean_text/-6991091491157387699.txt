Why is this medication prescribed?
Topical clindamycin is used to treat acne. Clindamycin is in a class of medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of bacteria that cause acne and by decreasing swelling.
How should this medicine be used?
Topical clindamycin comes as a foam, a gel, a solution (liquid), a lotion, and a pledget (swab) to apply to the skin. The foam and one brand of the gel (Clindagel
®
) are usually applied once a day. The solution, lotion, pledgets, and most brands of gel are applied twice a day. Apply topical clindamycin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use topical clindamycin exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Topical clindamycin is only for use on the skin. Do not swallow the medication, and do not get the medication in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina. If you do get the medication in your eyes, nose, or mouth, or on broken skin, rinse it out with plenty of cool water.
Your medication will probably come with directions for use. Read these directions and follow them carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to apply topical clindamycin.
Shake the lotion well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
The pledgets are for one-time use only. Do not remove a pledget from its foil pouch until you are ready to use it. Dispose of each pledget after you have used it one time.
The foam may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying the foam and for a short time afterward.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using topical clindamycin,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to clindamycin, lincomycin (Lincocin), or any other medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using topical clindamycin. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; condition in which all or part of the lining of the intestine is swollen, irritated, or has sores) or severe diarrhea caused by an antibiotic. Your doctor may tell you not to use topical clindamycin.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma, eczema (sensitive skin that often becomes itchy or irritated) or allergies.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using topical clindamycin, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using topical clindamycin.
you should know that abrasive or medicated soaps and skin products that contain alcohol may make the side effects of topical clindamycin worse. Talk to your doctor about the skin care products you plan to use during your treatment with topical clindamycin.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply extra medication to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?

Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately:

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
