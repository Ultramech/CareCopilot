Why is this medication prescribed?
Halcinonide topical is used to treat the itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort of various skin conditions, including psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) and eczema (a skin disease that causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes). Halcinonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by activating natural substances in the skin to reduce swelling, redness, and itching.
How should this medicine be used?
Halcinonide comes in an ointment and cream to apply to the skin. It is usually applied two or three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use halcinonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor.
To use halcinonide topical, apply a small amount of ointment or cream to cover the affected area of skin with a thin film and rub it in gently.
This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let halcinonide topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use in the genital or rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor.
If you are using halcinonide on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.
Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using halcinonide topical,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to halcinonide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in halcinonide topical products. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take..
tell your doctor if you have an infection or any other skin problems or have or have ever had diabetes or Cushing's syndrome (an abnormal condition that is caused by excess hormones [corticosteroids]).
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using halcinonide, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using halcinonide topical.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Halcinonide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
burning, itching, irritation, redness, drying, or cracking of the skin
acne
changes in skin color
tiny red bumps or rash around the mouth
unwanted hair growth

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:
