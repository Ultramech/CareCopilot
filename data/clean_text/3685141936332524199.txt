Why is this medication prescribed?
Sitagliptin is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Sitagliptin is in a class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances that lower blood sugar when it is high. Sitagliptin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).
Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.
How should this medicine be used?
Sitagliptin comes as a tablet and as an oral solution to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food. Take sitagliptin at around the same time every day.
Take sitagliptin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Use an oral syringe or dosing cup (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of sitagliptan oral solution. Ask your pharmacist for an oral syringe or dosing cup if one is not included with your medication. Do not use a household teaspoon to measure the oral solution.
Sitagliptin helps to control high blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to take sitagliptin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sitagliptin without talking to your doctor.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

What special dietary instructions should I follow?

What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests before and during your treatment with sitagliptin. Your blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be checked regularly to determine your response to sitagliptin. Your doctor will also tell you how to check your response to sitagliptin by measuring your blood or urine sugar levels at home. Follow these instructions carefully.
Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.
Keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.
