Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of ergotamine and caffeine is used to prevent and treat migraine headaches. Ergotamine is in a class of medications called ergot alkaloids. It works together with caffeine by preventing blood vessels in the head from expanding and causing headaches.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of ergotamine and caffeine comes as a tablet to take by mouth and as a suppository to insert rectally. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ergotamine and caffeine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
To use the tablets, follow these steps:
Take two tablets at the first sign of a migraine.
Lie down and relax in a quiet, dark room for at least 2 hours.
If the headache pain does not stop within 30 minutes, take one or two more tablets.
Take one or two tablets every 30 minutes until the headache pain stops or you have taken six tablets.
If the headache pain continues after you have taken six tablets, call your doctor. Do not take more than six tablets for one headache unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so.
Do not take more than six tablets in 24 hours or 10 tablets in 1 week. If you need more, call your doctor.
To use the suppositories, follow these steps:
If the suppository feels soft, place it in ice cold water (before removing foil wrapper) until it hardens.
Remove the wrapper and dip the tip of the suppository in water.
Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (A left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee.)
Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) in children and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. Hold it in place for a few moments.
Wash your hands thoroughly; then lie down and relax in a dark, quiet room for at least 2 hours.
If the headache pain does not stop within 1 hour, insert another suppository.
If the headache pain continues after you have inserted two suppositories, call your doctor. Do not use more than two suppositories for one headache unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so.
Do not use more than five suppositories in 1 week. If you need more, call your doctor.
