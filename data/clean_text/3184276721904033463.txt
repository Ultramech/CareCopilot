Why is this medication prescribed?
Meprobamate is used to treat anxiety disorders or for short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Meprobamate is in a class of medications called tranquilizers. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow for relaxation.
How should this medicine be used?
Meprobamate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken 2 to 3 times a day in children and 3 to 4 times a day in adults. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take meprobamate exactly as directed.
Meprobamate can be habit-forming, do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer period than your doctor tells you to. Do not stop taking this medication without talking to your doctor, especially if you have been taking it for a long time. Your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking meprobamate,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to meprobamate, carisoprodol, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in meprobamate tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking meprobamate. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had porphyria (condition in which certain natural substances build up in the body and may cause stomach pain, changes in thinking and behavior, and other symptoms). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take meprobamate.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease, a history of alcohol or drug abuse, or epilepsy. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had thoughts of harming or killing yourself or trying to do so.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking meprobamate, call your doctor immediately. Meprobamate may harm the fetus.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking meprobamate if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take meprobamate because it is not as safe as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking meprobamate.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol during your treatment with meprobamate. Alcohol can make the side effects of meprobamate worse.

What should I do if I forget a dose?
