Why is this medication prescribed?
Vitamin A is used as a dietary supplement when the amount of vitamin A in the diet is not enough. People most at risk for vitamin A deficiency are those with a limited variety of food in their diet and in those with cystic fibrosis (an inborn disease that causes problems with breathing, digestion, and reproduction) and malabsorption problems (problems absorbing food). Vitamin A is used to prevent and treat xerophthalmia (unable to see in low light) and night blindness. Vitamin A is in a class of medications called an antioxidant. It is needed by the body to help with vision, reproduction, cell growth, and to support the immune system. It works to protect your cells against free radicals and to support cell growth and function.
How should this medicine be used?
Vitamin A comes as a capsule, gel capsule, and liquid drops to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day or as directed by your doctor. Vitamin A is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe it to treat certain conditions. Follow the directions on the package or on your product label or doctor's instructions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take vitamin A exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than recommended by your doctor.
Vitamin A supplements are available alone and in combination with other vitamins.

What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.

Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
