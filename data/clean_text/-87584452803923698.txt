Why is this medication prescribed?
Brompheniramine relieves red, irritated, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; and runny nose caused by allergies, hay fever, and the common cold. Brompheniramine helps control symptoms, but does not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Brompheniramine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Brompheniramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.
How should this medicine be used?
Brompheniramine comes in combination with other cough and cold medications as a chewable tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a liquid to be taken by mouth. The chewable tablet and liquid are usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed. The extended-release tablets and capsules are usually taken every 8 or 12 hours as needed. Follow the directions on the package label or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take brompheniramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.
Brompheniramine comes in combination with other cough and cold medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before taking two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.
Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain brompheniramine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 6 years of age. If you give these products to children 6-11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.
If you are giving a product that contains brompheniramine to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give brompheniramine products that are made for adults to children.
Before you give a brompheniramine product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.
If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication.
If you are taking the extended-release tablets or capsules swallow them whole; do not crush, break, or chew them.
Stop taking brompheniramine and call your doctor if your symptoms last longer than 7 days or if you have a fever.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking brompheniramine,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to brompheniramine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in brompheniramine preparations. Check the package label for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking brompheniramine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.

tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking brompheniramine, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking brompheniramine.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking brompheniramine. Alcohol can make the side effects of brompheniramine worse.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking brompheniramine if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take brompheniramine because it is not as safe or effective as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Brompheniramine is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take brompheniramine regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Brompheniramine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
drowsiness
dry mouth, nose, and throat
nausea
headache
chest congestion
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:
