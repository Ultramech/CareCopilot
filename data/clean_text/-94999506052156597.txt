Why is this medication prescribed?
Diphenoxylate is used along with other treatments such as fluid and electrolyte replacement for the treatment of diarrhea. Diphenoxylate should not be given to children younger than 2 years of age. Diphenoxylate is in a class of medications called antidiarrheal agents. It works by decreasing activity of the bowel.
How should this medicine be used?
Diphenoxylate comes as a tablet and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed up to 4 times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take diphenoxylate exactly as directed. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
The oral solution comes in a container with a special dropper for measuring the dose. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about how to measure a dose.
Your diarrhea symptoms should improve within 48 hours of treatment with diphenoxylate. Your doctor may tell you to decrease your dose as your symptoms improve. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse within 10 days of treatment, call your doctor and stop taking diphenoxylate.
Diphenoxylate can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer period of time than your doctor tells you to. Atropine has been added to diphenoxylate tablets to cause unpleasant effects if this medication is taken in higher doses than recommended.
