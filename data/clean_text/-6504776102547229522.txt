Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome
Description
Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome is a rare disorder that greatly increases the risk of developing different types of cancer throughout a person's lifetime. Affected individuals often develop their first cancer in childhood. The cancers that most commonly occur in people with CMMRD are cancers of the
colon
and rectum (collectively referred to as colorectal cancer), blood (leukemia or lymphoma), and brain.
Approximately 50 percent of people with CMMRD will develop cancer by age 10, and 90 percent will develop cancer by age 18. Brain cancers, leukemias, and lymphomas tend to occur at a younger age than colorectal cancer in affected individuals. Nearly all people with CMMRD will develop a second cancer if they survive the first cancer.
People with CMMRD often develop multiple abnormal growths (polyps) on the lining of the colon. If these polyps are not removed, they may become cancerous over time.
Brain cancers in people with CMMRD are often high-grade gliomas or glioblastomas, which are tumors that are made up of cells called glial cells.
The most common blood cancers in people with CMMRD are
non-Hodgkin lymphomas,
such as lymphoblastic lymphoma. These cancers primarily affect white blood cells known as T cells.
Other cancers that can occur in people who have CMMRD include cancers of
the small intestine
,
urinary tract
, or lining of the uterus. Cancers of the connective tissue and bone (sarcomas) may also develop.
Some affected individuals have patches of skin that are unusually light in color (hypopigmented). Many people with CMMRD develop features similar to those seen in people with a condition called
neurofibromatosis type 1
. These features include changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), which are characterized by multiple flat patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area (
café-au-lait spots
). Because of these shared features, CMMRD is sometimes initially misdiagnosed as neurofibromatosis type 1.
Many people with CMMRD also develop a noncancerous (benign) feature called developmental venous anomaly, which is a rearrangement of the small veins in the brain. This feature can only be seen with medical imaging.
Due to the young age at which people with CMMRD develop cancer, the lifespan of affected individuals is typically shortened, with many people surviving only into adolescence or early adulthood.
Frequency
CMMRD is a rare disorder. Only a few hundred affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The incidence of CMMRD is estimated to be about 1 in 1,000,000 newborns. The incidence is likely higher among people whose parents are related to one another.
Causes
Genetic changes that cause disease or increase the risk of disease are sometimes called mutations or pathogenic variants. Pathogenic variants in the
PMS2
gene cause more than 50 percent of cases of CMMRD, while pathogenic variants in the
MSH6
gene cause approximately 20 percent of cases. Pathogenic variants in the
MLH1
and
MSH2
genes are responsible for the remaining cases of CMMRD. These four genes are involved in repairing errors that occur when DNA is copied in preparation for cell division, a process called
DNA replication
. Because these genes work together to fix DNA errors, they are known as mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
The pathogenic variants that cause CMMRD reduce the amount of functional MMR protein. A shortage of any of the MMR proteins impairs the cell's ability to fix the errors that naturally occur during DNA replication. These errors can then accumulate and disrupt other genes that are involved in important cellular processes such as cell growth and cell division (proliferation). Uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer.
Particular pathogenic variants in MMR genes cause a form of CMMRD called attenuated CMMRD. One such pathogenic variant in the
PMS2
gene is found in the Nunavik population of Quebec, Canada. People with attenuated CMMRD typically develop cancer later in life, often in adulthood.

Inheritance
CMMRD is inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a pathogenic variant to cause the disorder.
The parents of an individual with CMMRD typically have a pathogenic variant in one copy of a gene associated with CMMRD in each of their cells. These parents have a cancer predisposition syndrome called
Lynch syndrome
. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, but also cancers of the stomach, small intestine, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, ovaries, endometrium, brain, and skin. Unlike CMMRD, individuals with Lynch syndrome develop these cancers in adulthood. People with CMMRD may not have a history of cancer in their family, as some people with a pathogenic variant in only one copy of an MMR gene do not develop cancer.
