Why is this medication prescribed?
Terazosin is used in men to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. It also is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Terazosin is in a class of medications called alpha-blockers. It relieves the symptoms of BPH by relaxing the muscles of the bladder and prostate. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body.
High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Terazosin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day at bedtime or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take terazosin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor will start you on a low dose of terazosin and gradually increase your dose. If you stop taking terazosin for a few days or longer, call your doctor. Your doctor usually will start you again on the lowest dose of terazosin and gradually increase your dose.
Terazosin controls high blood pressure and the symptoms of BPH but does not cure them. It may take 4 to 6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of terazosin for BPH. Continue to take terazosin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking terazosin without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking terazosin,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to terazosin, doxazosin (Cardura, Cardura XL), prazosin (Minipress), any other medications, or any ingredients in terazosin capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking terazosin. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had prostate cancer.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking terazosin, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking terazosin. If you need to have eye surgery at any time during or after your treatment, be sure to tell your doctor that you are taking or have taken terazosin.
you should know that terazosin may make you drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive a car, operate machinery or perform dangerous tasks for 12 hours after the first time you take terazosin or after your dose is increased, and until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that terazosin may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking terazosin, when your dose is increased, or when treatment with terazosin is stopped for several days and then restarted. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up. If you experience these symptoms, sit or lie down. If these symptoms do not improve, call your doctor.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking terazosin if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take terazosin to treat high blood pressure, because it is not as safe or effective as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Follow your doctor's directions for your meals, including advice for a reduced salt (sodium) diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Check with your doctor if you have missed two or more doses.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Terazosin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms or those listed in the SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS section are severe or do not go away:
weakness
tiredness
stuffy or runny nose
back pain
nausea
weight gain
decreased sexual ability
blurred vision
