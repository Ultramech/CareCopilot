Why is this medication prescribed?
Antipyrine and benzocaine otic is used to relieve ear pain and swelling caused by middle ear infections. It may be used along with antibiotics to treat an ear infection. It is also used to help remove a build up of ear wax in the ear. Antipyrine and benzocaine are in a class of medications called analgesics. The combination of antipyrine and benzocaine works by reducing pain and discomfort in the ear.
How should this medicine be used?
Antipyrine and benzocaine otic comes as a solution (liquid) to place into the ear. When antipyrine and benzocaine is used to relieve ear pain, it is usually used every 1 to 2 hours as needed. When antipyrine and benzocaine is used to help in the removal of ear wax, it is usually used 3 times daily for 2-3 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use antipyrine and benzocaine otic exactly as directed.
Antipyrine and benzocaine otic is for use only in the ears.
To use the eardrops, follow these steps:
Hold the bottle in your hand for 1 or 2 minutes to warm the solution.
Place the prescribed number of drops into your ear.
Be careful not to touch the tip to your ear, fingers, or any other surface.
Moisten a small piece of cotton with the drops and insert into the outer ear.
Repeat steps 2-4 for the opposite ear if necessary.
