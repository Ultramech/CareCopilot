Why is this medication prescribed?
Tretinoin (Altreno, Atralin, Avita, Retin-A) is used to treat acne. Tretinoin is also used to reduce fine wrinkles (Refissa and Renova) and to improve spotty discoloration (Renova) and rough feeling skin (Renova) when used along with other skin care and sunlight avoidance programs. Tretinoin is in a class of medications called retinoids. It works by promoting peeling of affected skin areas and unclogging pores.
How should this medicine be used?
Tretinoin comes as a lotion (Altreno), cream (Avita, Refissa, Renova, Retin-A), and gel (Atralin, Avita, Retin-A). Tretinoin usually is used daily at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use tretinoin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Tretinoin controls acne but does not cure it. Your acne probably will get worse (red, scaling skin and an increase in acne sores) during the first 7 to10 days that you use this medication. Nevertheless, continue to use it; the acne sores should disappear. Usually 2 to 3 weeks (and sometimes more than 6 weeks) of regular use of tretinoin is required before improvement is seen.
Tretinoin may reduce fine wrinkles, spotty discoloration, and rough feeling skin but does not cure them. It may take 3 to 4 months or up to 6 months before you notice improvement. If you stop using tretinoin, the improvement may gradually disappear.
Use only nonmedicated cosmetics on cleansed skin. Do not use topical preparations with a lot of alcohol, menthol, spices, or lime (e.g., shaving lotions, astringents, and perfumes); they can sting your skin, especially when you first use tretinoin.
Do not use any other topical medications, especially benzoyl peroxide, hair removers, salicylic acid (wart remover), and dandruff shampoos containing sulfur or resorcinol unless your doctor directs you to do so. If you have used any of these topical medications recently, ask your doctor if you should wait before using tretinoin.
Your doctor may tell you to use moisturizer to help with dryness.
If you are to apply any form of tretinoin, follow these steps:
Wash your hands and affected skin area thoroughly with mild, bland soap (not medicated or abrasive soap or soap that dries the skin) and water. To be sure that your skin is thoroughly dry, wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin.
Use clean fingertips to apply the medication.
Use enough medication to cover the affected area with a thin layer.
Apply the medication to the affected skin area only. Do not let tretinoin get into your eyes, ears, mouth, corners along your nose, or vaginal area. Do not apply on areas of sunburn.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
