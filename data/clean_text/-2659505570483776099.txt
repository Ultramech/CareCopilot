FOXP2-related speech and language disorder
Description
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder affects the development of speech and language beginning in early childhood. Affected individuals have a condition known as childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), which makes it difficult to produce the sequences of sounds and syllables needed to form words. CAS is caused by abnormalities in the parts of
the brain
that plan and coordinate the movements of the lips, mouth, and tongue. Children with
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder say their first words later than other children, typically between 18 months and 7 years of age. Their speech is often difficult to understand, although the clarity of speech usually improves over time.
In addition to having problems with producing speech (expressive language), people with
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder may have difficulty understanding speech (receptive language). Some affected individuals also have trouble with other language-related skills, such as reading, spelling, and grammar.
Less commonly, individuals with
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder have features of
autism spectrum disorder
, which is a condition characterized by impaired social skills and communication problems. Some affected individuals have difficulty with motor skills such as walking, writing, or buttoning clothes, but these typically improve with treatment. Some affected individuals may have learning difficulties.
Frequency
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder is a rare disorder, although its exact prevalence is unknown. CAS affects approximately 1 to 2 in 1,000 people, but it is thought that
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder accounts for only a small portion of these cases.
Causes
Variants (also called mutations) in the
FOXP2
gene cause
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder. The
FOXP2
gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a transcription factor, which means that it controls the activity of other genes. Researchers suspect that this protein plays an important role in the functioning of synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells (neurons) where cell-to-cell communication occurs.
In people with
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder, variants in the
FOXP2
gene cause cells to produce an abnormal version of the FOXP2 protein that does not function properly. Because the FOXP2 protein is a transcription factor, changes in the protein's activity affect the activity of other genes in the developing brain. Researchers suspect that many of the genes targeted by the FOXP2 protein play important roles in brain development and the connections between neurons.
The
FOXP2
gene is one of the genes found on chromosome 7. When large deletions or rearrangements of genetic material on this chromosome affect the
FOXP2
gene and neighboring genes, it can cause a disorder known as
FOXP2
-plus-related speech and language disorder. Because other genes are involved, individuals with
FOXP2
-plus-related speech and language disorder are more likely to have features such as developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder than individuals who only have a variant in the
FOXP2
gene.

FOXP2
Inheritance
FOXP2
-related speech and language disorder is inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern
, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In approximately 50 percent of cases, the condition results from a new (de novo) variant in the gene that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual's parent or during early embryonic development. These affected individuals typically have no history of the disorder in their family.
The inheritance of
FOXP2
-plus-related speech and language disorder is more complex and depends on the specific genetic change.
