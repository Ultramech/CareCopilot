Why is this medication prescribed?
Cefpodoxime is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as bronchitis (infection of the airway tubes leading to the lungs); pneumonia; gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease); and infections of the skin, ear, sinuses, throat, tonsils, and urinary tract. Cefpodoxime is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.
Antibiotics such as cefpodoxime will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Cefpodoxime comes as a tablet and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days depending on the condition being treated. A single dose is given to treat gonorrhea. Take the tablet with food; the suspension can be taken with or without food. Take cefpodoxime at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefpodoxime exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefpodoxime. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
Continue to take cefpodoxime until you finish the prescription even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefpodoxime too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics..
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
