Why is this medication prescribed?
Cefadroxil is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as infections of the skin, throat, tonsils, and urinary tract. Cefadroxil is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.
Antibiotics such as cefadroxil will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Cefadroxil comes as a capsule, tablet, and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 12 or 24 hours . Take cefadroxil at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefadroxil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Take cefadroxil with food to reduce nausea and stomach upset.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefadroxil. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
Continue to take cefadroxil until you finish the prescription even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefadroxil too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Other uses for this medicine
Cefadroxil is also sometimes used for certain penicillin allergic patients who have a heart condition and are having a dental or upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, voice box) procedure, in order to prevent them from developing a heart valve infection.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
