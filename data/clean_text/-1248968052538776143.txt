Why is this medication prescribed?
Topical clotrimazole is used to treat tinea corporis (ringworm; fungal skin infection that causes a red scaly rash on different parts of the body), tinea cruris (jock itch; fungal infection of the skin in the groin or buttocks), and tinea pedis (athlete's foot; fungal infection of the skin on the feet and between the toes). Clotrimazole is in a class of antifungal medications called imidazoles. It works by stopping the growth of fungi that cause infection.
How should this medicine be used?
Topical clotrimazole comes as a cream and liquid to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day (morning and night). Follow the directions on the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use clotrimazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package or as directed by your doctor.
Topical clotrimazole is only for use on the skin. Do not let clotrimazole get into your eyes and do not swallow the medication. Clotrimazole does not work on the scalp or nails.
If you are using clotrimazole to treat jock itch, your symptoms should improve over 2 weeks of treatment. If you are using clotrimazole to treat athlete's foot or ringworm, your symptoms should improve over 4 weeks of treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time or if your symptoms get worse at any time during your treatment.
To use topical clotrimazole, wash the affected area and dry thoroughly. Then apply a small amount of cream or liquid to cover the affected area of skin with a thin layer.
If you are treating athlete's foot, pay special attention to the spaces between the toes when applying clotrimazole. Also, be sure to wear well-fitting shoes that allow for air circulation, and change shoes and socks at least once a day.
If you are using the liquid, do not apply it to any severely cracked or irritated areas.
Other uses for this medicine
Topical clotrimazole may be used to treat tinea versicolor (fungal infection of the skin that causes brown or light colored spots on the chest, back, arms, legs, or neck) or yeast infections of the skin. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using topical clotrimazole,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to clotrimazole, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in clotrimazole cream or liquid. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using clotrimazole, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double amount to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Clotrimazole may cause side effects. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop using clotrimazole and call your doctor:
blistering, redness, swelling, itching, burning, stinging, peeling, hives, or skin cracks
Clotrimazole may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
