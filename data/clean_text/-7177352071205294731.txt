Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
Description
Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) deficiency is a condition that disrupts the breakdown of certain proteins. Normally, proteins from food are broken down into amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for growth and development. People with IBD deficiency have problems breaking down the amino acid valine.
Most people with IBD deficiency are asymptomatic, which means that they do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. If signs or symptoms do appear, they typically show early in life and only last for a short period of time. These signs and symptoms can include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delays, slow growth, a low number of red blood cells (
anemia
), and seizures. Because IBD deficiency is rare and often does not cause signs and symptoms, it is difficult to know if the health problems seen in affected individuals are caused by this condition or if those health problems are unrelated to the condition. It is also unclear whether IBD deficiency causes health problems later in life.
Newborn screening, which identifies abnormal levels of certain compounds in the blood, can detect IBD deficiency. People with IBD deficiency have high levels of a compound called carnitine (specifically a form called C4-acylcarnitine). Cells use carnitine, a natural substance that is acquired mostly through the diet, to process fats and produce energy.
Frequency
IBD deficiency is a rare disorder. Worldwide, the prevalence of this disorder is estimated to vary from 1 in 52,000 to 292,000 people.
Causes
Variants (also called mutations) in the
ACAD8
gene cause IBD deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making the IBD enzyme. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy producing centers inside cells. Within mitochondria, the IBD enzyme is involved in breaking down valine. Specifically, this enzyme functions in the third step of this process, which converts the molecule isobutyryl-CoA to the molecule methacrylyl-CoA. This is a critical step in the process of converting the energy from food into a form that cells can use.
ACAD8
gene variants reduce or eliminate the activity of the IBD enzyme. As a result, valine cannot be broken down properly. This may lead to reduced energy production and cause the features of IBD deficiency in some people.

ACAD8
Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
