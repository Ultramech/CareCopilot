Notice:
On June 30, 2025, FDA issued a drug safety communication about a risk of weight loss in patients younger than 6 years of age taking extended-release stimulants for ADHD and will be revising the labeling for all these products to reflect this new safety information. Although extended-release stimulants are not approved for children younger than 6 years, health care professionals can prescribe them “off label” to treat ADHD. For additional information, see

.
IMPORTANT WARNING:
Methylphenidate can be habit-forming. Take methylpenidate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much methylphenidate, the medication may no longer work as well and you may feel a need to take more of it, and you may experience unusual changes in your behavior. Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications.
Do not stop taking methylphenidate without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop severe depression if you suddenly stop taking methylphenidate after overusing it. Your doctor may need to monitor you carefully after you stop taking methylphenidate, even if you have not overused the medication, because your symptoms may worsen when treatment is stopped.
Do not sell, give away, or let anyone else take your medication. Selling or giving away methylphenidate may harm others and is against the law. Store methylphenidate in a safe place so no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how much medication is left so you will know if any is missing.
You will be given the manufacturer's patient information sheet Medication Guide when you begin treatment with methylphenidate and each time you get more medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Methylphenidate is used to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; condition that makes it hard to pay attention, control your behavior, and remain still or quiet) and to treat narcolepsy (condition that causes people to be very sleepy during the day and to fall asleep suddenly). Methylphenidate is in a class of medications called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Methylphenidate comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, a solution (liquid), a suspension (liquid), an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), a long-acting (extended-release) tablet, and a long-acting capsule to take by mouth. Your doctor will tell you how often to take methylphenidate and how you should take it. This depends on the dosage form that you are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about taking methylphenidate.
Do not try to push the orally disintegrating tablet through the blister pack foil. Instead, use dry hands and peel back the foil. Immediately take out the tablet and place it in your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva; no water is needed to swallow the tablet.
Swallow the long-acting tablets and capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Tell your doctor if you have problems swallowing. Your doctor will tell you how to take methylphenidate.
If you are taking the suspension, your doctor with give you the manufacturer's instructions for use. These instructions describe how to measure and take a dose of the suspension. Read these instructions and follow them carefully. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of methylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.
Your condition should improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen at any time during your treatment or do not improve after 1 month.
Your doctor may tell you to stop taking methylphenidate from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.
Some methylphenidate products may not be able to be substituted for another. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of methylphenidate product your doctor has prescribed.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking methylphenidate,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medications or have stopped taking them within the past two weeks: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.
some medications should not be taken with methylphenidate. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with methylphenidate. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before taking methylphenidate with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking methylphenidate, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.
tell your doctor if anyone in you or anyone in your family has or has ever had an irregular heartbeat or has died suddenly, a heart defect, or any other heart problem; high blood pressure; Tourette's syndrome (a condition that causes sudden repeated motions, sounds or words), facial or motor tics (repeated uncontrollable movements), or verbal tics (repeated sounds or words that are hard to control); depression, bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited), mania (abnormally excited mood), has thought about or attempted suicide, or other mental problems; glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye that may cause vision loss) or other vision problems; circulation problems in your fingers or toes; seizures; an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG; a test that measures electrical activity in the brain); or narrowing or blockage of your digestive system.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking methylphenidate, call your doctor.

if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking methylphenidate.
ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking methylphenidate. Alcohol can make the side effects from methylphenidate worse.
if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent brain damage that can cause severe disability), you should know that the chewable tablets contain aspartame that forms phenylalanine.
you should know that methylphenidate should be used as part of a total treatment program for ADHD, which may include counseling and special education. Make sure to follow all of your doctor's and/or therapist's instructions.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how late in the day you should take a missed dose of your medication so that it will not cause difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
If you are taking methylphenidate at night, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it that night. However, if it is already the next morning, skip the missed dose of the long-acting capsule and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
