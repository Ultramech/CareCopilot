IMPORTANT WARNING:
Combination hormone replacement therapy (estrogen and progestin) may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots in the lungs and legs, and breast cancer. Tell your doctor if you smoke and if you have or have ever had a breast lump; breast cancer; a heart attack; a stroke; blood clots or blood clotting problems; high blood pressure; high blood levels of cholesterol or fats; lupus (an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy parts of the body such as joints, skin, blood vessels, and organs); or diabetes. If you are having surgery or will be on bedrest, talk to your doctor about stopping estrogen and progestin at least 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bedrest.
If you experience any of the following side effects, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; sudden partial or complete loss of vision; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; a lump in your breast; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; or calf pain.
Combination hormone replacement therapy also may increase the risk of dementia (decrease in thinking, remembering, and reasoning).
Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking estrogen and progestin.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Combinations of estrogen and progestin are used to treat certain symptoms of menopause. Estrogen also prevents thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in menopausal women. Your doctor will select the product that is best to treat your condition. Estrogen and progestin are two female sex hormones. Hormone replacement therapy works by replacing estrogen hormone that is no longer being made by the body. Estrogen reduces feelings of warmth in the upper body and periods of sweating and heat (hot flashes), vaginal symptoms (itching, burning, and dryness) and difficulty with urination. Progestin is added to estrogen in hormone replacement therapy to reduce the risk of uterine cancer in women who still have their uterus.
How should this medicine be used?
Hormone replacement therapy comes as a tablet or capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take hormone replacement therapy, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take this medication exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking this medication without talking to your doctor.
