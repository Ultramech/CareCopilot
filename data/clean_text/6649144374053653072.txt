Why is this medication prescribed?
Hyoscyamine is used to control symptoms associated with disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It works by decreasing the motion of the stomach and intestines and the secretion of stomach fluids, including acid. Hyoscyamine is also used in the treatment of bladder spasms, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, colic, irritable bowel syndrome, cystitis, and pancreatitis. Hyoscyamine may also be used to treat certain heart conditions, to control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and rhinitis (runny nose), and to reduce excess saliva production.
How should this medicine be used?
Hyoscyamine comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) capsule, and a liquid to take by mouth. The tablets and liquid are usually taken three or four times a day. The extended-release capsules are usually taken twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take hyoscyamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Hyoscyamine controls symptoms associated with disorders of the GI tract, but it does not cure the disorders. Continue to take hyoscyamine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking hyoscyamine without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking hyoscyamine,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to hyoscyamine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in hyoscyamine tablets, capsules, or liquid. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking pr plan to take while taking hyoscyamine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
be aware that antacids may interfere with hyoscyamine, making it less effective. Take hyoscyamine 1 hour before or 2 hours after antacids.
the following nonprescription products may interact with hyoscyamine: allergy medications (diphenhydramine, loratadine, fexofenadine, chlorpheniramine or cetirizine). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking hyoscyamine. Do not start any of these medications while taking hyoscyamine without discussing with your healthcare provider.

talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking hyoscyamine if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take hyoscyamine because it is not as safe and may not be as effective as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.

Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
