Why is this medication prescribed?
Hydrocortisone topical is used to treat redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort of various skin conditions. Hydrocortisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by activating natural substances in the skin to reduce swelling, redness, and itching.
How should this medicine be used?
Hydrocortisone comes as ointment, cream, solution (liquid), spray, or lotion for use on the skin. Hydrocortisone topical is usually used one to four times a day for skin problems. Apply it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription or product label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use hydrocortisone exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor.
If your doctor has prescribed hydrocortisone for your condition, call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve in the first 2 weeks of your treatment. If you obtained hydrocortisone without a prescription (over the counter) and your condition does not improve within 7 days, stop using it and call your doctor.
To use hydrocortisone topical, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, solution, spray, or lotion to cover the affected area of skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently.
This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let hydrocortisone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it.
Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. If you have psoriasis, your doctor may recommend an occlusive dressing.
If you are applying hydrocortisone topical to a child's diaper area, do not cover the area with tight fitting diapers or plastic pants.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using hydrocortisone topical,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to hydrocortisone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in hydrocortisone topical products. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes or Cushing's syndrome (an abnormal condition that is caused by excess hormones [corticosteroids]).
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using hydrocortisone topical, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double amount to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Hydrocortisone topical may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
burning, itching, irritation, redness, or dryness of the skin
acne
unwanted hair growth
skin color changes
tiny red bumps or rash around the mouth

Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately:
