Why is this medication prescribed?
C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) is used to treat acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE; an inherited condition that causes episodes of swelling in the hands, feet, face, airway, or intestines) in adults and adolescents 13 years of age or older. C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) is in a class of medications called complement inhibitors. It works by replacing C1-esterase inhibitor that is normally produced by the body and that helps control inflammation and swelling.
How should this medicine be used?
C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) comes as a powder in a vial to be mixed with a liquid to inject intravenously (into a vein) over a period of about 5 minutes. C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) injection is usually used when needed at the start of an HAE attack, according to your doctor's directions. If your symptoms do not respond to an initial dose of C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) injection, your doctor may tell you to inject a second dose. If your symptoms do not improve after you inject a second dose, call your doctor. You should not use more than 2 doses in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor or nurse will show you or a caregiver how to mix and inject a dose of C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) injection at home. Before you use C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) injection for the first time, you and the person who will be giving the injections should read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with it. These instructions describe how to mix and inject a dose of C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant). Be sure that you understand these directions. Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions about when you should use the medication, where on your body you should inject the medication, how to give the injection, what type of syringe to use, or how to dispose of used needles and syringes after you inject the medication. Always keep a spare syringe and needle on hand.
You should mix the medication right before you plan to inject it. However, you may mix the medication in advance, store it in the refrigerator, and use within 8 hours. Be sure to take the medication out of the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature before you inject it.
Always look at C1-esterase inhibitor (recombinant) solution before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear and colorless. The liquid should not contain visible particles. Do not use if it is expired or if the liquid is colored, cloudy, or contains particles.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.

Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had atherosclerosis (narrowing of the blood vessels from fatty deposits) or blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, brain, or anywhere in the body.
