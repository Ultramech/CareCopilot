IMPORTANT WARNING:
People who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as meclofenamate may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke, if you smoke, and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech.
If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not take meclofenamate right before or right after the surgery.
NSAIDs such as meclofenamate may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. These problems may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, or drink large amounts of alcohol while taking meclofenamate. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin
®
); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil
®
, Motrin
®
) and naproxen (Aleve
®
, Naprosyn
®
); or oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron
®
, Dexone
®
), methylprednisolone (Medrol
®
), and prednisone (Deltasone
®
). Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers, bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking meclofenamate and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools.
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to meclofenamate. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with meclofenamate and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs
) to obtain the Medication Guide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Meclofenamate is used to relieve pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints), rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints), juvenile arthritis(chronic inflammatory disease causing pain, swelling and stiffness in joints of children), ankylosing spondylitis (type of arthritis that can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints), acute painful shoulder(pain and immobility in shoulder that happens suddenly for a number of reasons), and acute gouty arthritis(sudden attack of joint inflammation, pain, redness and swelling). It is also used to relieve other types of mild to moderate pain, including menstrual pain (pain that happens before or during a menstrual period). It also may be used to decrease bleeding in women who have abnormally heavy menstrual blood loss. Meclofenamate can also be used to reduce fever in adults. Meclofenamate is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain, fever, and inflammation.
How should this medicine be used?
Meclofenamate comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis, three times a day for heavy menstrual blood loss, or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Meclofenamate may be taken with food or milk to prevent nausea. If you take meclofenamate regularly, take it at the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take meclofenamate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you are taking meclofenamate to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, your bleeding should decrease during your treatment. Call your doctor if your bleeding does not decrease or if you experience spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods.
If you are taking meclofenamate to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, your symptoms may begin to improve within a few days. It may take 2 to 3 weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of meclofenamate.
