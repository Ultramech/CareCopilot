Why is this medication prescribed?
Cefoxitin injection is used to treat infections caused by bacteria including pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract (lung) infections; and urinary tract, abdominal (stomach area), female reproductive organs, blood, bone, joint, and skin infections. Cefoxitin injection may also be used before and during surgery, in order to prevent the patient from getting an infection. Cefoxitin injection is in a class of medications called cephamycin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.
Antibiotics such as cefoxitin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
How should this medicine be used?
Cefoxitin injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein). Cefoxitin injection is also available as a premixed product to be injected intravenously. It is usually given every six or eight hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how your body responds to the medication.
You may receive cefoxitin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving cefoxitin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefoxitin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
Use cefoxitin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using cefoxitin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
Other uses for this medicine
Cefoxitin injection is also sometimes used to treat gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

you should know that cefoxitin injection may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections). You will need to use another method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while receiving cefoxitin injection. Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medication.

What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Use the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.
