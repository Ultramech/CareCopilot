IMPORTANT WARNING:
If you have hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection) and you take tenofovir alafenamide (AF), your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking this medication. Be careful not to miss doses or run out of tenofovir AF. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with tenofovir AF. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking this medication. Tell your doctor if you experience any new or unusual symptoms after you stop taking tenofovir AF.
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking tenofovir.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Tenofovir alafenamide (AF) is used to treat chronic (long term) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HBV in the blood.
Tenofovir AF will not cure hepatitis B and may not prevent complications of chronic hepatitis B. Tenofovir AF may not prevent the spread of hepatitis B to other people.
How should this medicine be used?
Tenofovir AF comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take with food once daily. Take tenofovir AF at around the same time every day.
Take tenofovir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Continue to take tenofovir AF even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tenofovir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking tenofovir AF even for a short time, or skip doses, the virus may become resistant to medications and may be harder to treat.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?

tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
