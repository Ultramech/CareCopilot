Why is this medication prescribed?
Secobarbital is used on a short-term basis to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). It is also used to relieve anxiety before surgery. Secobarbital is in a class of medications called barbiturates. It works by slowing activity in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Secobarbital comes as a capsule to take by mouth. When secobarbital is used to treat insomnia, it is usually taken at bedtime as needed for sleep. When secobarbital is used to relieve anxiety before surgery, it is usually taken 1 to 2 hours before surgery. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take secobarbital exactly as directed.
Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking secobarbital. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior.
Secobarbital should normally be taken for short periods of time. If you take secobarbital for 2 weeks or longer, secobarbital may not help you sleep as well as it did when you first began to take the medication. If you take secobarbital for a long time, you may also develop dependence ('addiction,' a need to continue taking the medication) on secobarbital. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking secobarbital for 2 weeks or longer. Do not take a larger dose of secobarbital, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.
Do not stop taking secobarbital without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking secobarbital, you may develop anxiety, muscle twitching, uncontrollable shaking of your hands or fingers, weakness, dizziness, changes in vision, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or you may experience more severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures or extreme confusion.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking secobarbital,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to secobarbital; other barbiturates such as amobarbital (Amytal, in Tuinal), butabarbital (Butisol), pentobarbital, or phenobarbital; any other medications, or any of the ingredients in secobarbital capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking secobarbital. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
the following nonprescription products may interact with secobarbital: allergy medications (diphenhydramine, loratadine, fexofenadine, chlorpheniramine or cetirizine). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking secobarbital. Do not start any of these medications while taking secobarbital without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had porphyria (condition in which certain natural substances build up in the body and may cause stomach pain, changes in thinking and behavior, and other symptoms); any condition that causes shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; or liver disease. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take secobarbital.
tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications.Also tell your doctor if you have ever thought about killing yourself or tried to do so and if you have or have ever had depression; pain; or kidney disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking secobarbital, call your doctor.
you should know that secobarbital may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, injections, implants, or intrauterine devices). Talk to your doctor about methods of birth control that will work for you while you are taking secobarbital. Tell your doctor if you have a missed period or think you may be pregnant while you are taking secobarbital.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this medication if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take secobarbital to treat conditions other than seizures because it is not as safe as other medications that can be used to treat the same conditions.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking secobarbital.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy during the daytime. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
do not drink alcohol during your treatment with secobarbital. Alcohol can make the side effects of secobarbital worse.
you should know that some people who took medications for sleep got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, or were involved in other activities while partially asleep. After they woke up, these people were usually unable to remember what they had done. Call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else while you were sleeping.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Secobarbital is usually taken at bedtime. If you forget to take secobarbital at bedtime, you are unable to fall asleep, and you will still be able to stay in bed for a full night's sleep, you may take secobarbital at that time. Do not take a double dose of secobarbital to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?

difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep
nightmares
