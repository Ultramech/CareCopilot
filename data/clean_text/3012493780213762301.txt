IMPORTANT WARNING:
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Do not take irbesartan if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while you are taking irbesartan, stop taking irbesartan and call your doctor immediately. Irbesartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Irbesartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is also used to treat kidney disease caused by diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) and high blood pressure. Irbesartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.
High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Irbesartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take irbesartan, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take irbesartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of irbesartan and gradually increase your dose.
Irbesartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. It may take 2 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of irbesartan. Continue to take irbesartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking irbesartan without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
Irbesartan is also used sometimes to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking irbesartan,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to irbesartan, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in irbesartan tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor if you have diabetes (high blood sugar) and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take irbesartan if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.
some medications should not be taken with irbesartan. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with irbesartan. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting irbesartan with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking irbesartan, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.
the following nonprescription products may interact with irbesartan: potassium supplements; aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking irbesartan. Do not start any of these medications while taking irbesartan without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart failure, or kidney disease.
tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.
you should know that irbesartan may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking irbesartan. To help avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.
you should know that diarrhea, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, and sweating a lot can cause a drop in blood pressure, which may cause lightheadedness and fainting. Tell your doctor if you have any of these problems or develop them during your treatment.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Do not use salt substitutes containing potassium without talking to your doctor. If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Irbesartan may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
diarrhea
heartburn
excessive tiredness
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS section, call your doctor immediately:
