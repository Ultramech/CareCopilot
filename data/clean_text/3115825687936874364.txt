IMPORTANT WARNING:
Taking too much acetaminophen (found in this combination preparation) can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death. Be aware that you should not take more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen per day. You might accidentally take too much acetaminophen if you do not follow the directions on the prescription or package label carefully, or if you take more than one product that contains acetaminophen. If you need to take more than one product that contains acetaminophen, it may be difficult for you to calculate the total amount of acetaminophen you are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to help you. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine is used to relieve tension headaches. Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain. Butalbital is in a class of medications called barbiturates. It works by having a relaxing effect on the brain and central nervous system (CNS). Caffeine is a CNS stimulant. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine comes as a capsule and tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken every 4 hours as needed. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine exactly as directed. Do not take more than six tablets or capsules in 1 day. If you think that you need more to relieve your symptoms, call your doctor.
This medication can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.
