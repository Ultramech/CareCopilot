Why is this medication prescribed?
Amlodipine is used to treat high blood pressure and certain types of angina (chest pain) and coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). Amlodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. It controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to the heart. If taken regularly, amlodipine controls chest pain, but it does not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain.
Untreated high blood pressure can damage the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. This damage may cause heart disease, a heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. Along with medication, making the following changes will also help to control your blood pressure: eating a diet low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Amlodipine comes as a tablet, an oral solution (liquid), and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food. Take amlodipine around the same time every day.
Take amlodipine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
Use a dosing cup or oral syringe to measure the prescribed amount of suspension or solution. Do not use a household teaspoon or tablespoon. Ask your pharmacist for help selecting the right measuring tool.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amlodipine and gradually increase your dose.
Amlodipine helps to control high blood pressure, angina, and coronary artery disease, but does not cure these conditions. Continue to take amlodipine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking amlodipine without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking amlodipine,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this medication, any part of this medication, or any other medications, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart failure or heart or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking amlodipine, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is less than 12 hours until your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Amlodipine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
nausea
stomach pain
dizziness or lightheadedness
drowsiness
excessive tiredness
flushing
muscle stiffness or tremors
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the tablets and oral solution at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store the suspension in the refrigerator and avoid freezing; protect it from light.
