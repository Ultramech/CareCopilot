Primary ciliary dyskinesia
Description
Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder that is characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and difficulties having biological children (decreased fertility). The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and
flagella
. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia help cells move where they are needed; they also help move substances within the body. Flagella, which are similar to cilia, are tail-like structures that propel sperm cells forward.
Without properly functioning cilia, people with primary ciliary dyskinesia often have problems removing fluid and particles from their airways. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth (neonatal respiratory distress), which suggests that cilia also play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Children with primary ciliary dyskinesia typically have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough beginning in the first year of life. Because affected individuals also have trouble removing bacteria from the respiratory tract, they may experience frequent respiratory tract infections beginning in early childhood. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages that lead from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi). Bronchiectasis can cause life-threatening breathing problems.
Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if left untreated. These ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear.
About 40 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For example, the heart is on the right side of the body instead of the left in these individuals. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. Situs inversus totalis does not typically cause additional health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome.
Heterotaxy syndrome (sometimes also called situs ambiguous) is another disorder of organ development that can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Approximately 9 to 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have heterotaxy syndrome, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia). Heterotaxy syndrome is also a result of problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy syndrome varies widely among affected individuals, and people with this condition may have heart abnormalities that can be life-threatening.
Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also cause fertility problems. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia often have decreased fertility. Decreased fertility also occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes, which impairs the movement of the egg cell from the ovary to the uterus.
In rare cases, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Researchers do not fully understand why some people with primary ciliary dyskinesia develop hydrocephalus.
Frequency
It is estimated that as many as 1 in 7,500 people worldwide have primary ciliary dyskinesia.
Causes
Variants (also called mutations) in one of over 50 different genes can cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. Many of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that form the inner structure of cilia and produce the force needed for cilia to bend. Coordinated back and forth movement of cilia is necessary for the normal functioning of many organs and tissues. The movement of cilia also supports cell transport and helps establish the left-right axis (the imaginary line that separates the left and right sides of the body) during embryonic development.
Many of the variants that cause primary ciliary dyskinesia disrupt the coordinated movement of cilia. Because cilia have many important functions within the body, abnormalities in the structure or function of cilia can cause a variety of signs and symptoms.
Variants in the
DNAH5
and
DNAH11
genes account for approximately 33 percent of all cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia. These genes provide instructions for producing proteins that are part of a larger group of proteins (a complex) called dynein. Dynein makes up the structures (arms) within the cilia that generate the force needed for cilia to move.
Variants in the
CCDC40
gene account for approximately 9 percent of cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia. This gene provides instructions for producing a protein that helps with the proper assembly of dynein arms. This protein also helps assemble a protein complex that regulates the movement of the dynein arms.
Variants in each of the other genes associated with this condition are found in only a small percentage of cases. In 20 to 30 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia, the cause of the disorder is unknown.

Inheritance
Primary ciliary dyskinesia is typically inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
In some cases, primary ciliary dyskinesia is inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered to follow an X-linked pattern if the altered gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two
sex chromosomes
in each cell. In males (who have only one X chromosome) a variant in the only copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two copies of the X chromosome) one altered copy of the gene may or may not cause the features of the condition.
In rare cases, primary ciliary dyskinesia is inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern
, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, the condition is a result of new (de novo) variants in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual's parent or during early embryonic development. These affected individuals typically have no history of the disorder in their family.
