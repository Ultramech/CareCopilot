Why is this medication prescribed?
Tolnaftate stops the growth of fungi that cause skin infections, including athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
How should this medicine be used?
Tolnaftate comes as a cream, liquid, powder, gel, spray powder, and spray liquid for application to the skin. Tolnaftate usually is applied twice a day. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use tolnaftate exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed by your doctor.
The burning and soreness of athlete's foot or the itching of jock itch should decrease within 2 to 3 days. Continue treatment for at least 2 weeks after symptoms disappear. A total of 4-6 weeks of treatment may be necessary.
Thoroughly clean the infected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. You should wash your hands after applying the medication.
Spray and powder forms should be applied between the toes; socks and shoes should be treated lightly. Sprays should be shaken well before each use to mix the medication and then sprayed from a distance of at least 6 inches.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using tolnaftate,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tolnaftate or any other drugs.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using tolnaftate, call your doctor.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Tolnaftate may cause side effects. If you experience the following symptom, call your doctor:
skin irritation
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not puncture spray cans or throw them into a fire.
Dispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website

Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.

What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor. Tolnaftate is for external use only. Do not let tolnaftate get into your eyes, nose, or mouth, and do not swallow it. Do not apply dressings, bandages, cosmetics, lotions, or other skin medications to the area being treated unless your doctor tells you.
Do not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish the tolnaftate, call your doctor.
Keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.
