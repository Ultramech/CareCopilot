IMPORTANT WARNING:
Do not take benazepril if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking benazepril, call your doctor immediately. Benazepril may harm the fetus.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Benazepril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly.
High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Benazepril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take benazepril, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take benazepril exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of benazepril and gradually increase your dose.
Benazepril controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take benazepril even if you feel well. Do not stop taking benazepril without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking benazepril,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to benazepril; other ACE inhibitors such as captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec, in Vaseretic), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (in Prinzide, in Zestoretic), moexipril (Univasc, in Uniretic), perindopril (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril, in Accuretic, in Quinaretic), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik, in Tarka); any other medications; or any ingredients in benazepril tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking valsartan and sacubitril (Entresto) or if you have stopped taking it within the last 36 hours. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take benazepril, if you are also taking valsartan and sacubitril. Also, tell your doctor if you have diabetes and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take benazepril if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.
some medications should not be taken with benazepril. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with benazepril. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting benazepril with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking benazepril, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist. .
the following nonprescription products may interact with benazepril: aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve); potassium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking benazepril. Do not start any of these medications while taking benazepril without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have recently had severe diarrhea or vomiting and if you have diabetes, heart failure, kidney disease, lupus, or scleroderma (a condition in which extra tissue grows on the skin and some organs).
tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking benazepril.
you should know that diarrhea, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, and sweating a lot can cause a drop in blood pressure, which may cause lightheadedness and fainting.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Talk to your doctor before using salt substitutes containing potassium. If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
