Why is this medication prescribed?
Progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy. Progestin is a female hormone. It works by preventing the release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation) and changing the cervical mucus and the lining of the uterus. Progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives are a very effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
How should this medicine be used?
Progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives come as tablets to take by mouth. They are taken once a day, every day at the same time. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives come in packs of 28 tablets. Begin the next pack the day after the last pack is finished.
Your doctor will tell you when you should start taking your progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptive. Tell your doctor if you are switching from another type of contraception (other birth control pills, vaginal ring, transdermal patch, implant, injection, intrauterine device [IUD]).
If you vomit soon after taking a progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives, you may have to use a backup method of birth control for the next 48 hours. Talk to your doctor about this before you begin to take your oral contraceptive so that you can prepare a backup method of birth control in case it is needed.
