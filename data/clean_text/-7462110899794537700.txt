IMPORTANT WARNING:
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Do not take azilsartan if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while you are taking azilsartan, stop taking azilsartan and call your doctor immediately. Azilsartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Azilsartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Azilsartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.
High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Azilsartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take azilsartan, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take azilsartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Azilsartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. It may take about 2 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of azilsartan. Continue to take azilsartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking azilsartan without talking to your doctor.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking azilsartan,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to azilsartan, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in azilsartan tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
Some medications should not be taken with azilsartan. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with azilsartan. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting azilsartan with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking azilsartan, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.
The following nonprescription products may interact with azilsartan: aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and potassium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking azilsartan. Do not start any of these medications while taking azilsartan without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart failure, or kidney or liver disease.

you should know that azilsartan may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking azilsartan. To help avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.
you should know that diarrhea, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, and sweating a lot can cause a drop in blood pressure, which may cause lightheadedness and fainting. Tell your doctor if you have any of these problems or develop them during your treatment.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Do not use salt substitutes containing potassium without talking to your doctor. If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
