Why is this medication prescribed?
Topical nystatin is used to treat fungal infections of the skin. Nystatin is in a class of antifungal medications called polyenes. It works by stopping the growth of fungi that cause infection.
How should this medicine be used?
Nystatin comes as a cream, ointment and powder to apply to the skin. Nystatin cream and ointment is usually applied twice a day to the affected area. Nystatin powder is usually used two or three times a day. Use nystatin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nystatin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you are using powder for infected feet, dust the powder inside your shoes and stockings as well as on your feet.
Topical nystatin is only for use on the skin. Do not let nystatin get into your vagina, eyes, or mouth, and do not swallow the medication.
Use nystatin as long as instructed by your doctor, even if you feel better. If you stop using nystatin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using topical nystatin,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to nystatin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in nystatin cream, ointment, or powder. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using nystatin, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply extra cream, ointment, or powder to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Nystatin may cause side effects. Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop using nystatin and call your doctor immediately:
burning or pain in area where applied
rash, hives, or itching
difficulty breathing or swallowing
Nystatin may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not allow nystatin to freeze.
Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.

for more information.
In case of emergency/overdose
If someone swallows topical nystatin, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911.
What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to nystatin.
Do not let anyone else use your medication. Your prescription is probably not refillable. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish the nystatin, call your doctor.
Keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.
